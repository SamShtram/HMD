"Newswise — Thousands of people can take heart as new research from the University of South Australia shows a dairy-enhanced Mediterranean diet will significantly increase health outcomes for those at risk of cardiovascular disease – and it’s even more effective than a low-fat diet.

Cardiovascular disease takes the lives of 17.9 million people every year, representing 31 per cent of all global deaths. In Australia, it is the single leading cause of death in Australia, affecting 4.2 million Australians and killing one Australian every 12 minutes. Low-fat diets are often recommended as suitable food plans for those seeking to reduce their risk factors for cardiovascular disease. Similarly, the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) has been shown to deliver significant health benefits.

In this UniSA study, published by the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, researchers compared the health benefits of a MedDiet supplemented with two to three serves of dairy each day, and a generic low-fat diet.

The results show that the dairy-supplemented MedDiet (MedDairy) significantly improved blood pressure, heart rate, cholesterol, mood and cognitive function.

PhD candidate Alexandra Wade says the new MedDairy diet challenges popular perceptions of what is considered healthy.

“The MedDiet is fast earning a reputation as the world’s healthiest diet and is renowned for delivering improved cardiovascular and cognitive health,” Wade says.

“But it’s also higher in fat, which can be a deterrent for people seeking to adopt a healthier eating plan, especially if they don’t realise the difference between healthy and unhealthy fats.

“In Australia, low-fat diets are often recommended for improving heart health and they are still perceived as being healthy.

“This study shows that the new MedDairy works better than a generic low-fat diet, ensuring better health outcomes for people at risk of cardiovascular disease.”

Importantly, the MedDairy diet also meets additional calcium requirements recommended by Australia’s national health bodies.

A typical MedDiet includes extra virgin olive oil, fruits, vegetables, nuts, seeds, legumes, wholegrain breads, pastas and cereals, moderate consumption of fish and red wine, and low consumption of red meat, sweet and processed foods. It also includes 1-2 servings of dairy foods (700-820mg calcium), which is less than half the dairy recommended by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council (NHMRC) for older Australians.

“Living in Australia, we have different dietary requirements, notably a need for more calcium to protect against osteoporosis,” Wade says.

“These needs are unmet in the traditional MedDiet, which makes it difficult for people to adopt in the long term.

“This study delivers healthier options for Australians by tailoring the nutrients in the MedDiet to meet the needs of a non-Mediterranean population.

“In Australia, women up to age 50 years – and men up to age 70 years – should consume 1000mg per day of calcium per day and 1300mg thereafter, which is roughly between 3.5 and 4.5 serves a day.

“The new MedDairy diet allows for three to four servings with dairy, which means Australians can more sustainably meet their recommended daily nutrient intakes while also maintaining the significant health benefits offered through the MedDiet.

“When it comes down to it, people want to be able to enjoy a colourful, tasty and nutritious diet. And if you’re one of the thousands of people seeking to improve your cardiovascular and cognitive health – look no further than the MedDairy diet.”

"Newswise — LOS ANGELES (Dec. 5, 2018) - Vascular surgeon Ali Azizzadeh, MD, was the first to use a newly approved, minimally invasive device to perform a series of innovative surgeries on patients with aneurysms of the aorta, the main vessel that delivers blood from the heart to the rest of the body.

“Prior to gaining approval from the Food and Drug Administration, patients with many types of aneurysms and aortic conditions had limited treatment options,” said Azizzadeh, director of Vascular Surgery at the Smidt Heart Institute at Cedars-Sinai. “Now, patients can undergo a minimally invasive procedure to fix complex problems of the aorta without having open surgery.”

The Valiant Navion™ thoracic stent graft system is delivered from a groin blood vessel into the aorta, is positioned above the affected aneurysm, and is deployed under x-ray guidance. Compared to other technologies, the stent graft can travel through smaller, curvy vessels and better adjust to a patient’s anatomy.

Nancy Angelino, the very first patient to undergo the procedure, feels fortunate.

“This was a difficult surgery, but I knew I was in good hands,” said Angelino, 85, of Culver City. “I feel very lucky to have benefited from this new and improved surgical technique and for the great doctors who cared for me. After my recovery, I know I will feel stronger and healthier, and will remain forever grateful.”

Since Angelino’s surgery, Azizzadeh who, in conjunction with medical device company Medtronic, served as the national principal investigator in clinical tests of the device – has performed several additional, successful surgeries.

Aneurysms are weakening, or bulging, of blood vessels that can rupture and become life-threatening. Though aneurysms can happen anywhere in the body, they most commonly happen in the brain, or in the main vessels that lead to the heart, legs and arms.

Risk factors for aneurysms include heredity, smoking, high blood pressure and elevated cholesterol.",0
"Newswise — Dec. 7, 2018─Vitamin C may reduce the harm done to lungs in infants born to mothers who smoke during their pregnancy, according to a randomized, controlled trial published online in the American Thoracic Society’s American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine.

In “Oral Vitamin C (500 mg/day) to Pregnant Smokers Improves Infant Airway Function at 3 Months: A Randomized Trial,” Cindy T. McEvoy, MD, MCR, and her co-authors report that at three months of age, the infants whose mothers took 500 mg of vitamin C in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows (FEFs). FEFs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction.

The researchers also discovered an association between the infant FEFs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born. Other studies have linked this genetic factor, specifically for the α5 nicotinic acetylcholine receptor, to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease.

“Smoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations,” said Dr. McEvoy, lead study author and professor of pediatrics at Oregon Health & Science University. “Finding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised, addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed.”

In a previous study, the authors had shown that 72 hours after birth, babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin C (500 mg/day) during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo. That study used passive methods to measure lung function, and the authors note that FEFs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children.

In the current study, 251 pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at 13 to 23 weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin C (125 women) or a placebo (126 women). Smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week. All participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study, and about 10 percent of the women quit smoking during the study.

The researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid, a component of vitamin C, available to the body. At the time they enrolled in the study, the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke. Those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin C to become comparable to women who do not smoke.

Infants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes. The authors believe that future trials of vitamin C supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves.

Summing up the findings of the current study, Dr. McEvoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin C may present “a safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide.”

However, she added, helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials. “Although vitamin C supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy, those children will still be at greater risk for obesity, behavioral disorders and other serious health issues,” she said.

This study was funded by the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute and the Office of Dietary Supplements.

"Newswise — Boston, Mass – Physicians at Massachusetts Eye and Ear have, for the first time, induced a sense of smell in humans by using electrodes in the nose to stimulate nerves in the olfactory bulb, a structure in the brain where smell information from the nose is processed and sent to deeper regions of brain. Reporting online today in International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology, the research team describes their results, which provide a proof of concept for efforts to develop implant technology to return the sense of smell to those who have lost it.

“Our work shows that smell restoration technology is an idea worth studying further,” said corresponding author Eric Holbrook, MD, Chief of Rhinology at Mass. Eye and Ear and associate professor of otolaryngology at Harvard Medical School. “The development of cochlear implants, for example, didn’t really accelerate until someone placed an electrode in the cochlea of a patient and found that the patient heard a frequency of some type.”

Smell loss, or anosmia, has an estimated prevalence of 5 percent of the general population. While some cases of anosmia may be treated by caring for an underlying cause (often nasal obstruction, in which odors can’t reach the nerves of the olfactory system due to swelling, polyps or sinus disease), other cases involving damage to the sensory nerves of the nose (i.e. head injury, viruses and aging) are much more complex. There are currently no proven therapies for these cases.

Our sense of smell not only contributes to our enjoyment of life, but also to our daily safety and well being. We rely on our sense of smell to make us aware of smoke in detecting a fire, natural gas leaks and to avoid eating rotten food. In the elderly, of whom there are estimates that greater than 50 percent of the population over the age of 65 has experienced smell loss, it can be difficult to get proper nutrition, as the sensation of flavor is closely tied to the sense of smell, and as flavor diminishes, appetite decreases in this population.

A Cochlear Implant for the Nose

Motivated by work conducted by research colleagues at Virginia Commonwealth University’s School of Medicine, Mass. Eye and Ear physicians wanted to address the question of whether electrical stimulation of the olfactory bulb could induce the sense of smell in human subjects.

The findings described in the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology report demonstrate this feasibility. In the report, the researchers describe endoscopic procedures to position electrodes in the sinus cavities of five patients with an intact ability to smell. Three patients described sensations of smell (including reports of onions, antiseptic, sour and fruity aromas) as a result of the stimulation.

This breakthrough in human patients opens the door for a “cochlear implant for the nose” to be developed — though the study authors caution that the concept of an olfactory stimulator is more challenging than existing technologies. The most successful neuroprosthesic device in the world, cochlear implants have been on the market for more than three decades to electrically stimulate the auditory nerve to restore hearing in people with profound hearing loss.

“There’s currently so little that we can do for these patients, and we hope to eventually be able to reestablish smell in people who don’t have a sense of smell,” Dr. Holbrook said. “Now we know that electrical impulses to the olfactory bulb can provide a sense of smell — and that’s encouraging.”

In addition to Dr. Holbrook, authors on the International Forum of Allergy & Rhinology study include co-first author Sidharth V. Puram, MD, PhD, of Washington University School of Medicine, Reiner B. See, MD, and Aaron G. Tripp, of Massachusetts General Hospital, and Dinesh G. Nair, MD, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

"Newswise — HOUSTON – (Nov. 8, 2018) A small clinical trial using gold nanoparticles that act as tumor-seeking missiles on a mission to remove prostate cancer has begun at The University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston (UTHealth). It is the first trial of its kind in the world.

The nanoparticles, or nanoshells, are made of small layers of silica glass formed into a sphere and wrapped in a thin layer of gold. The shells seek out and saturate cancerous cells, and their advanced vibrational properties are then harnessed to cause the tumorous tissue to pulse with extreme temperature when light is applied through a laser specifically designed to excite the particles. The oscillation kills the cancer cells while preserving the healthy tissue, avoiding the nerves and urinary sphincter. This procedure is the first in the world that is precise enough to potentially avoid negative ramifications like urinary incontinence or sexual impotency.

“This therapy could be life-changing for men diagnosed with prostate cancer and I’m honored to be among the first doctors the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved to put it to the test,” said Steven Canfield, M.D., chair of the division of urology at McGovern Medical School at UTHealth, who recognized the possibility of the nanoparticles to treat prostate cancer and helped developed the trial to test the theory.

Prostate cancer begins when cells in a man’s prostate gland mutate and start to grow uncontrollably. Other than skin cancer, prostate is the most common cancer in American men, with an estimated 1 out of 9 men diagnosed. The American Cancer Society estimates 29,430 men died from the disease in 2018 alone.

Treatment options have traditionally included radical prostatectomy, which is the removal of the prostate gland and some of the tissue around it, radiation therapy and cryotherapy, among others. These methods carry the potential to have a negative impact on urinary function and sexual performance.

“The side effects of current prostate cancer treatments can be extremely traumatic. This new technology holds the potential to eliminate those life-altering effects, while still removing the cancer tissue and reducing hospital and recovery time,” Canfield said. “In fact, the first patient in the trial was actually riding a bike within a week of his treatment. The fusion of MRI and ultrasound imaging technology that we use to accurately identify and diagnose the cancer, combined with the extreme precision of the gold nanoshells in targeting the diseased cells, allows us to be incredibly accurate at obliterating them. I am excited as we continue tracking the progress of this groundbreaking improvement to prostate cancer care.”

Doug Flewellen, the first patient in Texas to receive the new method of care, says for him, the procedure was a no-brainer.

“No man wants to go through radical removal, and I knew active monitoring could have potentially aggravated the cancer,” Flewellen said. “The side effects of traditional treatment were not worth it to me, and I wasn’t afraid to try the most cutting-edge technology. Looking back, the experience was even better than I was expecting, and I hope to see nanoparticle therapy advance into an option for anyone diagnosed with prostate cancer in the future.”

The gold nanoparticles were invented by Naomi Halas, the head of Rice University’s Laboratory for Nanophotonics. Canfield worked closely with Halas and Nanospectra Biosciences, the company where the shells are licensed, to incorporate the state-of-the-art technology into the trial that is also underway at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai and the University of Michigan to test the efficacy of the therapy.

"Newswise — HOUSTON ― For the first time, transplanting gut bacteria from healthy donors was used to successfully treat patients suffering from severe colitis caused by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors (ICIs). The study from The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, which includes two patients, suggests fecal microbiota transplantation (FMT) is worth investigating in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy.

The research, led by Yinghong Wang, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Gastroenterology, Hepatology & Nutrition and director of Medication Induced Colitis and Enteritis, was published today in Nature Medicine.

“The resolution of colitis in these patients can be confirmed clinically and endoscopically after FMT treatment,” said Wang. “Based on these results, this should be evaluated even as a first-line therapy for ICI-associated colitis because it’s safe, quick, and the effect is durable - from one treatment.”

Immune checkpoint inhibitors, which release a block on the immune system to attack cancer, have been successful in providing durable responses for patients with several cancer types. However, these treatments are often associated with significant immune-related toxicities.

Colitis, inflammation of the colon, is the second most common side effect from ICIs, occurring in up to 40 percent of patients, explained Wang. When ICI-associated colitis is severe, guidelines require a patient to stop ICI treatment until the colitis is in remission.

“If the patient is a good responder to immunotherapy, that means you’ve taken their effective treatment away,” said Wang. “We have a limited amount of time to fix the problem so they can resume ICI treatment, but I feel that we’ve made great progress in this area.”

The researchers chose to investigate the potential for FMT as an alternative, compassionate-use therapy for patients suffering from refractory, or unresponsive, ICI-associated colitis. The two patients included in the study were treated at MD Anderson between June 2017 and January 2018.

FMT has shown promise in treating other types of gastrointestinal diseases, such as recurrent Clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which shares many clinical and molecular characteristics with ICI-associated colitis. These conditions typically are treated with steroids and targeted immunosuppressive agents, which result in additional severe side effects and can counteract the effects of immunotherapy.

Both patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with FMT. The first patient’s colitis resolved within two weeks following a single FMT treatment; the second patient experienced a partial recovery after the first treatment, followed by complete recovery after a second FMT. With endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment, both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations, including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells.

Pre- and post-treatment stool analyses revealed patients’ gut microbiomes to be most similar to the donor immediately after treatment, with less resemblance to the donor over time. Still, post-treatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pre-treatment microbiome. Additionally, distinct new populations of bacterial species were evident in these patients following FMT compared to pre-treatment samples, including several species known to be protective or reduce inflammation.

The authors acknowledge significant limitations to this study based on the very small cohort, and they plan to pursue clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of FMT in treating ICI-associated colitis as compared with standard immunosuppressive therapy. FMT continues to be offered to MD Anderson patients on a compassionate-use basis.

Previous MD Anderson research showed that bacteria in the gut influence patient response to ICI therapy, and other evidence suggests modifying the microbiome in mice can alter their response to immunotherapy. The current data further suggests there is the potential for many molecular studies to better understand the role of the microbiome in driving ICI-colitis and immunotherapy response more broadly.

The study was supported by the Andrew Sabin Family Fellowship Program; the American Association for Cancer Research – Stand Up to Cancer; the National Institutes of Health (CA219896-01A1, HL124112); the Cancer Prevention & Research Institute of Texas; and the Melanoma Moon Shot™, part of MD Anderson’s Moon Shots Program™, a collaborative effort to accelerate the development of scientific discoveries into clinical advances that save patients’ lives

"Newswise — Baltimore, Md. Oct. 8, 2018 – The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) is now offering deep-tissue external thermal therapy in combination with high-precision proton-beam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients. MPTC is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility, an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other.

Research has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficult-to-reach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region. Studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients. External thermal therapy, or hyperthermia – in the range of 104° up to 110° F. – sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy. In addition, heat has been shown to enhance anti-tumor immune response.

“We are very pleased to be able to offer deep-tissue thermal therapy, which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as proton-beam therapy to enhance the cancer-killing effects of the radiation,” says Zeljko Vujaskovic, MD, PhD, a professor of radiation oncology and director of the Division of Translational Radiation Sciences (DTRS) in the Department of Radiation Oncology at the University of Maryland School of Medicine (UMSOM).

“Early research suggests that adding thermal therapy to proton-beam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy, and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients,” says Dr. Vujaskovic, an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology.

Proton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue. MPTC – which is affiliated with the University of Maryland Marlene and Stewart Greenebaum Comprehensive Cancer Center (UMGCCC) at the University of Maryland Medical Center – is the only proton treatment center in Maryland.

Radiation oncologists at UMGCCC already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers, but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body.

According to Dr. Vujaskovic, the new deep-tissue thermal therapy equipment, which is made by Pyrexar, will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region, including cancer of the bladder, rectum, cervix, ovaries, pancreas and connective tissue, which are known as sarcomas. Patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard (photon) radiation or proton-beam therapy.

The system heats the tumor tissue to 108° F. with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature. A water-filled applicator is placed over the area to be treated, and non-invasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor. The heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate, bringing more oxygen into the tumor, which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy.

The acquisition of the deep-tissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from Jack and Emily Howell and the Middendorf Foundation, Inc.

“Within the Department of Radiation Oncology and throughout our cancer center, we strive to make every available tool in the cancer-fighting toolbox available to our patients,” says William F. Regine, MD, FACR, FACRO, the Isadore & Fannie Schneider Foxman Endowed Chair and Professor of radiation oncology at UMSOM and chair of radiation oncology at UMGCCC. “By continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program, we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for better outcomes.”

“The Maryland Proton Treatment Center has achieved another milestone by becoming the first center to offer both deep-thermal therapy and proton therapy,” says E. Albert Reece, MD, PhD, MBA, Executive Vice President for Medical Affairs at UM Baltimore and the John Z. and Akiko K. Bowers Distinguished Professor and dean at UMSOM. “This achievement is a testament to Dr. Vujaskovic’s considerable expertise in hyperthermic oncology and leadership in developing an outstanding thermal oncology program at the University of Maryland. It’s this type of innovation that sets MPTC apart from other proton treatment centers.”

About the Maryland Proton Treatment Center

The Maryland Proton Treatment Center (MPTC) offers proton therapy – a highly advanced and precise form of radiation therapy that can increase radiation dose to tumor while decreasing dose to healthy, surrounding tissue – to the Baltimore/Washington region and beyond. It is a highly effective treatment for a wide range of localized tumors such as those found in the brain, base of the skull, head and neck area, eye tumors, tumors of the esophagus, lung, prostate, liver, breast, spinal cord, as well as gastrointestinal malignancies. It is also an important treatment option for children with cancer.

At MPTC, each treatment room is equipped with the most advanced form of “pencil beam” proton therapy, which essentially paints the radiation onto the tumor while stopping precisely at the site of the tumor. Proton therapy is performed on an outpatient basis and is a well-tolerated, non-invasive treatment that can reduce side effects. It can be used in conjunction with other modalities of cancer treatments such as chemotherapy and surgery. MPTC offers a robust clinical trial program to all its patients to further evidence-based medicine.",0
"Evivo's quick and non-invasive test measures the presence of markers that indicate low or high levels of good Bifidobacterium , such as acetate and lactate. A stool sample containing high levels of these markers will be strong enough to change the test's liquid display from pink to yellow, indicating high levels of Bifidobacterium. The liquid will remain pink if a sample has low levels of acetate and lactate, indicating that Bifidobacterium is missing and that key nutrients from breast milk, human milk oligosaccharides (HMO), are being wasted. Evivo has commenced rigorous clinical trials with the prototype to demonstrate the results from infant stool samples.

Point-of-Care Diagnostic Expert Turns Focus to the Infant Gut

The development of the prototype is led by Dr. Bethany Henrick, Ph.D., Director of Immunology and Diagnostics for Evivo. With more than a decade of experience designing and creating rapid, point-of-care diagnostics, Henrick was formerly an integral part of the team that developed and optimized the world's fastest point-of-care HIV test in 2005.

""This is the first and only point-of-care screening test designed to identify infants that do not have enough Bifidobacterium levels to create a stable infant gut microbiome,"" said Dr. Henrick. ""With recent research indicating most babies born after 1980 do not acquire Bifidobacterium at birth, our ability to detect significant levels of Bifidobacterium gives pediatricians and parents an immediate indication of whether or not their baby has this beneficial gut bacteria that set them up for lifelong health.""

Identifying a Disappearing, Yet Critical Piece of Gut Health

Dr. Henrick's previously published findings, which are the basis for the Evivo test, show an inverse correlation between rising infant fecal pH, reduced acetate and lactate, and lower levels of beneficial Bifidobacterium, proving that the infant gut microbiome has been rapidly changing over the last three generations. In the past, babies acquired Bifidobacterium from their mother during childbirth, but due to the increased use of modern medical practices such as antibiotics, C-sections and formula feeding, nine out of 10 babies born in the U.S. today no longer acquire it. The generational loss of this good bacteria in the infant gut allows for potentially harmful bacteria such as E. Coli and Clostridia to thrive, which are linked to higher risk of short- and long-term health issues such as colic, eczema, allergies, diabetes, and obesity.

""Currently there is no way to easily determine whether a baby is colonized with healthy bacteria,"" said Mark Underwood, M.D., Chief of Neonatology at UC Davis Medical Center. ""The ability to quickly measure levels of Bifidobacterium in a stool sample would enable pediatricians to identify babies with low levels of these beneficial bacteria and take appropriate action.""

Evolve BioSystems' Evivo is the only baby probiotic clinically proven to restore Bifidobacterium to a baby's gut and reduce potentially harmful bacteria by 80 percent. In a landmark clinical trial, Evivo produced rapid, substantial and persistent stabilization of the infant gut microbiome, to help set a foundation for life-long health.

"REHOVOT, Israel, Sept. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucleix Ltd., a leading cancer detection company, announced today positive results from a clinical study designed to evaluate its innovative Lung EpiCheck™, a blood test for early detection of lung cancer. The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck ™ - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada.

In the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls.

In particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients.

In the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage.

""Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,"" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. ""Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer.""

""We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,"" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. ""Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price.""

About Lung EpiCheck

The Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer.

About Lung Cancer

Lung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease – mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.

"ISNES, Belgium, Aug. 13, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- VolitionRx Limited (NYSE AMERICAN: VNRX) (""Volition"") today announced preliminary data from a prospective, multi-centered Proof of Concept Study of 84 men into the utility of Volition's Nu.Q™ assays to diagnose men with high-grade prostate cancer.

Volition panel PSA alone 94% 33%

At 88% specificity, the Volition panel of five assays (including PSA) identified 94% of high-grade prostate cancers that require treatment (as defined by Gleason Score1). This compares with just 33% identified by Prostate-Specific Antigen (PSA) alone.

""This is a very exciting outcome for us as we continue the development of our assays beyond colorectal cancer. The preliminary data from this study showed that Volition's panel of assays identified men with potentially lethal high-grade prostate cancer with much greater accuracy than PSA alone. Based on this data, we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with low-grade tumors or no tumor. The next step is to confirm these statistically significant findings in independent larger clinical trials"" said Dr. Jake Micallef, Chief Scientific Officer at Volition.

Prostate cancer (PCA) is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the U.S. after lung cancer2. Currently, PCA is diagnosed through medical history, physical examination and by elevated levels of PSA in the blood. Men suspected of PCA are given a prostate biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer. However, most men with elevated PSA levels referred for prostate biopsy either have no cancer or have low-grade cancer which needs monitoring but not treatment.

In the Proof of Concept Study, a blood sample was taken prospectively from men referred for prostate biopsy in three Belgian hospitals. The men were grouped by biopsy findings as having no cancer (most of whom had elevated PSA levels), low-grade cancer or high-grade cancer. The samples were tested with a panel of five assays (PSA, two Nu.Q™ assays and two inflammatory biomarkers).

The assay results correlated with the Gleason Score, which is one of the main predictors for aggressive PCA determined on biopsy. This suggests the assays may provide better risk stratification than that available using PSA tests for men with actual or suspected PCA, leading to better patient management and fewer unnecessary biopsies.

Commenting on the results, Principal Investigator, Professor Thierry Roumeguere, Head of Urological Services, Erasme Hospital, Brussels, Belgium said ""A non-invasive test to help in the risk stratification of men with suspected or actual prostate cancer will be a major step forward in the management of this disease. The correlation of the panel blood test results with Gleason Score shows great promise in this regard. We will further investigate the data in relation to disease stage as well as additional factors used for pre-treatment risk stratification.""

Cameron Reynolds, Chief Executive Officer at Volition commented ""This small trial is important because it helps demonstrate once more the potential breadth of our technology. If these results are validated in larger trials, they will present a potentially significant new market opportunity. Volition's research team is continuing to develop our Nu.Q™ assays and we aim to launch products in 2019.""

Dr. Gaetan Michel, Chief Executive Officer of Volition's wholly-owned subsidiary, Belgian Volition SPRL, commented, ""We would like to thank the Walloon Region for their continued support of the company. The funding provided by the region has enabled this study and will support our continued research.""

"IRVINE, Calif., Aug. 2, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- MDxHealth SA (OTC: MDXHF.BR) today announces that a new study validates the cost-effectiveness of the SelectMDx® for Prostate Cancer test, a non-invasive, urine-based (liquid biopsy) test that helps identify patients at increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer. The SelectMDx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy.

The study published in The Journal of Urology, led by researchers at the Vanderbilt University Medical Center, was designed to elucidate the cost-effectiveness of SelectMDx in a population of U.S. men with elevated PSA, a marker of prostate cancer risk. Researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the non-invasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy. The primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes, measured in quality-adjusted life years, and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs.

The researchers found that incorporating SelectMDx resulted in an average gain of 0.045 life years, or approximately 16 days, in full health gained at a cost-savings of $1,694 for each patient undergoing biopsy. Extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of 311,879 patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in 14,035 life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than $500 million for each cohort.

""This study demonstrated that routine use of SelectMDx to guide biopsy decision-making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of U.S. men,"" said Dr. Matthew Resnick from the departments of Urologic Surgery and Health Policy at Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Nashville, TN. ""We believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost, the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation.""

Every year, 1.3 million men in the U.S. undergo a prostate biopsy.i Although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer, the procedure is invasive and results in complications in 18 percent of patients, with 3 percent hospitalized for infection within 30 days.ii,iii,iv Common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding, infection, sepsis/bacteremia, urinary symptoms/retention, and sexual dysfunction.

""While biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis, no man wants to, nor should have to, go through the uncomfortable, costly procedure if it can be avoided,"" said Dr. Jan Groen, Chief Executive Officer of MDxHealth. ""We developed SelectMDx to help reduce unnecessary biopsies and now we have the data to show how we can both improve outcomes and save the system money.""

The full paper is accessible via the online edition of The Journal of Urology.

"Results are published in the scientific publication the Journal of Medical Cases, and is authored by USRM Chief Science Officer Dr. Kristin Comella and colleagues Dr. Scott Greenberg of the Magaziner Center for Wellness, and Dr. Laura Ross of Ross Orthopedic.

""The ability to provide this kind of therapy to Americans can be life changing,"" said Dr. Comella. ""Use of one's own healing cells to help repair damaged tissue rather than having to cut open or manipulate the damaged area to try to reduce pain and restore function is the most elegant form of regenerative medicine we have today.""

Meniscal injuries are the most common knee injury in the United States with an annual average of incidence of 66 per 100,000, according to a 2014 article in the Journal of Orthopedics. Approximately 850,000 patients each year are surgically treated -- often arthroscopically -- for meniscal injuries.

The paper outlines the case study of a 56-year-old male with a chronic meniscus injury. During the 12-month follow-up period, the patient reported a reduction in pain and an improvement in knee function. Figure 1a shows a tear at baseline on the posterior horn of the medial meniscus, while Figure 1b, taken 9 months after the first injection shows complete resolution of the tear. The healed tear could not be penetrated by the probe.

The arthroscopic images showing resolution were also consistent with quality of life improvements for the patient, including a reduction in pain and resumption of normal activities. The patient experienced very little downtime and was able to resume normal activities in less than 1 week.

Dr. Comella, who has more than 20+ years' experience, is recognized worldwide by her peers as an innovator and world leader in the development and clinical practice of stem cell products and therapies. USRM has been a part of more than 10,000 stem cell procedures in the past 19 years for a variety of indications including orthopedic, autoimmune, degenerative and neurological diseases.

U.S. Stem Cell, Inc. is an emerging leader in the regenerative medicine / cellular therapy industry specializing in physician training and certification and stem cell products including its lead product Adipocell™, as well as veterinary stem cell training and stem cell banking and creation and management of stem cell clinics.

"NEW YORK and SAN DIEGO, June 28, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- An international team of researchers from Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSK), Epic Sciences, The Institute of Cancer Research, UK, and London Health Sciences Centre, Canada, have shown that a blood test can identify patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) who may live longer if they switch from targeted androgen receptor-signaling inhibitor (ARSi) therapy, such as enzalutamide and abiraterone, to taxane-based chemotherapy. This independent, multicenter, blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit. The blood test called, Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ is commercially available in the U.S. through Epic Science's partnership with Genomic Health, Inc. (NASDAQ: GHDX). The research was published online today in JAMA Oncology.

""This liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient's life,"" said Howard Scher, M.D., who led the study and is the co-chair, Center for Mechanism Based Therapy and Head of the Biomarker Development Initiative at MSK. ""During the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer, physicians will now be able to use AR-V7 status to determine when a patient's cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy, enabling the patient to live longer.""

This blinded four-year study followed 142 mCRPC patients who were treated at MSK, The Royal Marsden, or the London Health Sciences Centre. Blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with ARSi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear-localized androgen receptor splice variant (AR-V7) protein in circulating tumor cells. The results were that patients positive for AR-V7 who were treated with taxane-based chemotherapy had superior overall survival (OS) relative to those treated with ARSI therapy (median OS, 14.3 vs. 7.3 months). Importantly, patients negative for AR-V7 who were treated with ARSi therapy had superior OS relative to those treated with taxanes (media OS, 19.8 vs. 12.8 months). Additionally, the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group, to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables.

""We developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer: which treatment should be pursued next? This question weighs heavily on doctors and patients, but now, with the Oncotype DX AR-V7 test, we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes,"" said Ryan Dittamore, chief of medical innovation at Epic Sciences and a co-author on the study. ""In addition, the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our AR-V7 test could make the test as valuable to a patient's outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug.""

This is the second blinded, multi-center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear-localized AR-V7 test. Earlier this month, Dr. Andrew Armstrong of Duke Cancer Institute presented data validating the test in the PROPHECY clinical trial at the ASCO 2018 Annual Meeting. The PROPHECY study investigated the AR-V7 test in patients receiving ARSi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from ARSi therapy.

In March of this year, based upon earlier studies utilizing the test, Palmetto GBA, a Medicare Administrative Contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies, issued a draft local coverage determination (LCD) for the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test. A full LCD for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support Medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering ARSI or taxane therapies. It is estimated that 50,000 patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test.

The paper is entitled, ""Assessment of the Validity of Nuclear-Localized Androgen Receptor Splice Variant 7 in Circulating Tumor Cells as a Predictive Biomarker for Castration-Resistant Prostate Cancer.""

About the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ Test

Designed by Epic Sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, the Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC) by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment. Through a blood draw, the test detects AR-V7 protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing Epic Sciences' No Cell Left Behind® platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor (AR)-targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy. The Oncotype DX® AR-V7 Nucleus Detect™ test will be performed by Epic Sciences at its centralized, CLIA-certified laboratory in San Diego and offered exclusively by Genomic Health.

"Chordoma is a cancer that occurs in the bones of the spine, sacrum and skull base. Only about 300 Americans are diagnosed with this cancer each year. The tumors can be complex to treat because they are located along the spinal cord, nerves and arteries. Chordomas are part of a group of tumors called sarcomas. While slow growing, they can be aggressive.

Life-threatening tumor

Blindsided by the news his tailbone pain was caused by a life-threatening tumor, Tracy sought information and opinions. His doctor referred him to specialists at a major medical center in San Francisco. He learned surgery is the most common treatment. But, a surgeon told Tracy and wife, Karin Rittenberg, he should prepare for possible complications.

Said Tracy, ""We were told that I should prepare myself for the loss of functionality below the waist – including bowel, bladder and sexual functions. Even with surgery, there was a high risk of recurrence. That's when we began to research other options, such as radiation therapy.""

Treatment options

The couple then met with a radiation oncologist. The doctor explained in cases where surgery is not an option or the outcome of surgery was unacceptable, people turn to definitive radiation therapy. He provided Tracy and Karin with a copy of a published research paper on chordoma and the effects of definitive radiation. The lead author and researcher was Dr. Peyman Kabolizadeh, clinical director, Beaumont Proton Therapy Center in Royal Oak. While the findings were written for health care professionals and very technical, Tracy was encouraged.

""Definitive radiation therapy refers to curative radiation,"" explained Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Radiation is the only treatment the patient receives."" In his study published in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, he and his colleagues found, ""in circumstances where surgery may result in significant neurologic or organ dysfunction, patients can be treated definitively with radiation therapy alone. The results supported the use of high-dose definitive radiation therapy, via proton beam therapy, for selected patients with unresected spine and sacral chordomas.""

The San Francisco radiation oncologist not only shared Dr. Kabolizadeh's research paper, but also his contact information. Both Tracy and Karin learned about the differences between photon and proton radiation. They did their homework on treatment options, but for Tracy it became quite frustrating. Karin persisted in her fact-finding, when Tracy was down emotionally.

""You have to understand, because this cancer is so rare, there is limited research available,"" Tracy said. ""That was the truly scary part about making any decisions.""

Second, third and more opinions

They conferred with Dr. Kabolizadeh at Beaumont in Michigan by telephone. The couple also traveled to a highly-regarded cancer center in New York City.

""It seemed everyone I spoke with had a different opinion,"" said Tracy. ""I then determined, definitive radiation therapy was the way to go, but I had to decide which type and where. There was photon therapy available in San Francisco, but, in my research, I found out the photon beams don't stop at the tumor and have a greater possibility of affecting surrounding organs, too. I liked what I heard about the advantages of proton beams precisely targeting the tumor and stopping, sparing nearby tissue from harmful radiation.""

Deciding on proton therapy

Several factors went into Tracy's decision to choose proton therapy at Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak. Not only were he and Karin impressed with the advanced cancer killing capabilities of the pencil beam proton therapy, but also with the expertise of Dr. Kabolizadeh.

""I looked at survivability, length of life and quality of life. Right now, I'm living life to the fullest and have a beautiful wife. We travel, entertain friends and are diehard Giants fans,"" explained Tracy. ""Beaumont has the most advanced equipment, and someone who is familiar with treatments for my rare cancer. I felt that gave me the best chance of success. Dr. Kabolizadeh has the vehicle and knows how to drive it! Every time we spoke, he was honest, open and candid. His candor was refreshing.""

About 3 months after his cancer diagnosis, Tracy traveled to Royal Oak in late January to begin his proton treatments. On Tuesday, April 3, he completed his nine weeks of treatment.

He not only looks forward to watching his beloved Giants at AT&T Park, but hanging out with his dog Neyo. And Karin looks forward to him shaving the ""treatment beard"" he has been growing since his treatments began.

Beaumont proton team 'second to none'

""I realize I'm extremely fortunate to have been able to consider traveling to another state for treatment and live there for two and a half months,"" said Tracy. ""I'm also fortunate that Karin's company has been supportive of her working remotely so she could stay with me. And I'm so grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support we've received from our family and friends during our stay in Michigan. That helped keep our spirits high.""

And when asked about his treatment experience, Tracy remarked, ""Every single person that I've engaged with at Beaumont has been a delight. They all made what could have been a difficult experience tolerable. The facilities are impressive, clean and welcoming, but the difference is the people – best hospital staff I've ever encountered. The team in the Proton Therapy Center is second to none.""

About Beaumont's Proton Therapy Center

Beaumont's center is one of just 28 proton therapy centers in the U.S. It is the only operational proton therapy center in Michigan.

How proton therapy works

Proton therapy is a high-tech alternative to X-ray radiation. A scanning beam of proton radiation with online image guidance offers greater precision to destroy cancerous cells, sparing adjacent healthy tissue with fewer side effects.

Proton therapy uses positively charged atomic particles, traveling up to two-thirds the speed of light, to fight cancer. A cyclotron, or particle accelerator, creates protons from hydrogen molecules. The proton beam is sent to the treatment room through a transport system consisting of magnets, called the beam line, finally arriving in the gantry, a device that rotates around the patient. The beam is directed to the patient through a nozzle that targets the tumor.

While proton therapy is not effective against all cancers, it is effective in treating many solid and localized tumors.

Advanced technology

""Our IBA ProteusOne single-room treatment system includes precision technologies,"" said Dr. Kabolizadeh. ""Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy, which combines Pencil Beam Scanning and 3-D Cone Beam CT, can target a tumor within less than a millimeter.""

Pencil Beam Scanning refers to the delivery of protons in a thin beam. Like a pencil, the beam uses back and forth motions to target the treatment area – the shape, size and depth. It ""paints"" a radiation dose on tumors layer by layer. Compared to X-ray beams, which pass through a patient, proton beams deliver targeted radiation to the tumor and then stop – resulting in no exit dose.

Radiation oncologists at Beaumont are well versed in precise image guidance, having developed cone beam CT technology almost 20 years ago.

Dr. Kabolizadeh explained, ""Image guidance allows doctors to visualize tumors during therapy to assess response and make sure the tumor is treated correctly every day.""

Comprehensive cancer care

Proton therapy is an important addition to Beaumont's comprehensive arsenal of leading-edge cancer treatments. Beaumont's Radiation Oncology department is ranked among the nation's best for advanced technology, innovative treatment and research. Advanced radiation treatments developed at Beaumont include adaptive radiation therapy, image-guided radiation therapy, intensity-modulated arc therapy, high-dose rate brachytherapy and hyperthermia therapy.

"TITUSVILLE, N.J., June 14, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced results from the MERCURY PE study, which showed that people with low-risk pulmonary embolism (PE) treated with XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) and discharged from the emergency department had significantly reduced time in the hospital and a median savings of $2,496 in per patient costs, compared to standard of care in-patient treatment. Results from MERCURY PE, which evaluated the benefits of treating patients with low-risk PE with XARELTO® and discharging them early from the emergency department to complete treatment at home, were published in Academic Emergency Medicine.

Click to Tweet: New study shows out-patient use of Janssen #bloodthinner results in cost savings and reduces time in hospital for low-risk PE patients https://ctt.ac/RZ2ka+

""Every year, U.S. health care systems spend more than two billion dollars to manage patients with pulmonary emboli,"" said principal study investigator W. Frank Peacock, MD, FACEP, FACC, Associate Chair and Research Director, Emergency Medicine, Baylor College of Medicine, Houston, TX. ""By avoiding hospitalizations that are not clinically necessary and transitioning patients with low-risk PE to out-patient treatment with XARELTO®, we've seen significant cost savings, which could help alleviate the burden on health care systems.""



Venous thromboembolism (VTE) includes deep vein thrombosis (DVT), a blood clot in a deep vein, and PE, a potentially life-threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot travels to the lung. Of the approximately 900,000 Americans who experience a VTE each yeari, more than 250,000 are diagnosed with PE in the emergency departmentii. Hospitals across the United States have varying protocols for managing PE, but standard of care typically requires people to be admitted for treatment, which drives up costs and substantially increases hospital-acquired conditions and infectionsiii,iv. While people with more severe PE have higher mortality rates, the 30-day mortality rate of low-risk PE is less than one percentv.

MERCURY PE met its primary efficacy endpoint, with XARELTO® leading to significantly reduced time in the hospital due to VTE or bleeding within 30 days after randomization compared with the standard of care (mean duration of 4.8 vs. 33.6 hours, respectively; 95% CI; p<0.0001). The mean difference of length of stay between the two groups was 28.8 hours. Of note, there was no recurrence of VTE or VTE-related death or any significant differences in the bleeding-related hospitalizations or physician visits within 90 days from randomization in either group, though this outcome should be interpreted with caution, as the study was significantly underpowered to detect any such differences.

""We're proud to have pioneered this groundbreaking research, which was the first prospective randomized trial to confirm the benefit of discharging patients with low-risk PE early from the hospital and completing treatment at home,"" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Janssen Scientific Affairs, LLC. ""We expect that this XARELTO® study will prompt physicians to reconsider how patients with low-risk PE are managed.""

About MERCURY-PE

Patients with low-risk PE were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to open label XARELTO® or standard of care within 12 hours of diagnosis. Patients randomized to XARELTO® were discharged from the emergency department within 24 hours and were instructed to take XARELTO® 15 mg twice daily for 21 days, then XARELTO® 20 mg once daily until the study was completed. Patients randomized to standard of care were treated per local hospital protocol, which could include hospitalization and any U.S. Food and Drug Administration-approved anticoagulant strategy, including XARELTO®.

Researchers also made the following observations about XARELTO® in this setting:

The mean length of initial and subsequent hospitalizations for any reason was shorter for patients who were discharged early on XARELTO ® within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively).

within 90 days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care (p=0.024; 19.2 hours vs. 43.2 hours, respectively). There was no major bleeding in either group within 90 days from randomization, although two patients reported clinically relevant non-major bleeding, one in each group. There were no deaths due to bleeding in the study.

Overall, early discharge on XARELTO® was markedly less expensive than standard of care. The cost associated with the emergency room visit and any subsequent hospitalization at the time of PE diagnosis and the total costs were $2,638 (p<0.001) and $2,496 (p<0.001) less with XARELTO®.

MERCURY PE builds on prior research, including a June 2015 study published in Academic Emergency Medicine showing that 106 patients with low-risk PE or DVT, when prescribed XARELTO® and immediately discharged, had no recurrent events while on therapy. Additionally, no major or clinically relevant bleeding events were observed. A companion study found patients with low-risk PE or DVT who were prescribed XARELTO® had significantly lower medical costs than those admitted and given standard treatment.

The clinical and economic benefits demonstrated in the MERCURY-PE trial have been confirmed in more than 3,100 U.S. patients in a real-world study, showing that XARELTO® resulted in a significant one-day reduction in hospital length of stay and significantly lower total healthcare costs (approximately $2,000).

MERCURY PE Patient Satisfaction Results

Patient satisfaction, both with out-patient and in-patient care, was also analyzed using Likert scales and the Anti-Clot Treatment Score (ACTS). On the Likert scales, most patients in both groups indicated they were ""very satisfied"" with their care, but numerically more patients taking XARELTO® preferred to receive outpatient care (50 percent) compared to slightly less than half of patients receiving in-patient standard of care (47.5 percent). The ACTS measured the patient's perspective on the burden of treatment, with more patients taking XARELTO® reporting it was ""not at all"" burdensome compared to those receiving standard of care (64.4 percent vs. 54.4 percent).

About MERCURY PE

MERCURY PE was a randomized, open label, parallel-group, multicenter trial conducted at 35 hospitals across the U.S. Adult patients who arrived at the emergency department with confirmed, low-risk PE (defined by the absence of any Hestia criteria) were eligible for enrollment. Of the 114 patients randomized, 99 completed the study (44 in the XARELTO® group and 55 in the standard of care group). Patients who did not complete the study were mainly lost to follow-up or adverse events. Analyses were conducted by intention-to-treat basis, regardless of the anticoagulant used.

The primary efficacy outcome was the total amount of time spent in the hospital (in hours) for VTE or bleeding events in the 30 days after randomization. Hospital readmissions for reasons unrelated to VTE were excluded. The primary safety outcome was major bleeding within 90 days. Secondary efficacy endpoints included 90-day rates of new/recurrent VTE, VTE-related death, unplanned hospital or physician office visits for VTE or bleeding, total length of initial or subsequent hospitalizations for any reason, patient-reported satisfaction, and total costs of care. A secondary safety endpoint was clinically relevant non-major bleeding based on International Society on Thrombosis and Haemostasis (ISTH) definitions.

MERCURY PE also had a few limitations, including sample size (study enrolled 114 of a planned 300 patients), exclusion bias based on subjective evaluation of hemodynamic stability and ability to adhere to protocol, and potential bias due to inability to blind patients to their admission status.

About EXPLORER

MERCURY PE is part of the EXPLORER program, which is unmatched by any oral anticoagulant in the Factor Xa inhibitor class in its size, scope and ambition. A collaborative effort between Janssen and its development partner Bayer, EXPLORER seeks to generate important clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of XARELTO® and its potential role in addressing critical unmet medical needs. A number of the studies in the program are designed to seek additional indications or expand the label for XARELTO® to benefit more patients in need of additional therapies for their cardiovascular disease. By the time of its completion, more than 275,000 patients will have participated in the EXPLORER clinical development program, other completed and ongoing clinical trials, investigative registries and non-interventional studies.

WHAT IS XARELTO®?

XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO® and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)?

For people taking XARELTO® for atrial fibrillation:

People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO® lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO®, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

Do not stop taking XARELTO® without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO® increases your risk of having a stroke.

If you have to stop taking XARELTO®, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.

XARELTO® can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO® is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO® you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.

You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO® and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:

Aspirin or aspirin-containing products



Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)



Warfarin sodium (Coumadin ® , Jantoven ® )

, Jantoven )

Any medicine that contains heparin



Clopidogrel (Plavix ® )

)

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)



Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots

Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.

Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:

Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:

Nosebleeds that happen often



Unusual bleeding from gums



Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding

Bleeding that is severe or you cannot control

Red, pink, or brown urine

Bright red or black stools (looks like tar)

Cough up blood or blood clots

Vomit blood or your vomit looks like ""coffee grounds""

Headaches, feeling dizzy or weak

Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites

Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma): People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO ® , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:

People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if: A thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine



You take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting



You have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures



You have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine

If you take XARELTO® and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), or loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence).

XARELTO® is not for people with artificial heart valves.

"PHILADELPHIA - In a finding that suggests the potential for practice change that would reduce the use of antibiotics in dermatology, researchers in the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania have found the diuretic drug spironolactone may be just as effective as antibiotics for the treatment of women's acne. The study, published this month in the Journal of Drugs and Dermatology, found patients who were originally prescribed spironolactone changed to a different drug within one year at almost the same rate as those who were prescribed antibiotics. The prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness, since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy, side effects, cost, or other factors.

Acne is one of the most common diseases in the world. It affects 85 percent of people under the age of 18, but it also regularly impacts adults. More than 50 percent of women in the United States are treated for acne between the ages of 20 and 29, while more than 35 percent are treated between the ages of 30 and 39.

Oral antibiotics are the most common systemic treatment for acne, and when combined with the large patient population, the result is that dermatologists prescribe the highest level of antibiotics per provider among all medical specialties, according to the Centers for Disease Control - a fact that contributes to concerns about increased resistance to antibiotics across all fields of medicine.

""It's clear that a safe alternative to oral antibiotics could have a huge benefit, and our data show spironolactone may be that alternative,"" said the study's lead author John S. Barbieri, MD, MBA, Dermatology chief resident at Penn. David J. Margolis, MD, PhD, a professor of Dermatology, was the study's senior author.

Spironolactone, marketed under the name aldactone, is currently approved to treat high blood pressure, heart failure, and conditions that cause people to retain fluid. It blocks the effects of male hormones like androgen, meaning it's not an option to treat acne in men. However, those same anti-hormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women. As a result, some dermatologists use it to treat female acne patients.

Researchers compared data on 6,684 women and girls taking spironolactone to 31,614 who were prescribed antibiotics. Within a year, 14.4 percent of spironolactone patients and 13.4 percent of antibiotic patients had switched to alternative treatments, suggesting each treatment was working at almost the same rate, despite the fact that tetracycline-class antibiotics are prescribed five times as frequently.

""These numbers suggest dermatologists should consider spironolactone first instead of antibiotics when it comes to women with acne,"" Barbieri said.

In addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship, Barbieri pointed to several studies showing long-term oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance, lupus, inflammatory bowel disease, and even colon and breast cancer.

""This indicates spironolactone may have a better safety profile than oral antibiotics, which is another factor that makes it such an appealing option,"" Barbieri said. He also noted spironolactone is less expensive, which may be relevant to patients with high deductibles or who are uninsured.

Spironolactone is not approved for the treatment of acne by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration despite expert opinion supporting its use, and Barbieri says the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options.

ASCO Perspective

“This is one more example of how immunotherapy is making steady gains against a number of cancers. Immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer, and now we’re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer, which historically has been very difficult to treat,” said ASCO Expert David Graham, MD, FASCO.

CHICAGO – Initial findings from a randomized phase III clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) benefit more from initial treatment with PD-L1 targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab (Tecentriq®) and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone -- 29% had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. At 12 months, cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy. This benefit was observed across all PD-L1 expressing sub-groups.

The findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the 2018 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting.

“Until now, there have been few treatment advances for squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. Our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer,” said lead study author Robert M. Jotte, MD, PhD, Medical Director and Co-Chair, USON Thoracic Committee, Rocky Mountain Cancer Centers in Denver, CO. “We used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patient’s immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy, but growing research, including this study, shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor, helping the immunotherapy treatment work better.”

Squamous NSCLC, which accounts for 25-30% of NSCLCs, is very difficult to treat. Fewer than 15% of people with advanced squamous NSCLC survive a year after diagnosis, and less than 2% survive five years.

Recent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non-squamous lung cancer. Given those findings, along with the results from this trial, a rapid change in clinical practice is expected, noted Dr. Jotte.

About the Study

The IMpower131 trial enrolled 1,021 patients with stage IV squamous NSCLC. Tumors were tested for PD-L1 expression, but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor PD-L1 expression level. Patients with EGFR or ALK gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial. The study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups. Outcomes for only two of the groups, however, are being reported in this presentation:

Atezolizumab plus chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 343 patients

Chemotherapy (carboplatin and nab-paclitaxel), 340 patients

Outcome data for the third treatment group, which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen (carboplatin and paclitaxel), are not yet available.

Key Findings

In this study, 29% of all patients, regardless of PD-L1 expression, had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death, compared with those who received chemotherapy alone. Importantly, there was a doubling of progression-free survival (PFS) benefit with this combination: at 12 months, cancer had not worsened in 24.7% patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy, compared to 12% of those receiving chemotherapy alone.

Improved progression-free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy, including those with PD-L1-negative tumors and liver metastases. Overall survival data are not yet mature.

This is the first phase III trial of an immunotherapy-based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression-free survival in advanced squamous NSCLC, according to the authors. Although the difference between treatment groups is modest, a statistically significant improvement shows that, overall, people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment, according to the authors.

Although the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone (68% vs. 57%), it had a manageable safety profile, consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies. The most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash, colitis, and low thyroid hormone.

At this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival (OS) benefit was not observed (median OS was 14 months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs. 13.9 months for chemotherapy alone). Researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year.

Next Steps

More research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy. The researchers will explore tumor PD-L1 expression and other molecular markers, such as tumor mutational burden (TMB), that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen.

This study received funding from F. Hoffmann-La Roche Ltd.

"TITUSVILLE, N.J., May 24, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- The Janssen Pharmaceutical Companies of Johnson & Johnson today announced new real-world data that showed frail patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (NVAF) experienced significantly fewer strokes and systemic emboli when treated with XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) over a two-year period compared to those taking warfarin. Specifically, long-term XARELTO® use reduced the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by 32 percent and ischemic stroke alone by 31 percent compared to warfarin, with no significant increase in major bleeding. Results from the study, which also assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dabigatran each versus warfarin, were recently published in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

Click to Tweet: New two-year real-world data show Janssen blood thinner significantly reduced stroke in frail NVAF patients #JAHA #RWE #AFib https://ctt.ac/z3t2a+

Affecting nearly six million Americans, NVAF increases a person's risk of stroke by five times and accounts for 15 to 20 percent of all strokes.i,ii Frailty is a common clinical syndrome mainly seen in older adults that makes it harder for them to recover from stressful cardiovascular events and vulnerable for poorer health outcomes. People with NVAF are four times more likely to be classified as frail than people without NVAF,iii and research has shown frail people with NVAF are less likely to receive anticoagulation than non-frail people.iv,v,vi

""There is not widespread consensus on the best way to manage frail patients with NVAF in clinical practice, which is why some patients are not treated at all and remain at high risk of having a stroke,"" said Craig Coleman, PharmD, Professor of Pharmacy Practice, University of Connecticut. ""These results show long-term rivaroxaban use reduced stroke and systemic embolism in a vulnerable patient group, without increasing the risk of major bleeding. They also give physicians important insights into a well-tolerated, effective approach to treat their frail patients with NVAF.""

In the study, researchers used U.S. Truven MarketScan claims data and identified frail patients with NVAF taking XARELTO®, apixaban, or dabigatran. Each treatment group was matched separately with warfarin users in a 1:1 ratio and followed for up to two years or until an event, insurance disenrollment or end of follow-up occurred. The primary efficacy outcome was stroke (ischemic or hemorrhagic) or systemic embolism. Major bleeding was the primary safety outcome.

Researchers made the following two-year observations:

XARELTO ® was associated with a 32 percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism (HR=0.68; 95% CI=0.49-0.95) and 31 percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone (HR=0.69; 95% CI=0.48-0.99) compared to warfarin.

had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin (HR=1.07; 95% CI=0.81-1.32). Though both apixaban and dabigatran treatment were associated with numerically fewer strokes, neither statistically significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at two years compared to warfarin (HR=0.78; 95% CI=0.46-1.35 and HR=0.94; 95% CI=0.60-1.45).

Rates of major bleeding were also evaluated for apixaban versus warfarin (HR=0.72; 95% CI=0.49-1.06) and dabigatran versus warfarin (HR=0.87; 95% CI=0.63-1.19).

""This study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive efficacy and safety profile of XARELTO® across a broad spectrum of patients with NVAF, which now includes the frail population,"" said Paul Burton, MD, PhD, FACC, Vice President, Medical Affairs, Janssen Pharmaceuticals, Inc. Real-world data like this study are critical to informing and helping physicians best treat their patients' cardiovascular diseases.""



About the Frailty Study

A total of 19,077 patients were identified using claims data from U.S. MarketScan databases from November 2011 to December 2016. These patients were new users of anticoagulant therapy with XARELTO®, apixaban, dabigatran, or warfarin, who had not been previously treated with an anticoagulant. They also had at least 12 months of continuous insurance coverage, and were considered frail. Frailty was determined using the Johns Hopkins Claims-based Frailty Indicator scoring algorithm, which weighs 21 criteria identifiable in claims data, including demographics, comorbidities, and physical and cognitive dysfunction.

Each eligible XARELTO®, apixaban, and dabigatran user was propensity score matched to a warfarin user in a 1:1 ratio, which helped minimize the presence of baseline differences between cohorts. A total of 10,754 patients were included in the retrospective study, with 2,635 taking XARELTO®, 1,392 apixaban, 1,350 dabigatran, and 5,377 warfarin. This study was supported by Bayer AG, Berlin, Germany.

Real-world data have the potential to supplement randomized controlled trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice; however, they have limitations and cannot be used as stand-alone evidence to validate the efficacy and/or safety of a treatment.



Additionally, it is possible some of the analyses within this specific study may not have been sufficiently powered based on smaller sample sizes.

About Real-World XARELTO® Research

XARELTO® is the most-studied oral Factor Xa inhibitor in the world today. More than 200,000 people have been evaluated in published real-world research since the approval of XARELTO® across all approved indications in the U.S. Post-marketing studies and registries continue to confirm the safety and efficacy of XARELTO® in routine clinical use across a broad spectrum of patients. There have been no head-to-head randomized trials directly comparing non-vitamin K antagonist oral anticoagulants.

One recent study, REVISIT-US, found XARELTO® is providing an appropriate balance of benefit and risk with respect to ischemic stroke and found a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage in routine clinical practice. These are two of the most serious types of events physicians work the hardest with their patients to avoid, given their potential for irreversible harm.

WHAT IS XARELTO®?

XARELTO® (rivaroxaban) is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with atrial fibrillation not caused by a heart valve problem. For patients currently well managed on warfarin, there is limited information on how XARELTO® and warfarin compare in reducing the risk of stroke.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to treat deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), and to reduce the risk of blood clots happening again in people who continue to be at risk for DVT or PE after receiving treatment for blood clots for at least 6 months.

XARELTO® is also a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of forming a blood clot in the legs and lungs of people who have just had knee or hip replacement surgery.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

What is the most important information I should know about XARELTO® (rivaroxaban)?

For people taking XARELTO® for atrial fibrillation:

People with atrial fibrillation (an irregular heart beat) are at an increased risk of forming a blood clot in the heart, which can travel to the brain, causing a stroke, or to other parts of the body. XARELTO® lowers your chance of having a stroke by helping to prevent clots from forming. If you stop taking XARELTO®, you may have increased risk of forming a clot in your blood.

Do not stop taking XARELTO® without talking to the doctor who prescribes it for you. Stopping XARELTO® increases your risk of having a stroke.

If you have to stop taking XARELTO®, your doctor may prescribe another blood thinner medicine to prevent a blood clot from forming.

XARELTO® can cause bleeding, which can be serious, and rarely may lead to death. This is because XARELTO® is a blood thinner medicine (anticoagulant) that reduces blood clotting. While you take XARELTO® you are likely to bruise more easily, and it may take longer for bleeding to stop.

You may have a higher risk of bleeding if you take XARELTO® and take other medicines that increase your risk of bleeding, including:

Aspirin or aspirin-containing products



Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs)



Warfarin sodium (Coumadin ® , Jantoven ® )

, Jantoven )

Any medicine that contains heparin



Clopidogrel (Plavix ® )

)

Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) or serotonin norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs)



Other medicines to prevent or treat blood clots

Tell your doctor if you take any of these medicines. Ask your doctor or pharmacist if you are not sure if your medicine is one listed above.

Call your doctor or get medical help right away if you develop any of these signs or symptoms of bleeding:

Unexpected bleeding or bleeding that lasts a long time, such as:

Nosebleeds that happen often



Unusual bleeding from gums



Menstrual bleeding that is heavier than normal, or vaginal bleeding

Bleeding that is severe or you cannot control

Red, pink, or brown urine

Bright red or black stools (looks like tar)

Cough up blood or blood clots

Vomit blood or your vomit looks like ""coffee grounds""

Headaches, feeling dizzy or weak

Pain, swelling, or new drainage at wound sites

Spinal or epidural blood clots (hematoma): People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO ® , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if:

People who take a blood thinner medicine like XARELTO , and have medicine injected into their spinal and epidural area, or have a spinal puncture, have a risk of forming a blood clot that can cause long-term or permanent loss of the ability to move (paralysis). Your risk of developing a spinal or epidural blood clot is higher if: A thin tube called an epidural catheter is placed in your back to give you certain medicine



You take NSAIDs or a medicine to prevent blood from clotting



You have a history of difficult or repeated epidural or spinal punctures



You have a history of problems with your spine or have had surgery on your spine

If you take XARELTO® and receive spinal anesthesia or have a spinal puncture, your doctor should watch you closely for symptoms of spinal or epidural blood clots. Tell your doctor right away if you have back pain, tingling, numbness, muscle weakness (especially in your legs and feet), or loss of control of the bowels or bladder (incontinence).

XARELTO® is not for people with artificial heart valves.

"The University of Texas at Arlington has successfully patented in Europe an implantable medical device that attracts and kills circulating cancer cells that was invented by a faculty member. This cancer trap can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer.

“Our cancer trap works just like a roach motel, where you put in some bait and the roach goes there and dies,” said Liping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and leader of the research. “We are putting biological agents in a cancer trap to attract and kill cancer cells.

“This method is effective for both diagnosing and treating metastasis cancer and can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy,” he added.

Currently, there are many treatments for primary tumors but they do little to prevent metastasis and stray cancer cells from relocating to another part of the body. Surgical removal of cancerous tissue also can spur the spread of cancer in the body. While there are drugs given to patients after surgery to prevent cancer cells from adhering to each other or other tissues, these drugs do not rid the body of cancer cells or collect them to allow an assessment of the patient’s status.

“We have made a nano-sized device that we can put under the skin using an injection needle to recruit the cancer cells into a small area where we can treat them with less overall side effects to the whole body,” Tang said.

“So the cancer trap is really complementary to current cancer treatments and especially beneficial at the early stages when it is difficult to see if the cancer is spreading as there are few cancer cells. We have also found it very effective in late stage cancers to stop the spread of the disease and to prolong lifespan,” he added.

Liping Tang, UTA bioengineering professor and inventor of the cancer trap

The cancer trap works by releasing different chemokines or regulatory proteins to attract circulating cancer cells and then expose them to chemotherapeutic agents to eradicate potential spreading. The trap has been tested in the lab and proved effective on many kinds of cancer cells, including melanoma, prostate cancer, breast cancer, lung cancer, leukemia and esophageal cancer.

“We are hoping to move toward clinical trials in the next few years as this technology could potentially significantly increase the lifespan of cancer patients,” Tang said.

This work on cancer forms part of a larger program at UTA where more than 30 faculty from different colleges and disciplines are developing new solutions to attack this disease.

With more than $4 million in research expenditures in 2017, UTA’s program for cancer encompasses basic cancer research, identification and diagnostics, as well as in noninvasive, midterm, invasive and postoperative therapies. UTA’s multidisciplinary research teams harness proficiencies from across science, engineering, computer science, nursing and kinesiology to tackle the challenges of precision oncology and cancer treatment.

Tang’s expertise encompasses a broad area, including stem cells, tissue engineering, nanotechnology, biocompatibility, biomaterials, inflammation, infection and fibrosis. He has published much of his work in high impact journals, including Biomaterials, Journal of Clinical Investigation, Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Blood, Journal of Experimental Medicine, and Tissue Engineering.

“Tang is a remarkable innovator and internationally recognized researcher,” said Michael Cho, UTA’s chair of bioengineering. “His work is a clear example of UTA’s strategic focus on health and the human condition and of the strength of multidisciplinary work.”",0
"Newswise — Multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the United States, impacting more than 25,000 people each year and disproportionatly affecting African-American men. While patients have access to more quality treatment therapies than ever before, the disease is still regarded as an incurable condition that often leads to death for those affected.

However, researchers at the University of Alabama at Birmingham Division of Hematology and Oncology are leading and currently recruiting for a Phase II clinical trial that intends to provide newly diagonosed multiple myeloma patients an innovative treatment plan. The hope is that the therapies will eradicate the disease in a significant proportion of patients and measure disease response more accurately than ever before.

The clinical trial Monoclonal Antibody Sequential Therapy for Deep Remission in Multiple Myeloma, also known as MASTER, utilizes next generation sequencing technology to detect minimal residual disease down to a level of one cancer cell in 100,000 — or 100- to 1,000-fold more sensitive than traditional methods to evaluate response. With a goal of enrolling 82 patients, those in the trial will be treated with a combination of anti-myeloma agents and immunotherapy that have a proven record of eliminating minimal residual disease, including the drug carfilzomib and the monoclonal antibody daratumumab, agents that are currently only approved to treat patients whose disease has returned.

“I believe for the first time that we have treatments that are effective enough to make it possible to eradicate multiple myeloma definitively in a substantial proportion of patients, along with having the technology to detect that the disease has been targeted and that treatment can be stopped,” said Luciano Costa, M.D., Ph.D., scientist at the UAB Comprehensive Cancer Center, lead of the Hematologic-Malignancy Working Group, and principal investigator of the MASTER study. “That is what patients want, after all — a treatment that gives them the possibility of eliminating any trace of the myeloma without having to be on therapy for the rest of their lives. It is a bold move, but bold moves are what our patients deserve.""

Multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the U.S., impacting more than 25,000 people each year and disproportionatly affecting African-American men.

This is one of the first trials in multiple myeloma to use minimal residual disease as primary endpoint and the very first one to modify therapy based on achievement of minimal residual disease eradication.

Up until now, existing therapies have been developed on trials that assigned treatment for a defined duration of time, irrespective of depth or speed of response, often followed by maintenance therapy for indefinite duration and with potentially adverse impact on risk of complications and cost. As it stands, patients with billions of cancer cells in their bodies and patients with true disease eradication will both appear to be in complete remission using current methods to measure disease response to therapy.

More than improving the results of the initial treatment, the MASTER study will treat patients for the necessary time to confirm elimination of minimal residual disease and then discontinue therapy. Patients will be monitored for relapse at the molecular level, before disease becomes again symptomatic.

In addition to UAB’s study leadership, Vanderbilt University Medical Center, Duke University, Medical College of Wisconsin, University of Wisconsin, and Oregon Health and Science University are recruiting for the trial as well.

The MASTER trial is supported by Amgen and Janseen, both with drug and finaincial support.",0
"Epilepsy patients who have not responded to standard drug treatments may benefit from a new therapy that delivers high frequency bursts of electrical stimulation, called microbursts, to the brain. Rush University Medical Center in Chicago is the first health care provider in the world to provide this treatment, known as microburst vagus nerve stimulation.

The treatment is akin to a heart pacemaker. A surgeon places an electronic pulse generator under the skin in the chest and attaches it to the left vagus nerve, which runs down the side of the body from the stem of the brain through the neck and chest to the abdomen.

The device sends regular electrical pulses through the vagus nerve to the brain to prevent epileptic seizures from occurring. The stimulator’s settings can be changed according to each patient’s needs using a special programming wand, with no additional surgery needed.

Dr. Rebecca O’Dwyer, assistant professor of neurology at Rush, is participating in a nationwide clinical study of the initial safety and effectiveness of microburst vagus nerve stimulation in patients who have drug-resistant epilepsy. She enrolled the first patient in the entire study on February 28.

“At the Rush Epilepsy Center, we regularly collaborate with members of the neurosurgery and neuroradiology department in our research endeavors. We look forward to the results of this study and hope we can bring relief to more people with epilepsy,” O’Dwyer said.

Rush was the first hospital in Chicago to offer epilepsy patients the original vagal nerve stimulator, which uses mild pulses of electricity, after the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved it in 1997 as an adjunctive treatment for drug-resistant epilepsy. “We are now exploring how higher frequency bursts delivered to the vagus nerve will affect epilepsy that does not respond to traditional therapies,” said O’Dwyer.

The study consists of two groups of patients with epilepsy, enrolling up to 40 patients in total at approximately 15 sites in the United States. The first group will include 20 patients with primary generalized tonic-clonic seizures. The second group will consist of 20 patients with partial onset seizures, including complex partial seizures with or without secondary generalization.

Each patient will participate in the study for a minimum of 15 months. The study will measure the percent change in seizure frequency and occurrence of stimulation-related adverse events in comparison to a patient’s baseline. Activation of various areas of the brain in response to stimulation will be assessed using functional magnetic resonance imaging or fMRI. Patients also will be evaluated to assess changes from baseline in seizure severity, quality of life, antiepileptic drug use, suicidality and adverse events.

To be considered for enrollment in the study or for information, contact The Rush Epilepsy Center at 312-942 5939.",0
"Sylentis, Pharmaceutical Company belonging to the PharmaMar Group, has presented results from the clinical studies carried out with tivanisiran for the treatment of dry eye syndrome and that has enabled the start-up of the Phase III ""Helix"" clinical trial. The presentation has taken place within the framework of the annual meeting of the Association for Research in Vision and Ophthalmology (ARVO) that has been held from the 29th of April to the 3rd of May in Honolulu, Hawaii.

The purpose if this meeting is to share the latest breakthroughs in research in the area of ophthalmology, to contribute to the progress in basic science and also in cutting-edge clinical research. In this context, Sylentis has participated at this event presenting the pre-clinical and clinical results of various compounds that are being developed for the treatment of ocular disorders. Among these, the abstract ""Tivanisiran a new treatment for Dry Eye Disease, that improved signs and symptoms in clinical trials"" (Posterboard number: 925 - B0103) is highlighted, the compound improving the ocular inflammatory parameters, tear quality and a reduction in ocular pain associated with dry eye disease is also underlined1.

The novel mechanism of action of tivanisiran, based on genetic silencing through RNA interference (RNAi), is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology, making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease.

According to Ana Isabel Jiménez, Director of R&D at Sylentis, ""we trust in our technology, innovative in this field, and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world.""

In this respect, Jiménez points out that ""this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the RNA.""

Sylentis is a pioneer in RNAi research, and is one of the few in Europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology. It also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses.

It must be empathized that this pathology affects more than 5 million in Spain, between 10% and 20% of the population, mostly women, and almost 100% of these being elderly , . In this context, the phase III ""Helix"" study is being carried out in more than 30 hospitals in Spain, Germany, Estonia, Portugal, Slovakia and Italy, in 300 patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome.

About tivanisiran (SYL1001)

Tivanisiran is a drug based on RNAi that is administered as preservative-free eye drops; it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel (TRPV1). These receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain. Tivanisiran is a small synthetic double-stranded RNA oligonucleotide (siRNA) with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action. Non-clinical studies conducted by Sylentis with SYL1001 have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals3.

Tivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain (corneal lesions, refractive surgery, etc.) , , .

About RNA interference (RNAi)

RNA interference (RNAi) is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes, providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants. This process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein-causing diseases. The therapeutic application of targeted siRNAs is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects. This new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space , .

About dry eye syndrome

Dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort, eyesight disorders, and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface. Dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain, itching, stinging, and irritation of the eye tissues. It is a characteristic disease of developed countries, associated with pollution, air conditioning, the use of contact lenses, refractive surgery and continued use of computers. Moreover, the amount and quality of tears decrease with age. Prevalence is between 10% and 20% among people aged 50 or over, and it is more frequent in womeni,ii.

Dry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum, but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome; oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general. However, the main treatment consists of artificial tears, in the form of drops, gel or creams. Preservative-free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long-term response.

"ROSEMONT, Ill. (May 1, 2018)--An estimated 45 percent of people are at risk of developing knee osteoarthritis (OA) in their lifetime. According to a network meta-analysis research article published in the May 1, 2018 issue of the Journal of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (JAAOS), the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) naproxen was ranked most effective in individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function, and is considered a relatively safe and low-cost treatment method.

Nonsurgical treatments for knee OA supported by previous research evidence include strength training, low-impact aerobic exercises, NSAIDs, and weight loss in individuals with a body mass index over 25. This new research analyzed data from multiple trials to determine the relative effectiveness of various nonsurgical treatments for knee OA. The treatments that were compared and ranked included acetaminophen; ibuprofen; intra-articular (IA) or joint injections of cortisone; platelet-rich plasma (PRP); hyaluronic acid (HA); several NSAIDs, such as naproxen, celecoxib, and diclofenac; and both oral and IA placebo.

""This is the first comprehensive mixed-comparison analysis comparing best-evidence scientific research and excluding lower quality studies that can bias the outcomes,"" said lead author and orthopaedic surgeon David Jevsevar, MD, MBA. ""Using a statistical ranking technique, we worked to provide evidence regarding which of the most common NSAIDs are most likely to decrease pain and improve function, and we attempted to fill in the gaps in evidence for more inconclusive treatments such as HA, PRP, and corticosteroids.""

Authors analyzed 53 randomized controlled trials that examined knee OA treatments for at least 28 days and included a minimum of 30 participants per study group. Knee OA treatments were ranked on a scale of one to five, with one being the most effective. They found the following:

For pain reduction, cortisone injections provided the greatest short-term (4 to 6 weeks) pain relief, followed by ibuprofen, PRP injections, naproxen, and celecoxib.

Naproxen ranked the highest for probability for improving function, followed by diclofenac, celecoxib, ibuprofen, and PRP injections.

Naproxen was ranked the most effective individual knee OA treatment for improving both pain and function followed by cortisone injections, PRP injections, ibuprofen and celecoxib.

HA injections did not achieve a rank in the top five treatments for pain, function, or combined pain and function. An analysis of 12 articles also found that results with HA are not significantly different from those with IA placebo for treatment of knee OA.

""Because knee OA has both a high disease burden and high treatment costs, additional prospective studies using similar outcomes, timelines, and measures of clinically important changes are needed,"" explained Dr. Jevsevar. ""While the information in this analysis is helpful to physicians, patients also can benefit from these findings and use it with their doctors to weigh all possible treatment options.""

Although the use of NSAIDs for arthritic conditions such as knee OA has potential risks, including heart attack and stroke, existing evidence indicates that naproxen has less potential for adverse cardiovascular events.

"CHICAGO - Screening patients for diabetes based solely on their age and weight - a recommendation from a leading medical expert group - could miss more than half of high-risk patients, according to a new Northwestern Medicine study of a nationwide sample. These limited screening criteria also missed more racial and ethnic minorities, most notably Asians.

Failing to screen high-risk adults could lead to delayed treatments to prevent type 2 diabetes or manage the condition for those who already have it, possibly contributing to a worsening of the diabetes epidemic. Prediabetes and diabetes affect half of U.S. adults with an estimated cost of $327 billion per year.

The United States Preventive Service Task Force (USPSTF) currently recommends that physicians screen patients for dysglycemia (prediabetes or type 2 diabetes) when they are 40 to 70 years old and are overweight or obese. By following this recommendation, 53 percent of patients who had prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would not be screened. The study showed that screening patients using an expanded set of risk factors, which the USPSTF suggests but does not formally recommend, would identify most cases of prediabetes and type 2 diabetes.

Only 23 percent of patients with prediabetes or diabetes would be missed if expanded screening criteria were used to make screening decisions, the study found. The expanded criteria include a family history of diabetes, history of gestational diabetes or polycystic ovarian syndrome or non-white race or ethnicity.

""This seems like a no-brainer to screen patients who have any of these additional risk factors,"" said lead author Dr. Matthew O'Brien, assistant professor of medicine at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""By demonstrating how well these expanded criteria work in identifying patients with prediabetes and diabetes, we're proposing a better path for the USPSTF to strengthen its screening guidelines.""

The study was published today, Friday, April 13, in the Journal of General Internal Medicine. O'Brien will be presenting his findings today at the Society for General Internal Medicine conference in Denver, Colorado. This is the first study to report how these expanded screening criteria would perform in practice among a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults.

The USPSTF has come under scrutiny for other screening recommendations, most notably for breast cancer. But there has been little attention focused on this group's most recent diabetes screening guideline.

Intensive lifestyle programs and some medications have been proven to prevent or delay type 2 diabetes among adults with prediabetes. A large volume of research over the last three decades has demonstrated that treating type 2 diabetes prevents life-threatening complications such as heart attacks, strokes and kidney failure.

""The earlier patients are diagnosed with these conditions, the sooner they can begin to combat them,"" O'Brien said.

African-Americans and Latinos develop type 2 diabetes at younger ages, so waiting until they are 40 years old to screen them is problematic, O'Brien said. In the study, 50 percent of whites with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes were identified using the limited criteria compared to only 48 percent of African-Americans and only 44 percent of Latinos.

Asians are at high risk of developing diabetes even at a healthy weight. By following the limited guidelines and only screening patients who are overweight or obese, approximately 30 percent of Asians with prediabetes or type 2 diabetes would be identified. That would leave 70 percent of Asians with prediabetes or diabetes undiagnosed until their next screening test, which could occur years later.

The study also touches on the financial implications of these guidelines. Under a provision in the Affordable Care Act, all services recommended by the USPSTF must be fully covered by insurers. But O'Brien said it is unclear whether insurers will be required to pay for diabetes screening if patients only meet the expanded criteria.

""This could be a particular problem for people of low socioeconomic status who are at high risk of developing diabetes and may be unable to pay for a screening test,"" O'Brien said.

The study was conducted collaboratively with the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), using data collected every year from a nationally representative sample of U.S. adults. It builds on findings from a previous study O'Brien conducted that incorporated electronic health record data from 50,515 adult primary care patients at community health centers in the Midwest and Southwest between 2008 and 2013.

"Scientists at the University of Waterloo have developed a new tool to protect women from HIV infection.

The tool, a vaginal implant, decreases the number of cells that the HIV virus can target in a woman's genital tract. Unlike conventional methods of HIV prevention, such as condoms or anti-HIV drugs, the implant takes advantage of some people's natural immunity to the virus.

HIV infects the body by corrupting T cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a person's body. When the T cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the HIV virus is not transmitted between people. When the T cells stay resting, it's referred to as being immune quiescent.

""We know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract, so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage T cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission,"" said Emmanuel Ho, a professor in the School of Pharmacy at Waterloo. ""What we don't know yet is if this can be a stand-alone option for preventing HIV transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies. We aim to answer these questions with future research.""

Ho's implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in Kenya. In Kenya, Ho and research partner Keith Fowke of the University of Manitoba, observed that many of these women who had sex with HIV positive clients but did not contract the virus. They later found the women possessed T cells that were naturally immune quiescent.

""Observing this, we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection,"" said Ho. ""By delivering the medication exactly where it's needed, we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence.""

The implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place. It contains hydroxychloroquine (HCQ) which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract.

The implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in T cell activation, meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state.

The article recently appeared in the Journal of Controlled Release.

"DANVILLE, Calif., April 11, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. (PAHS), developer of the drug-free Freespira® treatment for panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, today announced that another study has demonstrated clinically significant symptom improvement, with 80% of patients panic attack free one year after treatment.

This latest study, conducted as part of the VITAL Program at Allegheny Health Network in Pennsylvania, also demonstrated a 50% reduction in healthcare costs in patients with panic symptoms 12 months after being treated with Freespira.

A Symposium at the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA) Annual Conference in Washington, DC focused on the impact of abnormal breathing patterns on anxiety-related conditions and treatments as reported in five studies. Two studies reported nearly 80% of Freespira-treated patients were panic attack free at 12 months post-treatment. Two additional studies reported that patients with mixed anxiety disorders and low exhaled CO2 at baseline were less responsive and/or discontinued treatment with Cognitive Behavioral Therapy or Acceptance Commitment Therapy.

Early data from a fifth study reported on Freespira treatment for patients with Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). Ninety percent of patients in this study experienced a significant improvement in PTSD symptoms at two months and six months post-treatment.

Symposium Chair David Tolin, Ph.D., Director of Anxiety Disorders Center, The Institute of Living, and Adjunct Professor of Psychiatry, Yale University School of Medicine, commented, ""Studies of the Freespira treatment have shown that this innovative approach to treating patients suffering from panic symptoms and panic attacks not only significantly reduces or eliminates these symptoms in approximately 80% of patients, but also results in meaningful reduction in health costs.""

Debra Reisenthel, CEO of Palo Alto Health Sciences, added, ""Patients with panic symptoms and panic attacks have 3-5 times higher medical costs than patients without panic due to higher utilization of medical resources, including ED visits, physician visits and prescription drugs.""

Freespira is both easy to use and effective. Once a licensed healthcare provider authorizes the treatment and after a single training session, the patient uses Freespira at home, performing two 17-minute breathing sessions a day over a four-week period, after which the treatment is complete. The peer-reviewed published multi-center Freespira clinical trial, presented by Dr. Tolin, demonstrated that 71% of patients were panic attack free immediately after treatment and 79% of patients were panic attack free 12 months post-treatment.

About Freespira

Freespira is an FDA-cleared, drug-free, four-week at-home treatment for panic attacks and other panic symptoms. Treatment is authorized and completed under the supervision of a licensed healthcare provider. Freespira is clinically proven to reduce or eliminate panic attacks and other symptoms of panic disorder, a mental health condition in which debilitating anxiety leads to life-altering avoidance behaviors. Individuals with panic chronically hyperventilate, even when not experiencing a panic attack. This abnormal breathing pattern has been shown to exacerbate attacks. Freespira works by training the patient to stabilize respiration rate and exhaled carbon dioxide levels, which reduces or eliminates panic attacks.

About Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc.

Palo Alto Health Sciences, Inc. is a privately held digital therapeutic company revolutionizing behavioral healthcare with evidence-based, non-invasive, drug-free solutions. Their first product, Freespira, is an FDA-cleared treatment for individuals suffering from panic disorder, panic attacks and other symptoms of panic. In the United States, over 6.7 million adults annually suffer from panic disorder; panic attacks affect a total of 27 million adults in the U.S. every year and are a common component of other anxiety disorders.

"Researchers have discovered a new class of drug that has the potential to help cancer patients who no longer respond to existing therapies.

The drug may not become available to patients for a number of years yet, but researchers believe that if clinical trials are successful, it could be used to tackle a variety of treatment-resistant cancers.

Patients with breast cancer for example frequently become resistant to existing hormone-based treatments, leading to the disease becoming fatal.

In a bid to come up with new forms of treatment that work in a distinct way from established ones, chemists, biologists and clinicians at Imperial College London collaborated on creating a new drug, the properties of which are reported in the journal Molecular Cancer Therapeutics.

The team of scientists at Imperial was funded by Cancer Research UK. The drug was then developed by Imperial, in collaboration with Emory University in the USA.

Early lab-based tests of ICEC0942 were successful in targeting resistant breast cancers and indicated minimal side effects. ICEC0942 was then licenced to Carrick Therapeutics, who developed it into a molecule named CT7001, which they have taken to early-stage clinical trials in less than two years.

The first patient was given the drug in November 2017 as part of Carrick's a Phase I clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated. The trial is still ongoing, so results are not available yet.

Professor Charles Coombes, from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, said: ""Treatment-resistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients, as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do.

""Drugs such as these could help to shift the balance back in favour of the patients, potentially providing a new option to patients for who existing treatments no longer work.""

Professor Tony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, said: ""This work is the result of extensive collaboration between chemists, biologists and clinicians, which has helped to bring a new treatment from discovery to clinical testing in record time, streamlining the process.""

The drug targets an enzyme called CDK7, involved in directing cells through their lifecycle, which consists of growth, DNA replication and cell division. CDK7 is also involved in the process of transcription, a vital step in gene expression - the creation of proteins to carry out cell functions. Particular cancers, such as treatment-resistant breast cancers, have a unique dependence on transcription, meaning targeting CDK7 may be particularly effective.

By inhibiting transcription, ICEC0942 shuts down the ability of the cancer to spread. As well as breast cancers, cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia and small-cell lung cancer are particularly transcription-dependent, so ICEC0942 may work well for these too, especially where they have become resistant to other treatments.

The discovery of the drug was spurred by an initial meeting between Professor Anthony Barrett, from the Department of Chemistry, and oncologist Professor Charles Coombes from the Department of Surgery & Cancer.

Professor Simak Ali, also from the Department of Surgery & Cancer, was working on understanding the action of CDK7 in treatment-resistant breast cancer. Professors Coombes and Ali suggested CDK7 as a drug target, leading the collaboration to attempt to design a molecule that would inhibit its action.

From early attempts, a large collaborative team was eventually founded for drug discovery from 'bench to bedside', directed by Dr Matthew Fuchter in the Department of Chemistry. Possible compounds for CDK7 inhibition were modelled using computational drug design, aided by collaboration with Emory University.

Ultimately, a candidate molecule called ICEC0942 suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests. In addition, laboratory studies showed ICEC0942 worked better in combination with traditional hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells, which have not yet become resistant. It is this molecule, in oral pill form, that was taken forward by Carrick as CT7001 and is currently in Phase I clinical trials. If the Phase I trial proves successful, the compound must pass further stages of trial over the next few years before it becomes available to patients.

Early funding for the study came from the Engineering and Physical Sciences Research Council (EPSRC), and a major contribution of whole-project funding was from Cancer Research UK. Licensing of the technology to Carrick Therapeutics was led by Cancer Research UK's Commercial Partnerships Team and Imperial Innovations, the Technology Transfer Office of Imperial, with support from Emory University.

Dr Iain Foulkes, Cancer Research UK's executive director of research and innovation, said: ""It's exciting to see how Cancer Research UK's partnerships with both academia and industry are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients.

""Drug resistance continues to be a major challenge across many cancer types so it's vital that we explore new ways to tackle tumours that have stopped responding to standard therapies. We hope that this promising new class of drug will offer more options to patients who have few left available to them, and help more people survive their cancer.""

"Adding the monoclonal antibody drug trastuzumab--already used to treat certain breast cancers--to the chemotherapy regimen of women with a rare form of uterine cancer lengthens the amount of time their tumors are kept from growing, according to Johns Hopkins Medicine researchers conducting a small phase II trial of the regimen, testing its safety and value.

The results of the trial, published online ahead of print on March 27 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, show that the drug extended the length of time to tumor progression by four to eight months in the seven-year trial. The researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype, known as uterine serous carcinoma.

Uterine serous carcinoma makes up less than 10 percent of all cancers of the endometrium, or lining of the womb, diagnosed in the United States each year, but it accounts for more than a third of the 10,000 endometrial cancer deaths annually. The aggressive carcinomas often don't cause symptoms until they've begun to spread throughout the body. As a result, the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading--known as progression-free survival--is only about eight months.

""The fact that these tumors grow rapidly, but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early, is a double whammy for women,"" says Amanda Fader, M.D., associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, and first author of the new study.

Fader and her colleagues knew that about 30 percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for HER2/neu, a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about 10 percent of all breast cancers. Trastuzumab binds to and blocks HER2/neu, keeping it from driving tumor growth, and has been shown to be effective in so-called HER2 positive breast cancers.

From August 2011 through March 2017, Fader, Alessandro Santin, M.D., professor of gynecology and obstetrics at Yale University, and collaborators at 11 other cancer treatment centers in the U.S. randomly assigned 61 women with uterine serous carcinoma, being seen at the participating institutions, to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen--a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel--or those drugs plus trastuzumab. Some 41 of the patients had stage 3 or 4 uterine serous carcinoma--known as advanced disease--and 17 had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma. All tested positive for the HER2/neu receptor.

Among all patients, the 28 controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression-free survival time of eight months, and the 30 who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression-free survival time of 12.6 months. However, the difference was even more profound in the 41 patients with advanced disease, whose progression-free survival time went from an average of 9.3 months to 17.9 months with the addition of trastuzumab.

""Even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers,"" says Fader, who is also affiliated with the Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center at Johns Hopkins.

Among patients with recurrent disease, progression-free survival time increased from an average of six months to 9.2 months. The difference, Fader says, may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past, are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors, or tumors with different levels of HER2 expression.

Follow-up studies of the women who remain alive--who now number 35--continue, the researchers say, to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression. But the results of the trial, they add, were strong enough to warrant submission to the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country.

Fader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination, or other combinations, is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more. She notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express HER2/neu is part of a broader trend at Johns Hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy, or precision medicine, based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients.

"Mayo study shows easy-to-use, noninvasive stimulation device can help prevent migraine attacks

SCOTTSDALE, Arizona - A migraine is much more than just a bad headache. Migraine symptoms, which can be debilitating for many people, are the sixth leading cause of disability, according to the World Health Organization. While there is no cure, a new study published in Cephalalgia in March shows single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation is a new way to prevent migraine attacks. It's safe, easy to use and noninvasive.

MULTIMEDIA ALERT: Video and audio are avaiable for download on the Mayo Clinic News Network.

Researchers at Mayo Clinic and other major academic headache centers across the U.S. recently conducted the study that examined the effectiveness of using a single-pulse transcranial magnetic stimulation device to prevent migraine attacks. The eNeura SpringTMS Post-Market Observational U.S. Study of Migraine study, also known as ESPOUSE, instructed participants to self-administer four pulses with the device in the morning and four pulses at night over three months to prevent and treat migraine attacks as needed. Spring TMS stands for Spring transcranial magnetic stimulation or sTMS.

""The migraine brain is hyperexcitable, and basic science studies have demonstrated modulation of neuronal excitability with this treatment modality,"" says Amaal Starling, M.D., a Mayo Clinic neurologist, who is first author of the study. ""Our study demonstrated that the four pulses emitted from this device twice daily reduce the frequency of headache days by about three days per month, and 46 percent of patients had at least 50 percent or less migraine attacks per month on the treatment protocol. This data is clinically significant. Based on the current study and prior studies in acute migraine attack treatment, sTMS not only helps to stop a migraine attack, but it also helps prevent them.""

""For certain patients, treatment options for migraines, such as oral medications, are not effective, well-tolerated or preferred,"" Dr. Starling adds. ""The sTMS may be a great option for these patients and allow doctors to better meet their unique needs.""

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration already had approved the sTMS device for the acute treatment of migraine with aura. The FDA now has approved it to prevent migraine, as well.

"WASHINGTON, March 5, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc. (Vanda) (NASDAQ: VNDA) today announced that HETLIOZ®, a circadian regulator, demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder. HETLIOZ® is currently approved in the US and Europe for the treatment of Non-24-hour sleep-wake disorder, a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder.

Jet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones. Jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption, a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning.

The clinical efficacy results reported today are from the JET8 Phase-III clinical study (3107) (the JET8 study). In the JET8 study, 318 healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an 8 hours advance to their usual bedtime. The JET8 study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross 8 times zones, which leads to jet lag disorder. This clinical design allowed for the study of HETLIOZ® without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions.

Results from the JET8 study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of HETLIOZ® 20 mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints. The pre-specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night. Secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters (TST, LPS, WASO) and next day alertness (KSS and VAS). (Table 1).

Table 1: Summary of Primary and Key Secondary Endpoint Results

Assessment Endpoint HETLIOZ® Placebo Difference p-value Summary p-value Detail

PSG TST 2/3 * 216.4 156.1 60.3 p<0.0001 3.29E-12

(minutes) TST full 315.8 230.3 85.5 p<0.0001 3.74E-14



LPS 21.8 36.8 -15.1 p<0.01 8.08E-03



WASO 144.6 219.1 -74.6 p<0.0001 3.41E-12

















KSS (1-9) average 4.0 4.5 -0.5 p<0.01 8.28E-03

VAS (0-100) average 60.8 54.2 6.6 p<0.01 9.89E-03



*Primary endpoint.

The results of the JET8 study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of HETLIOZ® in treating jet lag disorder. The magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of 85 minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful. The demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both KSS and VAS is meaningful and it underscores the ability of HETLIOZ® to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder.

Vanda previously reported on the JET5 study (3101) that examined the effects of HETLIOZ® in a circadian challenge of 5 hours advance of the subjects' usual bedtime. The results of that study were published in The Lancet in 2009.1 The observation that HETLIOZ® is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of 5 or 8 hours suggests that HETLIOZ® will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag. HETLIOZ® will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers, the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle.

Jet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel. Jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel. It is reported that more than 30 million US residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations. Of these, 60% (approximately 20 million) travel to destinations in Europe, Middle East and Asia. It is also reported that 8% (approximately 1.6 million) travel in Business or First class.2

""We are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of HETLIOZ® in the treatment of jet lag disorder as HETLIOZ® was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an 8 hour phase advance. This challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across 8 time zones as experienced for example on travel from Los Angeles to London, Washington DC to Moscow, Paris to Tokyo, or London to Singapore. HETLIOZ® improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers,"" said Mihael H. Polymeropoulos, MD, Vanda's President and CEO.

Vanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of HETLIOZ® in the treatment of jet lag disorder. Vanda believes that if HETLIOZ® is approved by regulatory authorities for the treatment of jet lag disorder it will potentially offer a therapeutic solution to many travelers and will likely represent an important commercial opportunity for the company.

HETLIOZ® IS NOT CURRENTLY APPROVED BY ANY REGULATORY AUTHORITY FOR THE TREATMENT OF JET LAG DISORDER.

About HETLIOZ®

HETLIOZ® is a melatonin receptor agonist. HETLIOZ® has been granted market authorization by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency. For full U.S. prescribing information, please visit www.hetlioz.com.

Important Safety Information

The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ® (tasimelteon) than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ® is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.

Indication

HETLIOZ® is indicated for the treatment of Non-24-Hour Sleep-Wake Disorder (Non-24).

Important Safety Information

HETLIOZ® may cause somnolence: After taking HETLIOZ®, patients should limit their activity to preparing for going to bed, because HETLIOZ® can potentially impair the performance of activities requiring complete mental alertness.

The most common adverse reactions (incidence >5% and at least twice as high on HETLIOZ® than on placebo) were headache, increased alanine aminotransferase, nightmares or unusual dreams, and upper respiratory or urinary tract infection. The risk of adverse reactions may be greater in elderly (>65 years) patients than younger patients because exposure to HETLIOZ® is increased by approximately 2-fold compared with younger patients.

Use of HETLIOZ® should be avoided in combination with fluvoxamine or other strong CYP1A2 inhibitors, because of a potentially large increase in exposure of HETLIOZ®, and a greater risk of adverse reactions. HETLIOZ® should be avoided in combination with rifampin or other CYP3A4 inducers, because of a potentially large decrease in exposure of HETLIOZ®, with reduced efficacy.

There are no adequate and well-controlled studies of HETLIOZ® in pregnant women. Based on animal data, HETLIOZ® may cause fetal harm. HETLIOZ® should be used during pregnancy only if the potential benefit justifies the potential risks. Caution should be exercised when HETLIOZ® is administered to a nursing woman.

HETLIOZ® has not been studied in patients with severe hepatic impairment and is not recommended in these patients.

"People with stage III colon cancer who regularly eat nuts are at significantly lower risk of cancer recurrence and mortality than those who don’t, according to a new, large study led by researchers at Yale Cancer Center. The findings were published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The study followed 826 participants in a clinical trial for a median of 6.5 years after they were treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Those who regularly consumed at least two, one-ounce servings of nuts each week demonstrated a 42% improvement in disease-free survival and a 57% improvement in overall survival. “Further analysis of this cohort revealed that disease-free survival increased by 46% among the subgroup of nut consumers who ate tree nuts rather than peanuts,” said Charles S. Fuchs, M.D., director of Yale Cancer Center and senior author of the study. Tree nuts include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others. In contrast, peanuts are actually in the legume family of foods. “These findings are in keeping with several other observational studies that indicate that a slew of healthy behaviors — including increased physical activity, keeping a healthy weight, and lower intake of sugar and sweetened beverages — improve colon cancer outcomes,” said Temidayo Fadelu, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead author of the paper. “The results highlight the importance of emphasizing dietary and lifestyle factors in colon cancer survivorship.” Additionally, the researchers emphasized, the study highlighted connections between biological mechanisms that worsen disease not just in colon cancer but in certain chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. Many previous studies have reported that nuts, among other health benefits, may help to reduce insulin resistance, a condition in which the body has difficulty processing the insulin hormone. Insulin resistance leads to unhealthy levels of sugar in the blood and is often a predecessor to type 2 diabetes and related illnesses. Earlier research among patients with colon cancer has revealed worse outcomes among those with lifestyle factors — such as obesity, lack of exercise, and a diet with high levels of carbohydrates — that heighten insulin resistance and quickly raise levels of blood sugar. “These studies support the hypothesis that behaviors that make you less insulin-resistant, including eating nuts, seem to improve outcomes in colon cancer,” Fuchs said. “However, we don’t know yet what exactly about nuts is beneficial.” Nuts also might play a positive role by satisfying hunger with less intake of carbohydrates or other foods associated with poor outcomes, Fuchs noted. Patients may not be eating nuts due to concerns about the high fat content, said Fuchs. For example, a one-ounce serving of about 24 almonds holds about 200 calories, including 14 grams of fat. “People ask me if increasing nut consumption will lead to obesity, which leads to worse outcomes,” he said. “But what’s really interesting is that in our studies, and across the scientific literature in general, regular consumers of nuts tend to be leaner.” Dietary changes can make a difference. An earlier analysis of diets in the same patient cohort by Fuchs and his colleagues found a significant link between coffee consumption and reduced recurrence and mortality in colon cancer. When Fuchs advises his patients about lifestyle choices, “first and foremost I talk about avoiding obesity, exercising regularly, and staying away from a high-carbohydrate diet,” he said. “Then we talk about things like coffee and nuts. If you like coffee or nuts, enjoy them, and if you don’t, there are many other helpful steps you can take.” “Overall, we are working to apply the same rigorous science to the understanding of diet and lifestyles in the colon cancer patient population that we apply to defining new drugs,” Fuchs said. Co-corresponding authors on the paper are Jeffrey Meyerhardt, M.D., of Dana-Farber and Ying Bao, M.D., of Brigham and Women’s Hospital. Lead funding for the research was provided by the National Cancer Institute. Support also came from private sponsors including Pfizer Oncology and the International Tree Nut Council Nutrition Research & Education Foundation. The private sponsors did not participate in the design, conduct, or analysis of the study, or in review or approval of the paper.",1
"A treatment that improves the lives of nearly 1.3 million people with rheumatoid arthritis might one day originate from scorpion venom. A group of researchers led by Dr. Christine Beeton at Baylor College of Medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models, without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments. The study appears in the Journal of Pharmacology and Experimental Therapeutics.

""Rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease - one in which the immune system attacks its own body. In this case, it affects the joints,"" said Beeton, associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member Dan L Duncan Comprehensive Cancer Center at Baylor College of Medicine. ""Cells called fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) play a major role in the disease. As they grow and move from joint to joint, they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain. As damage progresses, the joints become enlarged and are unable to move.""

Current treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for FLS. Beeton and her colleagues studied FLS looking for an 'Achilles' heel' that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints.

""In previous work, we identified a potassium channel on FLS of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease,"" Beeton said. ""We wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints.""

Potassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions - small charged atoms - to flow in and out of the cell. The flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions. Animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels. They use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey. Decades ago, scientists discovered this and realized that, if handled correctly, venoms also might have medicinal applications.

Scorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis

""Scorpion venom has hundreds of different components. One of the components in the venom of the scorpion called Buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of FLS and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system,"" said first author Dr. Mark Tanner, a graduate student in the Beeton lab during the development of this project. ""Here, we investigated whether this venom component, called iberiotoxin, would be able to specifically block the FLS potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease.""

When the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin, they stopped the progression of the disease. In some cases they reversed the signs of established disease, meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints. In addition, treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects, such as tremors and incontinence, observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline.

""It was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in FLS and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells, which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence,"" Tanner said.

""Although these results are promising, much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis,"" Beeton said. ""We think that this venom component, iberiotoxin, can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future.""

"For Immediate Release: February 13, 2018

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury (mTBI), commonly referred to as concussion, in adults. The FDA reviewed and authorized for marketing the Banyan Brain Trauma Indicator in fewer than 6 months as part of its Breakthrough Devices Program.

Most patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale, called the 15-point Glasgow Coma Scale, followed by a computed tomography or CT scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage, or intracranial lesions, that may require treatment; however, a majority of patients evaluated for mTBI/concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a CT scan. Availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a CT scan in patients suspected of having mTBI and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients.

“Helping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an FDA priority. Today’s action supports the FDA’s Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging—an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,” said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. “A blood-testing option for the evaluation of mTBI/concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool, but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases. In addition, availability of a blood test for mTBI/concussion will likely reduce the CT scans performed on patients with concussion each year, potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests.”

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, in 2013 there were approximately 2.8 million TBI-related emergency department visits, hospitalizations and deaths in the U.S. Of these cases, TBI contributed to the deaths of nearly 50,000 people. TBI is caused by a bump, blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain’s normal functioning. Its severity may range from mild to severe, with 75 percent of TBIs that occur each year being assessed as mTBIs or concussions. A majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative CT scan. Potential effects of TBI can include impaired thinking or memory, movement, sensation or emotional functioning.

“A blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the American public and for our Service Members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests,” said Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health. “The FDA’s review team worked closely with the test developer and the U.S. Department of Defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mTBI that can be used both in the continental U.S. as well as foreign U.S. laboratories that service the American military.”

The Brain Trauma Indicator works by measuring levels of proteins, known as UCH-L1 and GFAP, that are released from the brain into blood and measured within 12 hours of head injury. Levels of these blood proteins after mTBI/concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by CT scan and which won’t. Being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a CT scan. Test results can be available within 3 to 4 hours.

The FDA evaluated data from a multi-center, prospective clinical study of 1,947 individual blood samples from adults with suspected mTBI/concussion and reviewed the product’s performance by comparing mTBI/concussion blood tests results with CT scan results. The Brain Trauma Indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a CT scan 97.5 percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a CT scan 99.6 percent of the time. These findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a CT scan in at least one-third of patients who are suspected of having mTBI.

The Brain Trauma Indicator was reviewed under the FDA’s De Novo premarket review pathway, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device.

The FDA is permitting marketing of the Brain Trauma Indicator to Banyan Biomarkers, Inc.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

"NIH scientists adapt new brain disease test for Parkinson’s, dementia with Lewy bodies

NIAID

What

National Institutes of Health scientists developing a rapid, practical test for the early diagnosis of prion diseases have modified the assay to offer the possibility of improving early diagnosis of Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies. The group, led by NIH’s National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), tested 60 cerebral spinal fluid samples, including 12 from people with Parkinson’s disease, 17 from people with dementia with Lewy bodies, and 31 controls, including 16 of whom had Alzheimer’s disease. The test correctly excluded all the 31 controls and diagnosed both Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies with 93 percent accuracy.

Importantly, test results were available within two days, compared to related assays that require up to 13 days. The group conducted the tests using Real-Time Quaking-Induced Conversion (RT-QuIC), an assay developed and refined over the past decade at NIAID’s Rocky Mountain Laboratories. Scientists from the University of California San Diego, University of Verona in Italy, Indiana University School of Medicine, Indianapolis, and the Case Western Reserve University School of Medicine, Cleveland, collaborated on the project. The research findings were published in Acta Neuropathologica Communications.

Multiple neurological disorders, including Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies, involve the abnormal clumping of a protein called alpha-synuclein into brain deposits called Lewy bodies. The pathological processes in these diseases resembles prion diseases in mammal brains. Like prion diseases, Parkinson’s disease and dementia with Lewy bodies result in progressive deterioration of brain functions and, ultimately, death. Parkinson’s disease is about 1,000 times more common than prion diseases, affecting up to 1 million people in the United States, with 60,000 new cases diagnosed each year. Lewy body dementia affects an estimated 1.4 million people in the United States, according to the Lewy Body Dementia Association.

Early and accurate diagnoses of these brain disorders is essential for developing treatments and identifying patients eligible for clinical trials. The diseases typically progress for years before symptoms appear, and once they do, distinguishing one disease from another can be difficult.

The NIAID group continues to adapt the RT-QuIC assay to detect additional types of neurological diseases with greater accuracy using the least invasive patient sample possible — whether that is blood, skin, nasal brushings, or other samples. The group also has trained many international colleagues to use and advance the test.

NIH…Turning Discovery Into Health®",1
"Newswise — Toronto, ON (February 5, 2018) -- A deceased donor kidney has been preserved and kept healthy outside the body in a device that mimics the body’s physiological functions and successfully transplanted into a human, for the first time in North America.

The technique, unique solution, and device are part of a Phase I clinical trial at Toronto General Hospital (TG), University Health Network (UHN), assessing the safety of the device, with subsequent phases examining its efficacy.

Kidneys are the most frequently transplanted solid organ, but a continuing shortage of donor kidneys impacts wait times and quality of life of those waiting for a transplant.

One way to address this gap by the transplant community worldwide has been to extend the criteria of those donor kidneys used for transplantation. But these “extended criteria” organs – those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors - do not tolerate current “cold storage” methods for organ preservation well.

This can result in greater injury to the kidney, or in a “sleepy kidney” which functions poorly at the beginning, requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later. This early delayed function also impacts its longer-term survival.

In Ontario, about 20 per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys. This means donors are on average older than 60 years, or younger than 60 years and likely have hypertension, higher BMI (body mass index), diabetes, or died due to stroke.

Ex vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current “cold storage” method of preservation.

Developed in the laboratory of UHN transplant surgeon Dr. Markus Selzner, with the help of UHN transplant surgeons Drs. David Grant and Anand Ghanekar, as well as Drs. Lisa Robinson and Darius Bagli from The Hospital for Sick Children (SickKids), it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heart-lung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique.

This technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees Celsius, with no oxygen, slowing down its metabolism, and inhibiting the repair process.

The kidney cannot survive longer than 30 hours in cold preservation. The new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients.

Using a heart-lung bypass machine, with customized tubing adapted to the kidney’s smaller blood vessels - and a specially blended preservation solution of blood, nutrients, minerals, amino acids, oxygen, glucose, antibiotics and drugs – surgeons, nurses and perfusionists at TG prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late November, 2017.

The aim was to enhance kidney function, minimize injury and avoid a “sleepy kidney” from an extended criteria kidney. About 30-40 per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately, requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis.

Zhao Xiao, 53, received the deceased donor kidney, which was placed on the device for 3.5 hours at body temperature.

“I feel great,” says Xiao, through an interpreter. He was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant. Xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology.

“This can make a difference to other patients, so I am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience.”

As soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient, it turned ruby-red and started to pour out urine, indicating that it was functioning well.

“It is a champion!” says an elated Dr. Selzner, who has done about 500 kidney transplants in the past 14 years. “It behaved like a normal kidney, despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney.”

He points out blood tests within 48 hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally. Since the kidney did not “struggle” after transplant, there is a greater likelihood that its long-term outcome will be better, he adds.

“This technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation, allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient. We will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation,” says Dr. Markus Selzner, co-investigator of the clinical trial.

Dr. Selzner, a clinician-scientist at the Toronto General Hospital Research Institute and Associate Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ.

“Working on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career,” says Dr. Lisa Robinson, Division Head of Nephrology at SickKids. “It is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research, and now to directly impacting patients.”

“Even with the shortage of donor organs, we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process,” says Dr. David Grant, Surgical Director of the Multi-Organ Transplant Program, UHN. He is also co-investigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney, which was on the modified heart-lung bypass machine, into the recipient.

“This new technology can help us answer the critical question, ‘What’s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients?’”

Dr. Grant, who is also Professor of Surgery at the University of Toronto, emphasized that high-impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams – including researchers, surgical residents, nurses, Canadian Blood Services, perfusionists, colleagues at SickKids - working together on experimental and clinical trials.

“UHN is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen.”

Other collaborators on the research and clinical trial at UHN include: Drs. Joseph Kim and Anand Ghanekar, co-leads of the kidney transplant program at UHN and transplant nephrologist Dr. Istvan Mucsi.

Dr. Grant also praised the strong support and efforts of Trillium Gift of Life, which co-ordinates organ and tissue donation across Ontario, in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique.

The technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the Toronto Lung Transplant Program at TG in 2008 by Drs. Shaf Keshavjee and Marcelo Cypel to better treat, repair and assess high-risk donor lungs outside the body. The lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen, proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs, mimicking normal physiological conditions.

This makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves, and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs. Since 2012, there has been an unprecedented 63 per cent increase in lung transplants at TG as a result of this system.

At any point in time, there are about 1,500 patients waiting for a transplant in Ontario. About 1,000 people wait for a kidney transplant across the province, usually about four years. About five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year.

Research for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the Canadian National Transplant Research Program (CNTRP), a national research network designed to increase organ and tissue donation in Canada and enhance the survival and quality of life of Canadians who receive transplants.

Generous philanthropic support, made through Toronto General & Western Hospital Foundation, has played and continues to play an integral role in the development of ex vivo technology and its impact on patients’ lives.

"LOS ANGELES, Jan. 25, 2018 -- Clot removal may be beneficial up to 24 hours following stroke in carefully selected patients, but every hour delayed after symptoms begin may be associated with more disability, according to preliminary research presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference 2018, a world premier meeting dedicated to the science and treatment of cerebrovascular disease for researchers and clinicians.

The international DAWN trial previously demonstrated that patients with a small area of irreversible brain damage and a large area of brain at jeopardy of being lost if the clot remains are more likely to recover with minimal disability if the clot is removed up to 24 hours after symptoms begin or were noticed. It is already well-established that the benefit of clot removal declines each hour during the first 6 hours after symptoms are detected.

In the current analysis of treatment between 6 and 24 hours after symptoms were observed, or after the person was last seen to be well, researchers found:

each 1-hour delay reduces the chance of recovery with minimal or no disability by 11 percent; and

treatment remains beneficial through 24 hours, with patients who had their clots removed being 35.5 percent more likely to have minimal or no disability 90 days later, but the overall effect of treatment declines with time.

The current results demonstrate the importance of prompt imaging and treatment of patients with clot-caused stroke, even in those who wake up having experienced a stroke or who for other reasons are not identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms.

"Newswise — Lovers of Indian food, give yourselves a second helping: Daily consumption of a certain form of curcumin — the substance that gives Indian curry its bright color — improved memory and mood in people with mild, age-related memory loss, according to the results of a study conducted by UCLA researchers.

The research, published online Jan. 19 in the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry, examined the effects of an easily absorbed curcumin supplement on memory performance in people without dementia, as well as curcumin’s potential impact on the microscopic plaques and tangles in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease.

Found in turmeric, curcumin has previously been shown to have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties in lab studies. It also has been suggested as a possible reason that senior citizens in India, where curcumin is a dietary staple, have a lower prevalence of Alzheimer’s disease and better cognitive performance.

“Exactly how curcumin exerts its effects is not certain, but it may be due to its ability to reduce brain inﬂammation, which has been linked to both Alzheimer’s disease and major depression,” said Dr. Gary Small, director of geriatric psychiatry at UCLA’s Longevity Center and of the geriatric psychiatry division at the Semel Institute for Neuroscience and Human Behavior at UCLA, and the study’s first author.

The double-blind, placebo-controlled study involved 40 adults between the ages of 50 and 90 years who had mild memory complaints. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or 90 milligrams of curcumin twice daily for 18 months.

All 40 subjects received standardized cognitive assessments at the start of the study and at six-month intervals, and monitoring of curcumin levels in their blood at the start of the study and after 18 months. Thirty of the volunteers underwent positron emission tomography, or PET scans, to determine the levels of amyloid and tau in their brains at the start of the study and after 18 months.

The people who took curcumin experienced significant improvements in their memory and attention abilities, while the subjects who received placebo did not, Small said. In memory tests, the people taking curcumin improved by 28 percent over the 18 months. Those taking curcumin also had mild improvements in mood, and their brain PET scans showed significantly less amyloid and tau signals in the amygdala and hypothalamus than those who took placebos.

The amygdala and hypothalamus are regions of the brain that control several memory and emotional functions.

Four people taking curcumin, and two taking placebos, experienced mild side effects such as abdominal pain and nausea.

The researchers plan to conduct a follow-up study with a larger number of people. That study will include some people with mild depression so the scientists can explore whether curcumin also has antidepressant effects. The larger sample also would allow them to analyze whether curcumin’s memory-enhancing effects vary according to people’s genetic risk for Alzheimer’s, their age or the extent of their cognitive problems.

"A new study suggests that continuous movement while sitting may increase metabolic rate more than standing at a desk.

Craig Horswill, clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois at Chicago, says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing non-exercise active thermogenesis — defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine — are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting.

Sitting has been identified as a risk factor for early mortality, independent of the presence of a disease, such as cancer or diabetes. Up to 7 percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone.

“Sitting is bad for our health, but it is a big part of daily life for many people,” said Horswill, an expert in exercise and metabolism in UIC’s College of Applied Health Sciences. “Exercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting, but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle.”

Because the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior, with more than 20 percent of workers in the U.S. reporting more than 8 hours each day, tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years, including standing desks, as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations.

Horswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations: seated at a desk, seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk. The device, which is commercially available, was a movable footrest, suspended from the underside of the desk, which enabled the feet to swing, twist or teeter.

Participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit. On a second visit, researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages: seated, seated with the device and standing. Each stage was 15 minutes.

The researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing, by 17 and 7 percent respectively, and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function. The findings are published in WORK, a journal affiliated with the Canadian Association of Occupational Therapists and endorsed by the International Ergonomics Association.

“These results suggest that non-exercise active thermogenesis, which we call NEAT, can increase movement and calorie burning, and may have the potential to impact health,” said Horswill, the senior author on the study. “We expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage, but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing.”

Horswill says the study needs to be further validated, but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from NEAT but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury, disability or discomfort.

“This is more evidence that NEAT, something everyone can do throughout the day, may be an important strategy for improving health, and even reducing early death,” said Horswill.

"CHICAGO -- Among women with dense breast tissue, for whom traditional mammograms are less effective at detecting cancer, who request additional screening after a negative mammogram, abbreviated breast MRI (AB-MR) may be a valuable cancer detection tool. In a study of 195 asymptomatic women with dense breast tissue who had a negative mammogram within the previous 11 months, AB-MR detected five additional cancers after a negative screening mammography, according to preliminary findings from a Penn Medicine team presented this week at the Radiological Society of North America meeting in Chicago.

To put this in perspective, the cancer detection rate of mammography is roughly 4 cancers in 1,000 women who have a mammogram. Digital tomosynthesis (DBT), or 3D mammography, does slightly better, detecting approximately 25 percent more cancers, or roughly 5 cancers in 1,000 women screened. Based on the preliminary results at Penn Medicine, the cancer detection rate of AB-MR screening is 25 cancers per 1,000 patients. One in eight women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point during their life.

""Having dense breast tissue makes it more difficult to detect a cancer on a mammogram,"" said the study's lead author, Susan Weinstein, MD, an associate professor of Radiology and the director of breast MRI at Penn Medicine. ""Based on the literature and our results, women with dense breast tissue who desire supplemental screening, these results suggest that AB-MR may be a better option than other supplemental screening tests such as whole breast ultrasound.

The most common exam offered for asymptomatic patients seeking supplemental screening is a whole breast screening ultrasound examination. However, screening ultrasound examinations have higher rates of false positives, meaning more cases of positive screenings where no cancer is present.

Based on the results from Penn's study, the AB-MR may be a better option. American Cancer Society guidelines currently recommend a full breast MRI, not an AB-MR, in women who, based on family history of breast or ovarian cancer and/or previous treatment for Hodgkin disease, have a 20 to 25 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer.

"ANN ARBOR--New research from the University of Michigan Life Sciences Institute has determined how a common holiday spice--cinnamon--might be enlisted in the fight against obesity.

Scientists had previously observed that cinnamaldehyde, an essential oil that gives cinnamon its flavor, appeared to protect mice against obesity and hyperglycemia. But the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood.

Researchers in the lab of Jun Wu, research assistant professor at the LSI, wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde's action and determine whether it might be protective in humans, too.

""Scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism,"" said Wu, who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the U-M Medical School. ""So we wanted to figure out how--what pathway might be involved, what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells.""

Their findings, which appear in the December issue of the journal Metabolism, indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells, or adipocytes, inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis.

Wu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages, ethnicities and body mass indices. When the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde, the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism. They also observed an increase in Ucp1 and Fgf21, which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis.

Adipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids. This long-term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors, who had much less access to high-fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat. That fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures, which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat.

""It's only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem,"" Wu said. ""Throughout evolution, the opposite--energy deficiency--has been the problem. So any energy-consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn't need it.""

With the rising obesity epidemic, researchers like Wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis, turning those fat-burning processes back on.

Wu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method. And because it is already used widely in the food industry, it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon-based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen.

""Cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years, and people generally enjoy it,"" Wu said. ""So if it can help protect against obesity, too, it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to.""

Now, before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday-season pounds at bay, Wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde's metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects.

"MAYWOOD, IL – A groundbreaking Loyola Medicine study suggests that a simple 15-minute electrocardiogram could help a physician determine whether a patient has major depression or bipolar disorder. Bipolar disorder often is misdiagnosed as major depression. But while the symptoms of the depressive phase of bipolar disorder are similar to that of major depression, the treatments are different and often challenging for the physician. In bipolar disorder, formerly called manic depression, a patient swings between an emotional high (manic episode) and severe depression. Treatment for the depressed phase includes an antidepressant along with a safeguard such as a mood stabilizer or antipsychotic drug to prevent a switch to a manic episode. A physician who misdiagnoses bipolar disorder as major depression could inadvertently trigger a manic episode by prescribing an antidepressant without a safeguard mood stabilizing drug. The study found that heart rate variability, as measured by an electrocardiogram, indicated whether subjects had major depression or bipolar disorder. (Heart rate variability is a variation in the time interval between heartbeats.) The study, by senior author Angelos Halaris, MD, PhD and colleagues, was published in the World Journal of Biological Psychiatry. ""Having a noninvasive, easy-to-use and affordable test to differentiate between major depression and bipolar disorder would be a major breakthrough in both psychiatric and primary care practices,"" Dr. Halaris said. Dr. Halaris said further research is needed to confirm the study’s findings and determine their clinical significance. Dr. Halaris is a professor in Loyola's department of psychiatry and behavioral neurosciences and medical director of adult psychiatry. Major depression is among the most common and severe health problems in the world. In the United States, at least 8 to 10 percent of the population suffers from major depression at any given time. While less common than major depression, bipolar disorder is a significant mental health problem, affecting an estimated 50 million people worldwide. The Loyola study enrolled 64 adults with major depression and 37 adults with bipolar disorder. All subjects underwent electrocardiograms at the start of the study. Each participant rested comfortably on an exam table while a three-lead electrocardiogram was attached to the chest. After the patient rested for 15 minutes, the electrocardiographic data were collected for 15 minutes. Using a special software package, researchers converted the electrocardiographic data into the components of heart rate variability. These data were further corrected with specialized software programs developed by study co-author Stephen W. Porges, PhD, of Indiana University's Kinsey Institute. In measuring heart rate variability, researchers computed what is known to cardiologists as respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA). At the baseline (beginning of the study), the subjects with major depression had significantly higher RSA than those with bipolar disorder. In a secondary finding, researchers found that patients with bipolar disorder had higher blood levels of inflammation biomarkers than patients with major depression. Inflammation occurs when the immune system revs up in response to a stressful condition such as bipolar disorder. The study is titled ""Low cardiac vagal tone index by heart rate variability differentiates bipolar from major depression."" In addition to Drs. Halaris and Porges, other co-authors are Brandon Hage, MD, a graduate of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine now at the University of Pittsburgh (first author); Stritch student Briana Britton; Loyola psychiatric resident David Daniels, MD; and Keri Heilman, PhD of the University of North Carolina.",0
"DARIEN, IL - Nov. 16, 2017 - A new study shows that positive airway pressure (PAP) therapy improves quality of life measures in people who have obstructive sleep apnea.

Results show that there were significant and clinically meaningful improvements in general quality of life and sleep-related quality of life measures after the initiation of PAP therapy for sleep apnea. The improvements were more robust in those who were adherent to PAP therapy.

""Quality of life is one of the most vital outcomes for patients and often one of the primary reasons to seek medical attention,"" said lead author and principal investigator Dr. Harneet Walia, assistant professor at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and staff at the Cleveland Clinic's Sleep Disorders Center. ""We noted consistent improvement in global and sleep-specific quality-of-life measures after PAP therapy.""

The study is published in the Nov. 15 issue of the Journal of Clinical Sleep Medicine.

Nearly 30 million adults in the U.S. have obstructive sleep apnea, a chronic disease that involves the repeated collapse of the upper airway during sleep. Common warning signs include snoring and excessive daytime sleepiness. One treatment option for sleep apnea is PAP therapy, which uses mild levels of air pressure, provided through a mask, to keep the throat open while you sleep.

The study involved 2,027 patients with sleep apnea who began PAP therapy between Jan. 1, 2010, and Dec. 31, 2014. Participants had a mean age of 56 years, and about 54 percent were men. General quality of life measures, such as mobility and usual activity, were assessed using the European Quality of Life-5D (EQ-5D) questionnaire. Sleep-specific quality of life was examined with the Functional Outcomes of Sleep Questionnaire (FOSQ), which assesses the effect of sleep disorders and excessive daytime sleepiness on activities of daily living such as productivity and intimacy. Scores before and after up to one year of PAP therapy were compared.

Results also show that older patients and those in a higher socioeconomic subgroup had better quality of life measures after PAP therapy.

""Our study also serves as a basis for targeted efforts to optimize quality of life in younger adults and lower socioeconomic subgroups,"" said Walia. ""This information will guide clinicians in terms of expected quality of life outcomes with sleep apnea treatment."" The American Academy of Sleep Medicine previously identified quality of life as one of three sleep apnea outcome measures that clinicians can track to optimize care for adult patients. Implementation of a quality assurance program to track these quality measures can help improve patient outcomes, reduce the public health burden of sleep apnea, and provide a measurable standard for evaluating and managing sleep apnea.

"The 161 subjects involved in the study consumed at least three portions of chicken and eggs per week, that were naturally enriched with omega-3 Polyunsaturated Fatty Acids (PUFA), the same nutrients found in oily fish.

The results from the clinical study saw an increase in omega-3-PUFA levels in blood and a positive shift in what is described as the 'omega-3 Index'-a test that measures the amount of the omega-3 fatty acids, Docosahexaenoic Acid (DHA) and Eicosapentaenoic Acid (EPA) in red blood cell membranes, which reflects the levels in your heart and other tissues.

A low omega-3 Index (<4%) indicates a heightened risk of heart and brain disease. The study showed that consuming omega-3 enriched chicken and eggs resulted in a halving of the number of subjects with such a high-risk omega-3 Index.

The chicken meat and eggs used in the study came from birds offered OmegaPro, a sustainable and algae-based source of omega-3 PUFA, developed by Devenish.

The findings were presented by Professor Alice Stanton of The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland:

""Greater consumption of oily fish has long been linked to a reduced incidence of heart attack, stroke, diabetes and cancer and improved brain health, vision, muscle and joint health,"" said Professor Alice Stanton.

""International guidelines recommend eating oily fish at least once per week, however, many people do not eat fish at all and less than 20% of the world's population have optimal omega-3 PUFA levels.

""Therefore, in this project we studied the recently developed alternatives to oily fish or supplementation, namely chicken meat and eggs, naturally enriched with sustainable algae-based omega-3 PUFA.

""Omega-3 enriched chicken and eggs offer consumers an attractive alternative to eating oily fish or to the lifelong taking of supplements, with the potential for substantial health benefits,"" Professor Stanton said.

Dr. Heather Hayes, Director of Food Innovation with Devenish, said:

""Offering birds a natural and sustainable source of omega-3 PUFA is good for the bird and good for the consumer. Taste panel studies have shown that the omega-3 enriched chicken meat tastes as good, if not better than conventional chicken.

""This science has demonstrated the importance of food nutrients to promote good health and prevent ill health. We are also focusing our research efforts on producing sustainable and nutrient rich pork, beef and milk, with scientifically proven health claims. Omega-3 is just one nutrient that we are interested in-we are working on others too.""

Owen Brennan, Executive Chairman, Devenish, added:

""We worked closely with Moy Park, Waitrose and the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, to deliver an innovative, nutrient-rich food, that increases omega-3 levels in consumers, naturally. The science shows the importance of food nutrients to promote good health in consumers and the innovation starts on the farm.

""The farmer has a key role to play in delivering sustainable and nutritious food with a health claim. Devenish is working hard to increase the opportunity for consumers to benefit from this nutrient-rich food, as less than 20% of the world's population is eating enough Omega-3.""

Dr. Patrick Wall, Professor of Public Health at University College Dublin, said:

""By enriching the birds' diet, the meat and eggs become naturally enriched with omega-3 PUFA and the associated nutritional benefits are then passed on to consumers.

""Morbidity is unevenly distributed in society and poorer people experience poorer health. By including the omega-3 in chicken and eggs, both very affordable sources of quality protein, all segments of the population can benefit from this approach to using innovative animal nutrition to benefit human health.""

Professor Chris Elliott, Founder of the Institute for Global Food Security & Pro Vice Chancellor, Faculty of Medicine, Health & Life Sciences, Queens University Belfast said:

""The cost to the health service of treating cardiovascular related illness in the UK is £10billion/year. Having access to sustainably produced nutrient-rich food, with a scientifically proven health claim, offers huge potential to turn this around globally.""

"""We are committed to providing patients with the highest quality, most effective options to address their urology needs,"" said Matthias Hofer, MD , urologist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital. ""The UroLift System has an excellent safety profile and provides men suffering from an enlarged prostate a beneficial first-line treatment alternative to drug therapy or more invasive surgery. Importantly, the UroLift System provides fast and meaningful relief from BPH symptoms, improving overall quality of life for our patients.""

The UroLift System's permanent implants, delivered during a minimally-invasive procedure, act like window curtain tie-backs to hold the lobes of an enlarged prostate open. Patients recover from the procedure quickly, and return to their normal routines with minimal downtime.

Data from clinical trials showed that patients receiving UroLift implants reported rapid symptomatic improvement, improved urinary flow rates, and sustained sexual function. Patients also experienced a significant improvement in quality of life. Most common adverse events reported include hematuria, dysuria, micturition urgency, pelvic pain, and urge incontinence. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.

The Northwestern Medicine Urology Program ranks amongst the nation's most experienced and well respected, providing comprehensive inpatient and outpatient care, including state-of-the-art diagnostic and treatment capabilities for men, women and adolescents.

About BPH Treatment

More than 500 million aging men worldwide have an enlarged prostate. Medication is often the first line therapy but relief can be inadequate and temporary. Side effects of treatment can include sexual dysfunction, dizziness and headaches, prompting many patients to quit using the drugs. For these patients, the classic alternative is surgery that cuts or ablates prostate tissue to open the blocked urethra. While current surgical options, such as the 'gold standard' surgery, Transurethral Resection of the Prostate (TURP), can be very effective in relieving symptoms, they can also leave patients with permanent side effects such as urinary incontinence, erectile dysfunction and retrograde ejaculation (dry orgasm).

About UroLift

The UroLift System provides an alternative to tissue removing surgery for the treatment of an enlarged prostate. Performed through the urethra, an urologist uses the UroLift System to push aside the obstructive prostate lobes and positions small, tailored permanent UroLift implants to hold the prostate lobes in the retracted position. This opens the urethra while leaving the prostate intact. Adverse reactions associated with UroLift System treatment were comparable to other minimally invasive surgical therapies as well as standard cystoscopy. The most common adverse events reported during the study included pain or burning with urination, blood in the urine, pelvic pain, urgent need to urinate, and the inability to control urine because of an urgent need to urinate. Most symptoms were mild to moderate in severity and resolved within two to four weeks after the procedure.

"Newswise — Women who need breast surgery to remove an abnormality that cannot be felt, also known as a non-palpable breast lesion, now may benefit from the convenience and comfort provided by an advanced new tissue locating technology offered at Rush University Medical Center.

The SAVI SCOUT Radar Localization System helps to decrease the time a woman is in the operating room, increase the success rates of lesion removal and reduce the amount of healthy breast tissue that is removed during the procedure. Rush began offering SAVI SCOUT, which has been used in more than 50 lumpectomy surgeries, in July.

SAVI SCOUT allows a radiologist to insert a radar wave reflector the size of a grain of rice in the patient’s breast up to 30 days before surgery to mark the location of the lesion, as shown with ultrasound or X-ray mammography. The reflector replaces the widespread current practice of inserting a thin, hooked wire into the breast the same day as surgery.

“When there is an abnormality that we can’t feel and are unable to biopsy, we have to find that lesion in surgery,” said Dr. Andrea Madrigrano, assistant professor of surgery at Rush University Medical Center.

SAVI SCOUT replaces a more inconvenient technique used since '70s

Used since the 1970s, a hooked wire is placed in the breast through the skin to the abnormality using ultrasound or X-ray guidance with local anesthesia. The wire is placed into the breast to help guide the surgeon in removing the abnormality later that day.

“Until now, a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast. The woman would then be taken to the operating room area,” Madrigrano said.

Wire localization requires a high degree of coordination between radiology and surgical scheduling, which can lead to delays between placement of the wire and surgery, often requiring a woman to wait long periods of time with the wire in her breast.

“Before surgery, these patients are in a hospital gown and are walking around while this wire is in place, which obviously is less than ideal for the patient,” Madrigrano said.

“The radar reflector is a replacement for the wire and is essentially a little marker. After the patient receives a local anesthetic, it can be placed into the breast using an extremely thin needle under image guidance days or weeks prior to surgery. Because this important step is out of the way in advance, it completely changes the patient’s day of surgery experience.”

Radar can target abnormality within 1 mm, sparing more healthy tissue

Unlike mastectomy, which treats breast cancer by removing an entire breast, lumpectomy surgery — also known as breast-conserving surgery — is used to remove only the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding the tumor. Using the SAVI SCOUT system technology, which emits 50 million radar pulses per second, surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector.

“When Madrigrano told me about it, I thought it was an ingenious idea and I’m glad it was developed,” said Nancy Morrissey, who underwent lumpectomy surgery at Rush in July using the SAVI SCOUT technology. “It made surgery go smoothly, and I didn’t have any pain before or after.

“When the marker was inserted near the lump, it was similar to a biopsy. I was glad it was done a week before and not the same day as the lumpectomy surgery. I have been very impressed with the experience.” According to Cianna Medical, the company that created SAVI SCOUT, 70 percent of women return to work the next day after the SCOUT procedure.

In addition to enhancing the patient’s surgical experience, the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better. That advantage may lead to less tissue needing to be removed and a better appearance of the breast after surgery.

“Ultimately, this wireless technology has the potential to reduce surgical delays, and more importantly will benefit patients by increasing comfort and satisfaction during a stressful time,” Madrigrano said.",1
"Genetic test could help fight secondary breast cancer

New genetic test could benefit thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours

Bone strengthening drugs can help prevent the disease from spreading to the bone

Thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours could benefit from a potential new genetic test.

A study led by researchers at the University of Sheffield has shown women with breast cancer who lack a key genetic marker are more likely to respond to a treatment that can prevent the disease spreading to their bones.

Secondary cancer, known as metastasis, is the most common cause of death in breast cancer patients as there are few effective treatments once it has taken root.

It occurs when cancer cells spread to another site in the body. Around 70 per cent of secondary breast cancer patients have tumours in the bone.

Large scale clinical trials indicate a group of bone strengthening drugs known as bisphosphonates can help prevent the disease from spreading to bone in breast cancer patients if given early enough.

“The difficulty is identifying which patients will benefit from these drugs,” said Professor Robert Coleman, emeritus professor of medical oncology who led the new study. “It only seems to be effective in some patients, particularly older women, while others show no response and in some younger women it may even be harmful.”

The new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, has shown it may be possible to identify women who will benefit from bisphosphonates by using a test that looks for a gene known as MAF. Women who do not carry the gene - approximately 80 per cent of women with breast cancer - were found to benefit from the bone strengthening treatment.

Professor Coleman said: ""If the test is negative for this gene, then they can be offered this bone strengthening treatment, which can give them a better chance of surviving their cancer.”

A test for the gene, known as MAFTest, has been developed by a Spanish medical company called Inbiomotion following work conducted at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) in Barcelona.

The new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, was part of an international phase 3 clinical trial involving 3,360 women with stage II or III breast cancer.

The results need to be confirmed in a second trial, currently underway in the United States, before the test is likely to receive approval for wider use in patients. But if successful, it could be incorporated into the routine testing of breast cancer patients to see if they could benefit from bisphosphonate treatments such as zoledronic acid. Those found not to carry the gene could be given the drug after having surgery and radiotherapy for their primary tumour in an effort to prevent the cancer from spreading.

Around 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 annually.

“The discovery made at IRB Barcelona and tested in the current study could be of great use to clinicians and would avoid unnecessary treatment of patients who would not benefit or could be harmed by the treatment,"" added Professor Roger Gomis, leader of the growth control and cancer metastasis group at IRB Barcelona, who was a co-author on the study.

"Characterized by the World Health Organization as a ""neglected tropical disease,"" leprosy (also known as Hansen's disease) is one of the most ancient diseases known to humankind and is caused by the bacteria Mycobacterium leprae. Nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy, which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage. While drug therapy exists for leprosy, it must be taken for many months, has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection. A viable vaccine to prevent and/or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end.

Scientists at IDRI, along with national and international collaborators including the National Hansen's Disease Program and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, with financial support from American Leprosy Missions, have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities. Based on data generated in preclinical studies, the vaccine candidate, called LepVax, has progressed to Phase I clinical testing in the United States, the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers. The clinical trial is focused on safety, as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine.

""While previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases, this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy, using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve,"" said Steven Reed, Ph.D., IDRI President, CEO & Founder. ""The leprosy vaccine program at IDRI has benefited greatly from what we've learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades. Although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related, leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges. This vaccine represents a unique accomplishment, requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology, and American Leprosy Missions has been there from the beginning."" IDRI scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis, both in clinical stages of development.

""We are thrilled that after 15 years and an investment of over $5.1 million, made possible by our faithful donors and partners, a leprosy-specific vaccine is beginning a Phase I clinical trial,"" says Bill Simmons, President and CEO of American Leprosy Missions. ""We believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi-drug therapy, the current treatment for leprosy, was launched in the 1980s. We look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy. And, it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together. What a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide.""

The vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying M. leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response. IDRI scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins, which is combined with IDRI's proprietary immune-stimulating adjuvant (GLA-SE). With recent developments in vaccine technology, IDRI scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection, meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium.

""This generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research. The development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory,"" Reed explained. ""This is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods.""

Reed added that, without the foresight and support of American Leprosy Missions, there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate. ""The vision and support of American Leprosy Missions has been tremendous as we've worked with them throughout the years, moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine,"" he said. ""The progress we've had to date would not have been possible without American Leprosy Missions' financial support and guidance."" Early results from the Phase I study should be available in 2018, and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later-phase clinical trials should results from the Phase I study (clinical trial NCT03302897) support further evaluation.

The vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy, which will require detection, prevention and treatment. IDRI had developed technology to enable a rapid, affordable, point-of-care diagnostic test, which was funded by NIAID (grant numbers 1R43AI066613-01A1 and 2R44AI066613-02.)

In addition to IDRI and American Leprosy Missions, a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy, including Novartis and the Novartis Foundation. Reed, along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published ""Innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of Mycobacterium leprae"" in The Lancet Infectious Diseases , outlining what is needed to achieve this goal. Together with scientific, government and NGO partners, the Novartis Foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission, while Novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge.

"Multivitamins in pregnancy may be linked to lower autism risk in children

Evidence not yet sufficient to change practice but findings warrant further investigation, say researchers

Taking multivitamins during early pregnancy may be associated with a reduced risk of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) in children compared with mothers who do not take multivitamins, finds a study published in The BMJ today.

The researchers stress that their findings cannot establish cause and effect, but say they raise questions about a possible association that warrant further investigation.

Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) includes a range of conditions, including Asperger syndrome, that affect a person’s social interaction, communication, interests and behaviour. It’s estimated that about 1 in every 100 people in the UK has ASD. More boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls.

Research indicates that ASD most likely develops in the womb and that a mother’s diet during pregnancy could have an influence. But results from previous studies have been inconsistent, suggesting that other unmeasured factors (confounding), such as a mother’s overall health and lifestyle, could also play a role.

So an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of ASD, with and without intellectual disability.

They applied three analytical methods to a sample of 273,107 mother-child pairs living in Stockholm, Sweden. The sample was restricted to children who were 4 to 15 years of age by December 31 2011 and were born between 1996 and 2007.

Women reported their use of folic acid, iron, and multivitamin supplements at their first antenatal visit and cases of child ASD were identified from national registers.

After adjusting for several potentially influencing factors in both mothers and children, the researchers found that multivitamin use, with or without additional iron and/or folic acid, was associated with a lower likelihood of child ASD with intellectual disability relative to mothers who did not use folic acid, iron, and multivitamins.

There was no consistent evidence that either iron or folic acid use were associated with a reduced risk of ASD.

The results of the various analyses seemed to be consistent with each other, say the authors, suggesting that the association between multivitamins and ASD might not be fully explained by confounding.

They point to several study limitations, such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type, timing and dose of supplements. However strengths included the relatively large population-based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings.

“Together, the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with ASD with intellectual disability,” say the authors.

Given the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy, “it is impossible to imagine that these results, on their own, should change current practice,” they write. However, they say these findings “raise questions that warrant investigation” and call for verification in randomised studies “before recommending a change to current practice.”

"Cooling babies deprived of oxygen at birth (perinatal asphyxia) can reduce the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood, according to a new study published in the journal Epilepsia.

The study has been led by Marianne Thoresen, Professor of Neonatal Neuroscience, from the Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences at the University of Bristol.

It is known that newborn babies who suffer perinatal asphyxia may develop permanent brain injury resulting in cerebral palsy or other conditions, like epilepsy. Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition.

The research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age.

The research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs.

The study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care.

Before therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability).

In this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment.

Professor Marianne Thoresen said: ""Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood. Cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally.""

"BOSTON (Sept. 11, 2017)--Adding 48 minutes of moderate exercise per week is associated with improvements in overall physical functioning and decreases in risks of immobility in older adults who are sedentary, finds a new study led by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging (USDA HNRCA) at Tufts University.

In the study, published in PLOS ONE on Aug. 18, the researchers evaluated how different doses of exercise for adults age 70-89 would impact the benefits. While the researchers saw improvements in all participants who added some physical activity to their routine, those who got more exercise saw greater changes. The work is part of the Lifestyle Interventions and Independence for Elders (LIFE) study.

""These are people who want to live healthy, independent lives and are at risk for losing that. Maintaining functional independence for older adults is an important public health issue. In our first LIFE study, we confirmed that regular exercise can help improve physical function and prevent mobility loss. Now we see that small increases can have big impacts,"" said first and corresponding author Roger A. Fielding, senior scientist and director of the Nutrition, Exercise Physiology, and Sarcopenia Laboratory at the USDA HNRCA.

For the LIFE study, the researchers analyzed data from 1,635 men and women age 70-89 over an average of 2.6 years. Half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking-based strength, flexibility and balance training; half participated in health education workshops. All had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than 20 minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study. Participants were evaluated at baseline, six, 12, and 24 months. The researchers relied on movement monitors and self-reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions.

Changes in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through 24 months. There was a continuous, graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least 48 minutes of physical activity per week. The greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss.

""Our goal was to have participants walking up to 150 minutes per week. To see benefits at 48 minutes is encouraging. We wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study, and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe, incremental changes to their activity levels. Reducing muscle loss, functional decline, and loss of independence are important to anyone, at any age, and at any physical ability,"" said Fielding.

The researchers acknowledge limitations of this study, including examining the different quantities of exercise participation achieved in the LIFE study participants and not specifically prescribing different amounts of exercise to different study groups. In addition, there were differences in the measured absolute amounts of exercise performed when comparing objective activity monitoring using a wearable ""device"" and self-report of physical activity.

"OKLAHOMA CITY, Sept. 7, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Arthrokinex announces the release of IRAPjoint™ therapy in the USA. This therapy has recently been highlighted by several professional football players traveling to Europe for treatment. The process works by using one's own blood – specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements – to end or ease pain and chronic injuries.

Recently a well-known Seattle Seahawks player and four of his teammates are sitting out a week of training camp to receive a blood-healing treatment from a European supplier an IRAP-based treatment solution. Other NBA, MLB and NHL superstars have also utilized the treatment.

This treatment was developed by a German physician, Dr. Peter Wehling, in the 1980s. By using one's own blood – specifically the body's own anti-inflammatory proteins and human-growth elements – to end or ease pain and chronic injuries. During the process, blood is drawn from the patient and then injected back into the pained joint.

A European company and their U.S. affiliate started using IRAP to treat joint pain from inflammation in the 1980s; the price reported was $10,000. The European-based process was the inspiration for Dr. Barreto of Oklahoma City, Oklahoma to work on developing a stronger, more effective, and more cost-efficient version in the United States.

After years of development and process optimization, the U.S. product IRAPjoint™ is now ready. Significantly better concentration, healing/pain reduction durability, faster production (just one hour), one-fifth the price, and chemical additive free, IRAPjoint™ is now available in multiple physician practices throughout the United States.

IRAPjoint™ is produced through a single blood draw which is enough for a full year's treatment of up to 12 injections. Typically, the treatment process is painless and just takes a few minutes and consists of one injection per week for three weeks, followed by quarterly injections, as needed. Success has been achieved in knees, hip and shoulder joints.

Finally, a U.S. based company has a solution for America's professional and weekend athletes as well as those struggling with aching or arthritic joints. It's a non-drug, non-surgical treatment derived from your own blood. The cost of the USA-based IRAPjoint™ treatment is $2,000 compared to the reported price of $10,000 for a foreign competitor.

"Historic Discovery Promises to Prevent Miscarriages and Birth Defects Globally

UPDATE;

Click here to read the latest statement from the Victor Chang Institute.



OVERVIEW



One of Australia's greatest discoveries in pregnancy research

Vitamin B3 can potentially treat molecular deficiencies which cause miscarriages and birth defects

Discovery promises to reduce miscarriages and birth defects

Findings expected to change the way pregnant women are cared for

A blockbuster, world first breakthrough at Sydney’s Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute is expected to prevent recurrent miscarriages and multiple types of birth defects, in one of Australia's most significant discoveries in pregnancy research.



Crucially, Australian scientists have also demonstrated a potential cure, in the form of a common dietary supplement.

This historic discovery is expected to forever change the way pregnant women are cared for around the globe. Every year 4.9 million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in Australia. In the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery. Until now.

This breakthrough, led by Professor Sally Dunwoodie from the Victor Chang Institute, has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart, spinal, kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies.



“The ramifications are likely to be huge. This has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world, and I do not use those words lightly,” says Professor Dunwoodie.

The landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule, known as NAD, can prevent a baby’s organs from developing correctly in the womb.

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is one of the most important molecules in all living cells. NAD synthesis is essential for energy production, DNA repair and cell communication. Environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production, which can cause a NAD deficiency.

World first research at the Victor Chang Institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming.

“Now, after 12 years of research, our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin,” Professor Dunwoodie revealed.

At the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin B3, also known as niacin. Scientists at the Victor Chang Institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects.

Vitamin B3 is required to make NAD and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite. However, a recent study[i] found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin B3 in their first trimester, which is the critical time in organ development. By the third trimester, vitamin B3 levels were low in 60% of pregnant women. This indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin B3 than is currently available in most vitamin supplements.

Using a preclinical mouse model, scientists at the Victor Chang Institute investigated the effect of vitamin B3 on developing embryos. The results were astounding.

Before vitamin B3 was introduced into the mother’s diet, embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects. After the dietary change, both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented, with all the offspring born perfectly healthy.

This discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies. As a result, consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide, and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a 70% decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects.

According to the Executive Director of the Victor Chang Cardiac Research Institute, Professor Robert Graham, the implications are profound.

“Just like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida, Professor Dunwoodie’s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin B3 very early on, even before they become pregnant. This could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world,” said Professor Graham.

“We believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country’s greatest medical discoveries. It’s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time. It’s actually a double breakthrough,” said Professor Graham.

The next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure NAD levels. This will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect, and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin B3.

The findings have been released today by the New England Journal of Medicine – the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world. http://www.nejm.org/

This study would not have been possible without the generous support of the Chain Reaction Foundation, the Key Foundation and the National Health and Medical Research Council.

"Newswise — Fresh thyme and oregano offer a savory touch to a tasty dish, but a University of Iowa researcher recently discovered natural compounds in the herbs that may offer a treatment for cachexia or “wasting syndrome” as it is more commonly known.

Wasting syndrome is characterized by a loss of weight and muscle atrophy, and largely found in patients who suffer from cancer, kidney disease, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and heart failure.

In pre-clinical studies, compounds in thyme and oregano have demonstrated a greater than 37 percent increase in exercise tolerance and a 15 percent increase in muscle mass of certain body muscles. The discovery was a “serendipitous finding” in the lab of Rajan Sah, M.D., Ph.D., assistant professor of Internal Medicine and Molecular Physiology and Biophysics at the University of Iowa.

“When we exercise and move our muscles, we activate calcium cycling to cause muscle contraction,” said Sah. “This same calcium signal also activates signaling pathways to increase skeletal muscle endurance and also skeletal muscle size.”

Sah’s research team hypothesized that low level calcium cycling induced by these natural compounds might promote improved exercise capacity and overall metabolic health associated with healthy muscle mass.

“We tested these compounds in sedentary mice and found a dramatic improvement in exercise endurance and a mild increase in muscle size of certain muscle groups,” Sah says.

The intellectual property associated with this discovery was recently licensed by the UI Research Foundation to Innovus Pharma, an over-the-counter consumer goods and specialty pharmaceutical company that commercializes non-prescription medicine and consumer care products. The company plans to develop the discovery into an over-the-counter (OTC) product to combat cachexia.

“The oncology supportive care market is a very large unmet medical market with limited choices to both physicians and patients,” said Bassam Damaj, chief executive officer of Innovus Pharma. “The treatment of cachexia just doesn’t exist. It is a miserable, frequent event that every physician knows about and many patients experience, but there is simply little available against it and nothing to prevent it.”",0

Patients reported improvement in symptoms of eye floaters after treatment with a laser, according to a study published by JAMA Ophthalmology.

Floaters become more prevalent with age and although most patients grow accustomed to them, many find them bothersome, and they can worsen visual quality. Three management options exist for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and the laser procedure, YAG vitreolysis, of which there are limited published studies on its effectiveness for treating floaters.

Chirag P. Shah, M.D., M.P.H., and Jeffrey S. Heier, M.D., of the Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston, randomly assigned 52 patients (52 eyes) to receive YAG laser vitreolysis (n = 36) in one session or a sham (placebo) laser treatment (control; n = 16).

Six months after treatment, the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in self-reported floater-related visual disturbance (54 percent) compared with sham controls (9 percent). A total of 19 patients (53 percent) in the YAG laser group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms vs 0 individuals in the sham group. Several measures of quality of life also improved compared with those in the sham laser group, including general vision and independence. No differences in adverse events between groups were identified.

A limitation of the study was its small sample size and short follow-up period.

“Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,” the authors write.

"Cochlear implants that have electrodes designed without wire perform better than those with wires for long-term hearing preservation, a Mount Sinai researcher has reported in a first-of-its-kind study. The research also determined that the best surgical approach for cochlear implant procedures did not involve drilling into the bone around the ear. The results, published in the June 23, 2017, online edition of The Laryngoscope, may transform how doctors approach cochlear implant procedures to give patients the best possible outcomes.

Cochlear implants help preserve hearing in patients with nerve deafness who cannot benefit from hearing aids. They are surgically placed in the inner ear to convert sound waves into electrical signals that stimulate the auditory nerve to provide hearing.

""This is the largest clinical study done in the world on conventional electrodes and will have major implications for doctors and their patients who need their long-term hearing restored,"" said the study's lead investigator, George Wanna, MD, Site Chair, Department of Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery at New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai (NYEE) and Mount Sinai Beth Israel; Chief, Division of Otology-Neurotology and Director of the Center for Hearing and Balance and Ear Institute at Mount Sinai Health System. ""This study is a breakthrough for patients with hearing loss, and improvements in practice and techniques will allow them to enjoy many hearing benefits such as music enjoyment, listening in complex environments, and sound localization.""

Dr. Wanna and a team of researchers from Vanderbilt University examined roughly 230 patients with every type of cochlear implant, including three FDA-approved implants that use different types of electrodes to stimulate the auditory nerve. They found that electrodes designed with no wire (called lateral wall electrodes) performed the best in maintaining residual hearing in the inner ear, compared to electrodes made with wire. More specifically, the non-wire electrodes were less traumatic, causing less injury and minimizing fractures inside the inner ear. The study found that the actual brand of the electrode did not make a difference; the presence or absence of wire was the only distinguishing factor.

Dr. Wanna and the researchers also looked at the impact of two major surgical approaches used to insert the electrodes in the inner ear: ""round window"" (where surgeons open the membrane without bone removal or drilling in the inner ear) and ""cochleostomy"" (which requires drilling into the bone to get inside the inner ear). They reported that patients who had the round window approach had a much better chance of keeping their residual hearing in the long term.

""The cochleostomy approach causes fibrosis and scarring, leading to hearing loss over time,"" said Dr. Wanna. ""Our results also revealed that using oral steroids also helped in the long term to preserve hearing by preventing inflammation.""

""We hope the findings will help surgeons choose the best implants and approaches for their patients,"" said Dr. Wanna. ""This is an exciting time in this field, and the advancement in hearing technology and continued improvements in techniques and outcomes will benefit patients and their families.""

"MERIDEN, Conn., June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Protein Sciences Corporation announced the publication of clinical trial results comparing Flublok® Quadrivalent – the quadrivalent version of Flublok® influenza vaccine – to a traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. The data published in the June 22nd issue of the New England Journal of Medicine showed that Flublok Quadrivalent provided significantly improved protection against laboratory confirmed influenza illness in older adults.

The publication notes that approximately 9,000 people aged 50 and older were enrolled and randomized in an efficacy study designed to compare Flublok Quadrivalent to a traditional quadrivalent vaccine. People who were given Flublok Quadrivalent were over 40% less likely to develop culture-confirmed influenza. This data satisfies both pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority and superiority of Flublok over the traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. Flublok Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in October 2016 and will be available nationwide in prefilled syringes for the upcoming flu season.

""This study shows that Flublok® Quadrivalent, produced with modern recombinant technology can provide better protection against confirmed influenza-like illness among older adults than standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine produced with traditional technology,"" said Lisa Dunkle MD, Chief Medical Officer of Protein Sciences. ""We demonstrated statistically significantly better protection by Flublok based on considerably fewer people contracting the flu after vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent. Today, we announce that these peer-reviewed results have been published in the highly respected New England Journal of Medicine. Furthermore, physicians are eligible for up to 1 hour AMA PRA category 1 CME credit for reading the article. Clearly, Flublok represents a major step forward in combating influenza on a global scale.""

Flublok is the only flu vaccine made without the use of eggs and therefore is not subject to the mutations that are sometimes introduced into the vaccine during the process of egg adaptation that can cause the traditional vaccines to be ineffective (see Skowronski et al. (2014) PLOS ONE 9(3), e92153). Flublok contains three times more active ingredients than traditional vaccines and produced significantly higher immune responses to the A strains of influenza (especially H3N2) in the Flublok Quadrivalent study. Furthermore, Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only high antigen-content quadrivalent flu vaccine that with its high efficacy makes it ideal for older adults and those with a compromised immune system. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain influenza virus, antibiotics, formaldehyde, preservatives, egg protein, latex, gluten or gelatin unlike other flu vaccines. Flublok Quadrivalent is FDA approved for adults 18 and older.

About Flublok®

Flublok, the world's first recombinant protein-based vaccine for the prevention of seasonal influenza disease, is approved for all adults over 18 years. FDA approved the quadrivalent formulation (""Flublok Quadrivalent"") in October 2016 that will be commercially available for everyone over 18 years for the 2017/18 influenza season. Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain any preservatives (e.g., thimerosal - a form of mercury), egg proteins, gelatin or latex. In addition, Flublok contains three times more antigen than traditional flu vaccines (3x45mcg hemagglutinin protein versus 3x15mcg hemagglutinin protein). In a 2014/15 post-marketing study of 9,000 adults 50 years and older, people who received Flublok were over 40% less likely to develop cell culture confirmed influenza than people who received a traditional flu vaccine. Flublok is an exact copy of the influenza virus coat protein and is not subject to the egg-adapted mutations associated with low vaccine effectiveness (see Skowronski et al. (2014) PLOS ONE 9(3), e92153).

"Newswise — TORONTO, June 20, 2017 – In a Canadian first, a medical team has implanted a wireless device inside a heart failure patient, permitting clinicians to monitor the patient’s cardiovascular status – virtually and in real-time – and proactively adjust treatment to prevent costly, potentially unnecessary hospitalization.

“Heart failure is an epidemic that commonly leads to hospitalization,” says Dr. Heather Ross, scientific lead at the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research and cardiologist, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network. “Hospitalization is often necessary when patients start to retain fluid, develop congestion and experience shortness of breath. This technology is a way to directly measure how much fluid is in a patient, allowing us to intervene before they develop symptoms of congestion, before they end up in hospital. This is a big game-changer.”

Funded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS™ HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. When the patient lies on an accompanying antenna-equipped pillow device, the sensor provides important data – including the patient’s lung pressure readings to clinicians – via a secure website.

“Never before have we had the ability to obtain a patient’s accurate lung pressure data while they are outside the hospital,” said Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. “Traditionally we’ve relied on a patient describing symptoms, and by then they may have already progressed to the point of hospitalization. With this device, we can see warning signs days in advance, and adjust treatment accordingly.”

The most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease in Canada, heart failure affects close to one million Canadians, and an estimated 26 million people globally. In Canada, heart failure patients stay an average of almost 10 days for each hospital admission, accounting for 1.4 million hospital stays a year. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. About one-quarter of these patients return to hospital within three months, while approximately 50 per cent return to hospital within six months.

The CardioMEMS™ HF System is designed to monitor heart failure patients whose condition is serious but who are not so ill that the technology cannot improve their outcome. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months.

Produced by Abbott, the CardioMEMSÔ HF System is approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada.

"STOCKHOLM, June 15, 2017 /PRNewswire/ --

Elekta (EKTA-B.ST) today announced new data demonstrating stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a safe treatment option for early-stage lung cancer patients aged 80 or older. The results, which were based on data from more than 1,000 patients across five institutions that comprise the Elekta Lung Research Group, are available online and will be published in the July 15 print issue of International Journal of Radiation Oncology • Biology • Physics.

The study evaluated safety and efficacy outcomes of 1,083 patient reports collected in a multi-institutional database. Patients were treated with SBRT for early-stage lung cancer between 2004 and 2014 and followed for a median of 1.7 years. The cohort included 305 patients under 70 years of age, 448 patients ages 70 to 79 years, and 330 patients aged 80 years or more (which included 16 patients aged 90 years or more). The median age was 75 years (range 41to 94).

Study results show no significant differences among the three age groups with respect to 2-year local recurrence, regional recurrence, distant metastases or the incidence of grade 3 or higher toxicity. Cause-specific survival was similar among all three age groups (90.3 to 90.6 percent). Two-year overall survival was lower in older patients, which is likely related to other medical issues.

""Older patients are often not considered for radiation therapy due to concerns about their ability to tolerate treatment. The results of our study clearly support the use of SBRT for elderly patients, especially those who may not be able to tolerate longer courses of radiotherapy or more invasive treatment options,"" says Meredith Giuliani, MBBS, FRCPC, MEd, a radiation oncologist in the Cancer Clinical Research Unit at Princess Margaret Cancer Centre, University Health Network in Toronto and lead study author. ""Radiation oncologists need to work closely with our peers in other parts of the medical community to ensure that patients with diagnosed or suspected early-lung cancer are evaluated for potential treatment with SBRT regardless of age.""

""This study is the largest series of its type to evaluate SBRT outcomes in patients aged 80 years and older,"" says Joel Goldwein, MD, Senior Vice President, Medical Affairs for Elekta. ""In addition to providing important support for using SBRT to treat early-stage lung cancer in elderly patients, these findings highlight the value of multi-institutional collaborations and large data sets that can provide statistically meaningful answers to critical questions about treatment outcome and guide clinical decision making.""

The Elekta Lung Research Group (ELRG) is an international collaboration of physicians and physicists that is evaluating clinical outcomes in early-stage non-small cell lung cancer patients. To date, they have accumulated data on close to 1,200 such patients and identified medical and technical factors that affect tumor control and toxicity. Their collective experience is among the largest multinational series of patients treated with image-guided SBRT to date.

The ELRG includes participants from William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Michigan; Princess Margaret Cancer Centre; Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Julius-Maximilians University of Würzburg in Würzburg, Germany; and The Netherlands Cancer Institute-Antoni van Leeuwenhoek hospital in Amsterdam, The Netherlands.

"LA JOLLA, CA – May 29, 2017 – Scientists at The Scripps Research Institute (TSRI) have given new superpowers to a lifesaving antibiotic called vancomycin, an advance that could eliminate the threat of antibiotic-resistant infections for years to come. The researchers, led by Dale Boger, co-chair of TSRI’s Department of Chemistry, discovered a way to structurally modify vancomycin to make an already-powerful version of the antibiotic even more potent.

“Doctors could use this modified form of vancomycin without fear of resistance emerging,” said Boger, whose team announced the finding today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The original form of vancomycin is an ideal starting place for developing better antibiotics. The antibiotic has been prescribed by doctors for 60 years, and bacteria are only now developing resistance to it. This suggests bacteria already have a hard time overcoming vancomycin’s original “mechanism of action,” which works by disrupting how bacteria form cell walls.

Boger called vancomycin “magical” for its proven strength against infections, and previous studies by Boger and his colleagues at TSRI had shown that it is possible to add two modifications to vancomycin to make it even more potent. “With these modifications, you need less of the drug to have the same effect,” Boger said.

The new study shows that scientists can make a third modification—which interferes with a bacterium’s cell wall in a new way—with promising results. Combined with the previous modifications, this alteration gives vancomycin a 1,000-fold increase in activity, meaning doctors would need to use less of the antibiotic to fight infection.

The discovery makes this version of vancomycin the first antibiotic to have three independent mechanisms of action. “This increases the durability of this antibiotic,” said Boger. “Organisms just can’t simultaneously work to find a way around three independent mechanisms of action. Even if they found a solution to one of those, the organisms would still be killed by the other two.”

Tested against Enterococci bacteria, the new version of vancomycin killed both vancomycin-resistant Enterococci and the original forms of Enterococci.

The next step in this research is to design a way to synthesize the modified vancomycin using fewer steps in the lab, as the current method takes 30 steps. But Boger calls this the “easy part” of the project, compared with the challenge of designing the molecule in the first place.

Even if the process isn’t streamlined, Boger believes the new vancomycin’s lifesaving powers make its production valuable. “Antibiotics are total cures for bacterial infections,” said Boger. “Making this molecule is important, even by the current approach, if the failure of antibiotics continues.”

In addition to Boger, authors of the study, “Peripheral modifications of [Ψ[CH2NH]Tpg4]vancomycin with added synergistic mechanisms of action provide durable and potent antibiotics,” included first author Akinori Okano and Nicholas A. Isley, both of TSRI.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health (grants F32 GM114948 and CA041101).

"IRVINE, Calif., May 10, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Proove® Biosciences, Inc. announces a new study validating the accuracy of precision medicine technology to predict prescription opioid abuse. This study, entitled ""Evaluation of a Predictive Algorithm that Detects Aberrant Use of Opioids in an Addiction Treatment Centre"", is published in the peer-reviewed Journal of Addiction Research and Therapy (Impact Factor: 1.4).

Distinguished Fellow American Society of Addiction Medicine (ASAM), Diplomate American Board of Addiction Medicine and Fellow American College of Preventive Medicine, J. Ramsay Farah, MD, MPH, MRO, CPE, led a research team that showed Proove Opioid Risk® identifies patients at risk for Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) with nearly 97% accuracy. This study evaluated 186 patients, comparing 94 Medicaid patients at an addiction treatment facility with confirmed cases of opioid abuse, and 92 healthy patients with no history of opioid use. The receiving operator characteristic (ROC) curve had an area under the curve (AUC) of 0.967. Furthermore, the sensitivity of the ""moderate risk"" cut-off score was 98%, while the specificity of the ""high risk"" score was 100%.

Dr. Farah, who serves as the Chief Medical Officer for the Phoenix Health Center in Hagerstown, prior NE Regional Medical Director for United Healthcare Clinical Services and Director ASAM explains, ""Based on ASAM's definition of addiction, about half of substance abuse is due to genetic factors. This study shows that analyzing genetics with lifestyle and behavioral variables in a predictive algorithm can accurately stratify patient risk.""

Dr. Ashley Brenton, Associate Director of R&D for Proove states, ""This validation study builds on the peer-reviewed evidence supporting Proove Opioid Risk® and its components as an optimal model to predict opioid abuse risk.""

Study author, Gregory A. Smith, M.D, former Director of Pain Management at Harbor UCLA, explains, ""Having used this technology for 6 years, this data provides further evidence that clinicians can use Proove Opioid Risk® for ruling out patients unlikely to exhibit aberrant behaviors, and identifying high-risk patients for alternative therapies.""

"Newswise — Patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) usually have a poor prognosis. In part, this is due to the cancer’s ability to resist anti-androgen therapy. A University of Colorado Cancer Center study published today [May 3] in Oncotarget shows that combining a CPT1A inhibitors with anti-androgen therapy increases the cancer’s sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.

“This is a huge development for men with CRPC that previously did not have many options,” says Isabel Schlaepfer, PhD, CU Cancer Center member, assistant professor in the Division of Medical Oncology and senior author of the study. “There is a critical need for improved therapies for this specific cancer type.”

Most cells use the energy of glucose (sugar). Some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids (fat). Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer’s ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell’s mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways.

“We had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,” explains Schlaepfer.

In fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina. When Schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and anti-androgens in cancer cell lines, they found that the addition of ranolazine to anti-androgen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide.

“This finding may have a huge impact on patients with CRPC that had very few options before,” says Schlaepfer. “Since the drugs are clinically safe, a clinical trial can be designed in patients for whom enzalutamide is prescribed.”",0

There have been two clinical studies showing positive safety and effectiveness of the device in the increase of tear production completed with 145 aqueous deficient dry eye adult patients.

""TrueTear™ represents a technological breakthrough for eye care professionals as it delivers an effective, non-invasive and drug-free way to temporarily increase tear production,"" said David Nicholson, Chief R&D Officer, at Allergan. ""As an innovator in eye care, we are continually looking for new products to offer through our portfolio, and TrueTear™ represents the next step forward.""

The new advancement is an addition to Allergan's current eye care portfolio. Last May, Allergan announced positive results from two pivotal trials for TrueTear™ that showed an increase in tear production upon nasal neurostimulation in adults with aqueous tear deficiency.

""In clinical trials, TrueTear™ demonstrated increased tear production upon stimulation of the nasal cavity,"" said John Sheppard, M.D., M.M. Sc., professor of Ophthalmology, Eastern Virginia Medical School and president of Virginia Eye Consultants. ""Interestingly, neurostimulation has been used as an approach for a wide variety of disorders for more than 30 years. TrueTear™ is the first of its kind to provide a temporary increase in tear production in this way.""

About the Studies

Study 1 is a prospective, randomized, controlled, double-masked, multicenter, cross-over trial in which participants used an active device and two control applications. The primary effectiveness endpoint of increased tear production during intranasal application as measured by Schirmer score compared to both controls was met. Study 2 is a prospective, single-arm, multicenter, open-label clinical trial in which participants used TrueTear™ to stimulate tear production for 180 days. The primary effectiveness endpoint of increased tear production as measured by Schirmer score during application of the device compared with basal Schirmer score at Day 180 was met. Secondary endpoints of increased tear production as measured by Schirmer score during application of the device compared with basal Schirmer score at Days 0, 7, 30 and 90 were also met. The direct clinical benefit of temporarily increasing tear production as a therapy for patients with dry eye disease was not assessed as part of these clinical trials. All device-related adverse events were mild in nature. There were no device-related serious adverse events.

"EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE UNTIL 4 PM ET, April 19, 2017

150-year-old Drug May Provide ‘Off’ Time Relief for People with Advanced Parkinson’s Disease

BOSTON - New research provides evidence that an old drug may provide relief for people with advanced Parkinson’s, according to a study released today that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology’s 69th Annual Meeting in Boston, April 22 to 28, 2017. When it comes to the treatment of Parkinson’s disease, the oral drug levodopa has long been considered the gold standard, improving quality of life and longevity. But as the disease progresses, the effects of the medication can partially wear off more quickly after each dose, leaving people to experience “off” time, which are periods of immobility related to temporary unresponsiveness to medication. Parkinson’s symptoms, such as slowness and muscle rigidity, often make movement difficult. “If a person with Parkinson’s disease can reduce their ‘off’ times, that can have a great impact on their everyday life,” said study author Regina Katzenschlager, MD, of Danube Hospital, affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. “In some patients in the trial, the insecurity of unpredictable periods of incapacity was completely alleviated.” The drug apomorphine, first produced in 1865, was first used to treat advanced Parkinson’s disease in the United States in 1950. Its use grew in the 1990s when European doctors starting using subcutaneous infusions of the drug to treat fluctuations in mobility that could not be controlled by the pills. Despite its use in many countries of the world, high-level evidence from randomized, blinded studies of its effectiveness and safety has up until now been lacking. In this phase III study, researchers recruited 107 people with advanced Parkinson’s disease from 23 centers in seven countries. Participants were randomly selected to receive either apomorphine subcutaneous infusion or a placebo saline infusion. The infusion was administered over a period of 14 to 18 hours each day via a small portable pump similar to the sort used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The study found that those who were given apomorphine had a significantly greater reduction of “off” time than those who were given the placebo infusion, with, on average, 2.5 hours less “off” time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in “off” time. This improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment. At the same time, for those who received apomorphine, there was an increase of “on” time without the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias that are often observed with levodopa. Participants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo. Apomorphine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. “It is our hope that these findings confirming the efficacy of apomorphine infusion will encourage doctors in the United States to offer this treatment to their patients and assess its efficacy in their own clinical practice,” said Katzenschlager. The study was supported by Britannia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., the maker of apomorphine. Learn more about Parkinson’s disease at www.aan.com/patients.

"Newswise — The first laser treatments used to treat skin conditions such as benign vascular birthmarks and port-wine stains were developed more than 40 years ago. Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin.

Laser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients’ and doctors’ eyes. Paul J.D. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate in the MU Division of Food Systems and Bioengineering, devised a system that will not only improve the process, but will be safer for both clinicians and patients.

“The system we developed uses ultrasonic pulsation in conjunction with a clinical laser to alter the properties of skin tissues during the procedure,” Whiteside said. “We’ve named the technique ‘sonoillumination,’ and we’re hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future.”

Whiteside and his team, including adviser, Heather K. Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the MU College of Engineering, tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples. Using various amplitudes and pulses, the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting. Whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on April 9, 2017, at the annual conference of American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS).

“Pork skin samples are very close to human skin samples, so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications,” Hunt said. “‘Sonoillumination’ will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the ASLMS presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it’s commercialized.”

Nicholas Golda, associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the MU School of Medicine, echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology.

“Our goal is to provide patients with safer, more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed,” Golda said. “This new technology may also provide physicians with a safer, more controllable option for treating patients.”

The team co-authored the paper, “Ultrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity,” which recently was accepted for publication by the society’s journal, Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. The sonoillumination research was funded in part by a 2015 Fast Track grant from the University of Missouri System.

The team is in the planning stages of developing a start-up company to commercialize the technique. Products produced by Whiteside and the team highlight the University’s impact on the state’s economic development efforts, including commercialization of research conducted at Mizzou, workforce development and job growth, quality of life improvements for residents, and attracting corporations and businesses to the state. Over the last five years, companies commercializing MU technologies have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and grants to advance their commercialization efforts. In 2016, the Office of Technology Management and Industry Relations reported that Mizzou received $14.9 million in revenue from more than 40 technology licenses.

The MU bioengineering department is jointly affiliated with College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) and the College of Engineering.

"Newswise — Bethesda, Md. (March 23, 2017)—Statin drugs are widely used to manage high cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. But in a new review of more than 50 studies, researchers cite reductions in liver inflammation and improvements in other related factors as reasons why statins make good candidates for treating chronic liver disease. The article is published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology—Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology.

Reducing cholesterol can have a positive effect on many chronic liver disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as in biliary disorders. In some studies, the research team found that statins reduced inflammatory molecules that are typically elevated with liver disease and improved inflammation in the endothelium (cells that line the blood vessels). Statin use may also lead to:• Decreased fibrosis (hardening or scarring of tissue),• Less development of fatty liver,• Slowed or halted spread of hepatitis C virus,• Improvement of portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the liver’s blood vessels), • Destruction of existing liver tumor cells, and • Reduced risk of developing liver cancer.

The researchers acknowledge that statin drugs can contribute to liver damage in some people, but for people with advanced liver disease, “[s]tatins are cost-effective, generally well-tolerated by patients and the benefits of statin treatment in most patients outweigh their potential hepatotoxic risk.”

"Newswise — SEATTLE (March 24, 2017) – The U.S. Food and Drug Administration yesterday granted accelerated approval to the checkpoint inhibitor Bavencio (avelumab) for the treatment of patients with metastatic Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC), including those who have not received prior chemotherapy. Avelumab is the first FDA-approved treatment for metastatic MCC and the first disease that the drug has ever been approved to treat.

A rare and aggressive form of skin cancer, MCC, is 35 times less common than melanoma, but on average, it is about three times more likely to be deadly. Until now, there were no systemic therapies approved by the Food and Drug Administration for this cancer, and no approved therapies once the cancer had spread.

Tom Judd, who lives near Portland, Oregon, knows what it is like to be diagnosed with a deadly cancer for which there is no approved drug. After being diagnosed with MCC in 2013, his cancer jumped from a small pimple on his nose throughout his body, growing until it interfered dangerously with organ function.

By early 2015, the disease had nearly killed him, despite surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. Then he enrolled in a clinical trial and received his first of many infusions of the new immunotherapy drug – avelumab. Within six weeks of that first infusion, more than one-third of the cancer throughout his body was gone, and today, more than 90 percent of his tumor mass has disappeared.

Because of the data from this clinical trial, avelumab (brand name Bavencio) has become the first systemic therapy approved by the FDA for MCC, and the first treatment of any kind approved for metastatic MCC.

Dr. Paul Nghiem, affiliate investigator of the Clinical Research Division at Fred Hutch, and the George F. Odland Endowed Chair in Dermatology at the University of Washington School of Medicine, is a senior investigator on the clinical trial that led to the FDA approval and the senior author on the Lancet Oncology article that preceded the approval. He is a leading expert on MCC and a pioneer of immunotherapy for the disease.

The approval as a first- and second-line therapy “is a really big deal,” said Nghiem. His team foundational work on the role of immune cells in MCC paved the way for immunotherapy trials in the disease, including one he leads of another immunotherapy drug with a similar mechanism of action (Merck’s Keytruda), whose results were published last year and changed the field overnight.

A practicing physician, he treats patients with MCC and other skin cancers at Seattle Cancer Care Alliance, Fred Hutch’s clinical care partner. He is a consultant for EMD Serono Inc. and receives funding from Bristol-Myers Squibb to perform biomarker studies in MCC clinical trials.

"Newswise — SAN FRANCISCO, March 16, 2017—-Patients in their 80s and 90s who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation can be treated safely and effectively with stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT), according to research presented today at the 2017 Multidisciplinary Thoracic Cancers Symposium. The advanced form of radiation therapy (RT) was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population, indicating that SBRT is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment.

While the primary treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumor, some patients may not be able to tolerate surgery due to health status, advanced age or other factors. For these patients, the best curative option is SBRT, a specialized type of external beam RT that uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver extremely targeted radiation to a tumor. This high degree of precision makes SBRT particularly effective at sparing surrounding healthy tissue, which is important for tumor sites near essential organs, such as the heart and lungs. Patients complete SBRT treatment in three to five days, compared with several weeks for conventional RT.

“While multiple studies and trials have established the effectiveness of SBRT for inoperable early-stage lung cancer, one of the common reasons for not giving radiation in older patients is concern about tolerating the treatment and potential side effects,” said Richard J. Cassidy III, MD, lead author of the study and a resident in radiation oncology at Emory University’s Winship Cancer Institute in Atlanta. “The low rates of side effects from SBRT for this elderly population in our study indicate that these concerns should not prevent physicians from considering definitive treatment for their inoperable octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with early stage lung cancer.”

Findings are based on a retrospective analysis of 58 consecutive patients who received definitive lung SBRT across four academic sites within Emory between 2010 and 2015. All patients were age 80 or older at the time of their diagnosis, with a median age of 84.9 years. Forty percent of the tumors were adenocarcinomas, while 29 percent were squamous cell carcinomas and 31 percent did not have a biopsy. Fifty percent of patients who did not have a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer. Researchers used logistic regression and proportional hazard testing to determine the association of patient, tumor and treatment characteristics to compare rates of survival, recurrence and progression and assess the influence of patient and disease characteristics. Recursive partitioning analysis (RPA) was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy.

At two years following definitive SBRT for lung cancer among elderly patients, survival rates were 73 percent for cancer specific survival (CSS) and 57 percent for overall survival (OS). CSS rates were higher for patients who were not active smokers but lower for patients who were older or had a previous lung cancer diagnosis (smoking Hazard Ratio (HR) = 0.14, p = 0.03; age HR = 1.19, p = 0.04; cancer HR = 7.75, p = 0.01). OS rates were higher for patients with higher Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS), which measures a patient’s functional ability to perform ordinary tasks, such as work and self-care (HR = 0.91; p < 0.01). Researchers determined that this metric should be considered when offering SBRT in this elderly population, with certain performance status criterion (i.e., KPS ≥ 75) associated with significantly improved outcomes. Two-year estimates of local control and regional control were 84.5 percent and 71.7 percent, respectively. Local failure was more common among patients with adenocarcinomas (HR = 6.36, p = 0.01) and less common for patients with T1 tumors (HR = 0.20, p < 0.01). Higher KPS scores were associated with lower rates of both local failure (HR = 0.92, p < 0.01) and regional failure (HR = 0.94, p < 0.01). In terms of toxicity, just over one-third of patients (34.5%) experienced radiation pneumonitis of any grade, with only two patients experiencing grade 3+ pneumonitis. Pneumonitis was more frequent among patients who were not actively using ace-inhibitors (Odds Ratio (OR) = 3.49, p = 0.02) and less frequent in smaller tumors (OR = 0.03, p < 0.01).

“Our study, along with other studies, helps to show that SBRT can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it,” said Dr. Cassidy. “Elderly patients, who are otherwise doing well, should not have treatment withheld based solely on concerns about side effects and age.”

Palliative Care Consults for Patients with Advanced Cancers Reduces Hospitalization and Improves Quality of Care

Integration of Palliative Care Improves Many Measures of Quality

Newswise — (NEW YORK — March 15, 2017/Embargoed until March 17, 4:00 pm ET) Cancer patients admitted to the hospital with advanced stages of disease who were referred early to palliative care had decreased health care utilization and increased use of support services following discharge, according to a new study led by researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Published today in the Journal of Oncology Practice, the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in 30-day readmission rates, hospice referral, and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers. This is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service, standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures.

Patients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status, quality of life, and functional ability. The integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use, yet many patients are never offered these services.

“As cancer progresses, patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress,” said Cardinale B. Smith, MD, MSCR, Associate Professor of Medicine (Hematology and Medical Oncology), and of Geriatrics and Palliative Medicine, at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. “Health care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses, with hospital readmission rates as high as 40 percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from 30-50 percent – both measures of poor-quality cancer care.”

To improve the quality of care, researchers at the Icahn School of Medicine developed standardized criteria or “triggers” for palliative care consultation for patients admitted to the cancer unit at The Mount Sinai Hospital. Patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria: advanced solid tumor cancer, prior hospitalization within 30 days, hospitalization for more than 7 days, or active symptoms.

“Care for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute-care hospital wards and intensive care units, or receiving invasive procedures, chemotherapy infusions, and radiographic imaging. Such interventions drive escalating costs and are often directly in conflict with patients’ prior stated wishes,” said Dr. Smith.

Consultation with the palliative care team included establishment of goals of care, advance care plans using standardized communication protocols, transition planning and symptom assessment and treatment using the Edmonton Symptom Assessment Scale (ESAS). The palliative team was composed of one board certified PC physician, one nurse practitioner, one social worker, a chaplain, and one to two trainees.

“Our results highlight the need to adopt this practice at acute care hospitals across the nation,” said Dr. Smith. “Palliative care involvement helps patients understand their prognosis, establish goals of care, and formulate discharge plans in line with those goals, and this study is the first to confirm the impact of using standardized criteria and automatic palliative care consultation on quality of cancer care.”

Co-authors of the study include Kerin Adelson, MD, Division of Hematology/Oncology at Yale University School of Medicine.

"ROCHESTER, Minn. — A new type of blood test may help physicians identify which patients with and without evidence of coronary blockages are at risk for heart attacks and strokes. Even individuals with normal levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL), known as the so-called “bad” cholesterol, but still at risk, seem to be identified, according to Mayo Clinic research being presented at the American College of Cardiology’s 66th Annual Scientific Session.

The test, released commercially by Mayo Medical Laboratories in August 2016, measures blood concentrations of plasma ceramides, a class of lipids that are highly linked to cardiovascular disease processes. The study found that individuals with the highest levels of blood ceramides were found to have a 3- to 4-times greater risk of having a cardiovascular event compared with those with the lowest ceramide score, regardless of their LDL cholesterol level or the presence of a blockage in the heart’s arteries.

“Our research suggests that evaluating ceramide levels in patients who are not at immediate risk for coronary artery disease events may help cardiologists decide who could benefit from proactive and preventive treatment, such as statins, or lifestyle changes to prevent a serious cardiac event down the road,” says Jeff Meeusen, Ph.D., a clinical chemist, co-director of Cardiovascular Laboratory Medicine at Mayo Clinic and the study’s lead author.

According to Dr. Meeusen, ceramides are different than cholesterol, which gathers and causes a clog in the arteries. Ceramides are more active, attracting inflammatory cells and promoting clotting.

In the study, 499 Mayo Clinic patients who were referred for coronary angiography to check for possible artery blockages were included and followed prospectively for approximately eighteen years. Patients were similar in age and with regard to blood pressure, smoking status and high-density lipoprotein (HDL), the “good” cholesterol; excluded were those who had diabetes or a previous heart attack, stroke or procedure to open narrowed coronary arteries. Researchers measured four different types of ceramides in the blood at baseline and combined the values into a 12-point scale. Patients were grouped into four risk categories according to their ceramide levels: low (0–2), intermediate (3–6), moderate (7–9) and high (10–12).

Over the eighteen years, researchers recorded occurrences of heart attack, stroke, revascularization and death. Overall, 5.1 percent of patients had a major cardiovascular event each year. But the risk of having an event became higher as ceramide level increased; for each 1-point increase in the ceramide risk score, the risk rose by 9 percent. The rate of events was double among people with the highest ceramide score compared with those with the lowest (8.1 vs. 4.1 percent, respectively).

In patients without coronary artery disease following angiography, the rate of cardiovascular events was only 3.1 percent, lower than the average overall. But when researchers examined cardiovascular disease in this population by ceramide scores, people with the highest levels of ceramides were four times more likely to have an event compared with those with the lowest (7.8 vs. 2.2 percent, respectively). A similar trend was seen among people with low LDL levels (<100 mg/dL), typically considered a good LDL target. In this group, the rate of heart attack, stroke and revascularization and death was 3.7 percent among those with a low ceramide score, but 16.4 percent in people with the highest ceramide levels.

“There is a need to identify patients at increased risk for cardiovascular events so that we can test strategies to prevent those events. This test seems to provide such information,” says Allan S. Jaffe, M.D., senior author of the study, cardiologist at Mayo Clinic and chair of the Division of Clinical Core Laboratory Services.

The trial was funded by Mayo Clinic. The new test is available to health care providers worldwide through Mayo Medical Laboratories, which offers laboratory testing and pathology services to more than 4,000 health care organizations in more than 70 countries. Mayo Medical Laboratories collaborated with some of the original researchers who established the role of ceramides in cardiovascular disease and Zora Biosciences Oy, a diagnostics discovery company based in Finland, to develop and refine the test. The present study is also the first to test its clinical utility in a U.S. population.

"For Immediate Release: March 03, 2017

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Noctiva (desmopressin acetate) nasal spray for adults who awaken at least two times per night to urinate due to a condition known as nocturnal polyuria (overproduction of urine during the night). Noctiva is the first FDA-approved treatment for this condition.

“Today’s approval provides adults who overproduce urine at night with the first FDA-approved therapeutic option to help reduce the number of times a night they wake up to urinate,” said Hylton V. Joffe, M.D., M.M.Sc., director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “It is important to know that Noctiva is not approved for all causes of night-time urination, so patients should discuss their symptoms with their health care provider who can determine the underlying cause of the night-time urination and whether Noctiva is right for them.”

Nocturia (wakening at night to urinate) is a symptom that can be caused by a wide variety of conditions, such as congestive heart failure, poorly controlled diabetes mellitus, medications, or diseases of the bladder or prostate. Before considering Noctiva, health care providers should evaluate each patient for possible causes for the nocturia, and optimize the treatment of underlying conditions that may be contributing to the night-time urination. Because Noctiva is approved only for adults with nocturia caused by nocturnal polyuria, health care providers should confirm overproduction of urine at night with a 24-hour urine collection, if one has not been obtained previously. Health care providers should also be mindful of underlying conditions that can cause nocturia, but that make treatment with Noctiva unsafe, such as excessive drinking of fluids or symptomatic congestive heart failure.

Noctiva is taken daily, approximately 30 minutes before going to bed. It works by increasing the absorption of water through the kidneys, which leads to less urine production.

Noctiva’s efficacy was established in two 12-week, randomized, placebo-controlled trials in 1,045 patients 50 years of age and older with nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria. Although these trials showed a small reduction in the average number of night-time urinations with Noctiva compared to placebo, more patients treated with Noctiva were able to at least halve their number of night-time urinations, and patients treated with Noctiva had more nights with one or fewer night-time urinations.

Noctiva is being approved with a boxed warning and a Medication Guide because it can cause low sodium levels in the blood (hyponatremia). Severe hyponatremia can be life-threatening if it is not promptly diagnosed and treated, leading to seizures, coma, respiratory arrest or death. Health care providers should make sure the patient’s sodium level is normal before starting Noctiva, and should check sodium levels within one week and approximately one month after starting treatment and periodically thereafter. The lower Noctiva dose is recommended as the starting dose for those who may be at risk for hyponatremia, such as the elderly. Noctiva should not be used in patients at increased risk of severe hyponatremia, such as those with excessive fluid intake, those who have illnesses that can cause fluid or electrolyte imbalances, certain patients with kidney damage, and in those using certain medicines, known as loop diuretics or glucocorticoids.

Noctiva should also not be used in patients with symptomatic congestive heart failure or uncontrolled hypertension because fluid retention can worsen these underlying conditions. Use of Noctiva should be discontinued temporarily in patients with certain nasal conditions such as colds or allergies until those conditions have resolved.

Noctiva is also not recommended for the treatment of nocturia in pregnant women. Nocturia is usually related to normal changes in pregnancy that do not require treatment with Noctiva. Noctiva should not be used in children.

The most common side effects of Noctiva in clinical trials included nasal discomfort, cold symptoms (nasopharyngitis), nasal congestion, sneezing, high or increased blood pressure, back pain, nose bleeds, bronchitis and dizziness.

Although there are other FDA-approved medications that also contain desmopressin, none of those medications are approved to treat nocturia.

Noctiva is manufactured by Renaissance Lakewood, LLC for Milford, Pennsylvania-based Serenity Pharmaceuticals, LLC.

"MADISON, Wis., March 1, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- A study from Exact Sciences Corp. (Nasdaq: EXAS) and Mayo Clinic released today by the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) shows promise for the development of a blood-based lung cancer test. Researchers conducted a multi-round study of nearly 400 patients, which demonstrated high accuracy for detecting lung cancer at all stages.

""These results reveal an opportunity to detect lung cancer from a simple blood draw,"" said Kevin Conroy, chairman and CEO of Exact Sciences. ""Our collaboration with Mayo Clinic is efficiently identifying biomarkers for additional cancer applications on the same technology platform as Cologuard.""

AACR released an abstract of the study today, ahead of the presentation of the results on April 2, 2017, during the AACR 2017 annual meeting. The findings from the study of 398 patients (311 controls and 87 cancers) demonstrate that biomarkers in plasma achieved high accuracy for all types and stages of lung cancer. Using two independent regression modeling approaches, a panel of four novel methylated DNA markers demonstrated a sensitivity of 91-96 percent at a specificity of 90-94 percent.

""More studies are needed to corroborate accuracy, however, this plasma DNA test approach appears to be a promising new method and may serve as a rational follow-up to the common findings of lung nodules on CT scanning and may have application in screening for lung cancer,"" said David E. Midthun, M.D. a pulmonologist at Mayo Clinic.

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality, resulting in 1.7 million deaths globally and more than 150,000 deaths in the United States every year. Most symptoms present in the late stages of the disease, when the survival rate is only four percent. Early detection of lung cancer offers the opportunity to reduce mortality. Lung cancer screening is approved for smokers using chest CT scanning. This approach has a sensitivity for lung cancer above 90 percent, but its specificity may fall below 75 percent (a false positive rate of more than 25 percent) because indeterminate lung nodules are so common. Evaluation of these false-positives leads to unnecessary, costly and potentially harmful procedures.

""A blood-based test may help guide next steps after a scan reveals an indeterminate nodule,"" Mr. Conroy said. ""For example, a positive blood test might suggest the need for a biopsy or surgery. In contrast, a negative test might suggest a less aggressive approach. Such a test could offer the opportunity to significantly improve health outcomes and reduce the financial impact on the health care system.""

The abstract is available here.

A poster presentation of the findings will take place Sunday, April 2, 2017, from 1 p.m. to 5 p.m. EDT at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center in Washington, D.C., Halls A-C, Poster Section 30.

"Newswise — ARLINGTON, Va., March 1, 2017 – Results from a new prospective clinical trial indicate that high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy administered in a single, 19 Gray (Gy) treatment may be a safe and effective alternative to longer courses of HDR treatment for men with localized prostate cancer. The study is available online in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology ● Biology ● Physics, the flagship journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO).

With brachytherapy, also known as internal radiation therapy (RT), implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue. Reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate, which is surrounded by multiple critical structures. In contrast to low-dose-rate (LDR) brachytherapy, where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months, HDR treatments deposit the dose in one treatment, after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient.

Typically, HDR brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions, which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants. While the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session, data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited. In this study, researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of 19 Gy HDR brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with LDR brachytherapy, but with the convenience of a single visit.

“It is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure,” said lead study author Daniel J. Krauss, MD, a radiation oncologist at Oakland University’s William Beaumont School of Medicine in Royal Oak, Michigan. “We found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects.”

The study, which appeared in the Red Journal’s January 2017 issue, presented the results of a nonrandomized, prospective clinical trial of 58 patients with low- or intermediate-risk (non-metastatic) prostate cancer, with a median follow-up period of 2.9 years. All patients received a single, 19 Gy fraction of HDR brachytherapy. The median patient age was 63 years (range 43-73), and 91 percent of the patients presented with stage T1 disease.

At an average of nearly three years following treatment, cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable. Three patients experienced recurrence or progression, yielding an estimated three-year cumulative biochemical control rate of 93 percent. Within the six months following HDR therapy, seven patients (12.1%) experienced grade 2 urinary side effects, most commonly frequency/urgency (6.9%). No patients experienced short-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 2+ gastrointestinal (GI) toxicity. Rates were similarly modest for long-term side effects. Six patients (10.3%) experienced chronic grade 2 urinary toxicity and one patient (1.7%) experienced grade 3 chronic GI toxicity that subsequently resolved. No patients experienced long-term grade 3+ urinary toxicity or grade 4 GI toxicity.

“This study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration,” said Dr. Krauss. “Giving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate—meaning the bladder, urethra and rectum—but this was not found to be the case. Toxicity rates were extremely low, with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of 58 patients.”

While findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of HDR brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer, the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow-up to compare long-term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches, which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the 19 Gy dose used in this trial.

“As the follow-up interval lengthens, 19 Gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards. One thing that this study has made clear, however, is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials,” said Dr. Krauss. “While additional study and longer follow-up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single-fraction HDR brachytherapy, we are optimistic that the single-treatment approach can eventually become a standard practice for prostate cancer treatment.”

"Newswise — Hospitals can improve patient care and reduce costs associated with coronary angioplasty if cardiologists perform more of these procedures through an artery in the wrist and if they take steps to discharge such patients on the same day, according to a new study led by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis.

Coronary angioplasty is a procedure in which arteries are opened to increase blood flow to the heart.

The research, published Feb. 20 in JACC: Cardiovascular Interventions, suggests that the lower costs of the wrist approach largely are due to the fact that patients experience fewer complications and can be discharged earlier, compared with procedures that access the heart through the larger, deeper artery in the groin. The researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by 30 percent to the wrist approach, along with same-day discharge, could save the United States $300 million per year.

“We have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the heart’s coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin,” said first author Amit P. Amin, MD, an assistant professor of medicine. “The femoral artery is the traditional route, but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist, we see less bleeding, fewer complications, less pain and discomfort, higher patient satisfaction, shorter hospital stays, and lower costs.”

Patients may undergo coronary angioplasty — also called percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) — to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath. Such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced. Interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin, which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery, deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section, and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open.

Using the National Cardiovascular Data Registry CathPCI Registry, the researchers analyzed data from almost 280,000 Medicare patients who underwent PCI and were eligible for same-day discharge. Despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures, only about 5 percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight.

“We have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day,” said Amin, who treats patients at Barnes-Jewish Hospital. “We use risk-prediction models to predict their risks ahead of time, and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a same-day discharge. This is really about patient care. We want to outline health-care pathways that provide the best care for patients.”

The analysis demonstrated an average cost of $13,389 for the wrist approach with same-day discharge, compared with $17,076 for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization, resulting in a cost savings of about $3,700 for outpatients who get the wrist-access procedure. Independent of the length of stay, the wrist approach costs about $900 less than the groin approach, on average.

The investigators estimated that if a hospital performing 1,000 of these procedures annually shifted 30 percent of these patients to the wrist-access with same-day discharge approach, the hospital would save $1 million over that period. Expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the United States $300 million in health-care spending per year. Health-care costs for the 600,000 patients who receive PCI each year in the U.S. are estimated to be $10 billion.

Of the study’s patient population receiving PCI, 9 percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access. According to Amin, improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries, even for complex cases, and should be considered for more patients.

“The traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart,” Amin said. “Unfortunately, that artery is also deep. It’s associated with more bleeding complications. In contrast, the wrist artery is small and is associated with fewer complications. The minor challenge is in the difficulty of navigating a smaller, more twisting path of an artery through the wrist. But with advances we have in technology and equipment, those challenges are rapidly decreasing.”

"For Immediate Release: February 15, 2017

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Siliq (brodalumab) to treat adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis. Siliq is administered as an injection.

Siliq is intended for patients who are candidates for systemic therapy (treatment using substances that travel through the bloodstream, after being taken by mouth or injected) or phototherapy (ultraviolet light treatment) and have failed to respond, or have stopped responding to other systemic therapies.

""Moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, and today’s approval provides patients with another treatment option for their psoriasis,"" said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Patients and their health care providers should discuss the benefits and risks of Siliq before considering treatment.""

Psoriasis is a skin condition that causes patches of skin redness and flaking. Psoriasis is an autoimmune disorder that occurs more commonly in patients with a family history of the disease, and most often begins in people between the ages of 15 and 35. The most common form of psoriasis is plaque psoriasis, in which patients develop thick, red skin with flaky, silver-white scales.

Siliq’s active ingredient (brodalumab) binds to a protein that causes inflammation, inhibiting the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of plaque psoriasis.

Siliq’s safety and efficacy were established in three randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 4,373 adult participants with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis who were candidates for systemic therapy or phototherapy. More patients treated with Siliq compared to placebo had skin that was clear or almost clear, as assessed by scoring of the extent, nature and severity of psoriatic changes of the skin.

Suicidal ideation and behavior, including completed suicides, have occurred in patients treated with Siliq during clinical trials. Siliq users with a history of suicidality or depression had an increased incidence of suicidal ideation and behavior compared to users without this history. A causal association between treatment with Siliq and increased risk of suicidal ideation and behavior has not been established.

Because of the observed risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, the labeling for Siliq includes a Boxed Warning and the drug is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Siliq REMS Program. Notable requirements of the Siliq REMS Program include the following:

Prescribers must be certified with the program and counsel patients about this risk. Patients with new or worsening symptoms of depression or suicidality should be referred to a mental health professional, as appropriate.

Patients must sign a Patient-Prescriber Agreement Form and be made aware of the need to seek medical attention should they experience new or worsening suicidal thoughts or behavior, feelings of depression, anxiety or other mood changes.

Pharmacies must be certified with the program and must only dispense to patients who are authorized to receive Siliq.

Siliq is also approved with a Medication Guide to inform patients of the risk of suicidal ideation and behavior, and that because Siliq is a medication that affects the immune system, patients may have a greater risk of getting an infection, or an allergic or autoimmune condition. Patients with Crohn’s disease should not use Siliq. Health care providers should also evaluate patients for tuberculosis (TB) infection prior to initiating treatment with Siliq. Health care providers should not administer Siliq to patients with active TB infection, and should avoid immunizations with live vaccines in patients being treated with Siliq.

The most common adverse reactions reported with the use of Siliq include joint pain (arthralgia), headache, fatigue, diarrhea, throat pain (oropharyngeal pain), nausea, muscle pain (myalgia), injection site reactions, influenza, low white blood cell count (neutropenia) and fungal (tinea) infections.

Siliq is marketed by Bridgewater, New Jersey-based Valeant Pharmaceuticals.

"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Feb. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the FOURIER trial evaluating whether Repatha® (evolocumab) reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization) and the key secondary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke). No new safety issues were observed.

The EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial conducted in FOURIER patients also achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that Repatha was non-inferior to placebo for the effect on cognitive function.

Detailed results from the Repatha FOURIER outcomes trial will be presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 66th Annual Scientific Session Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session in Washington, D.C. on Friday, March 17 at 8 a.m. ET. Detailed results from the Repatha EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial will be presented at the Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session on Saturday, March 18 at 8 a.m. ET.

""In the GLAGOV study, we demonstrated that Repatha has an effect on atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. These FOURIER results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,"" said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Cardiovascular disease remains the number one health burden in the world, and we look forward to sharing these outcomes data with the scientific community at the ACC 66th Annual Scientific Session.""

FOURIER ( F urther Cardiovascular OU tcomes R esearch with PCSK9 I nhibition in Subjects with E levated R isk) is a multinational Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 27,500 patients who had either an MI, an ischemic stroke or symptomatic peripheral artery disease and an LDL ≥70 mg/dL or a non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. Patients were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly. The study continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary MACE (major adverse cardiac event) endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke, whichever occured first.

EBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. Executive function (Spatial Working Memory strategy index – primary endpoint) and secondary endpoints of working memory, memory function, and psychomotor speed were assessed using a tablet-based tool (CANTAB) at baseline and select time points.

Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.1 In the U.S., there are approximately 11 million people with ASCVD and/or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who have uncontrolled levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) over 70 mg/dL, despite treatment with statins or other cholesterol-lowering therapies.2,3 More than 60 percent of high-risk patients in Europe are still unable to adequately lower their LDL-C levels with statins or other currently approved lipid-lowering agents.4 Among very high-risk patients, the percentage is increased to more than 80 percent.4 It is estimated that less than one percent of people with FH (heterozygous and homozygous forms) in most countries are diagnosed.5

FOURIER Study Design

FOURIER, a multinational Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is designed to evaluate whether treatment with Repatha in combination with statin therapy compared to placebo plus statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events. The primary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke.

Eligible patients with high cholesterol (LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] ≥100 mg/dL) and clinically evident ASCVD at more than 1,300 study locations around the world were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly plus effective statin dose; or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly plus effective statin dose. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. The study was event driven and continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary endpoint.

EBBINGHAUS Study Design

EBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. The primary endpoint in the study is the Spatial Working Memory strategy index of executive function. Secondary endpoints are working memory, as assessed by the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test between-errors score; memory function, as assessed by the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test; and psychomotor speed, as assessed by the CANTAB Reaction Time (RTI) test.

About Repatha® (evolocumab)

Repatha® (evolocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.6

Repatha is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending.

Important U.S. Product Information

Repatha® is indicated as an adjunct to diet and:

Maximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C)

Other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C

The effect of Repatha® on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined.

The safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old.

The safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH.

Important U.S. Safety Information

Contraindication: Repatha® is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha®.

Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha®, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha®, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve.

Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of Repatha®-treated patients and more common than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions.

In a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha®-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to Repatha® treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively).

Adverse reactions from a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials:

Local injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in Repatha® -treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively.

Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%).

Neurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in Repatha®-treated and placebo-treated patients.

In a pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1,988 patients treated with Repatha® had at least one LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and Repatha® dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by Repatha® are unknown.

Musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 14.3% of Repatha® -treated patients and 12.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than placebo were back pain (3.2% versus 2.9% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), arthralgia (2.3% versus 2.2%), and myalgia (2.0% versus 1.8%).

Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): In 49 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia studied in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 33 patients received 420 mg of

Repatha® subcutaneously once monthly. The adverse reactions that occurred in at least 2 (6.1%) Repatha®-treated patients and more frequently than in placebo-treated patients, included upper respiratory tract infection (9.1% versus 6.3%), influenza (9.1% versus 0%), gastroenteritis (6.1% versus 0%), and nasopharyngitis (6.1% versus 0%).

Immunogenicity: Repatha® is a human monoclonal antibody. As with all therapeutic proteins, there is a potential for immunogenicity with Repatha®.

"Stem cell transplants may induce long-term remission of multiple sclerosis

Encouraging results help set stage for larger studies.

New clinical trial results provide evidence that high-dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by transplantation of a person's own blood-forming stem cells can induce sustained remission of relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis (MS), an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system.

“...these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS.”

Five years after receiving the treatment, called high-dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant (HDIT/HCT), 69 percent of trial participants had survived without experiencing progression of disability, relapse of MS symptoms or new brain lesions. Notably, participants did not take any MS medications after receiving HDIT/HCT. Other studies have indicated that currently available MS drugs have lower success rates.

The trial, called HALT-MS, was sponsored by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (NIAID), part of the National Institutes of Health, and conducted by the NIAID-funded Immune Tolerance Network (ITN). The researchers published three-year results from the study in December 2014, and the final five-year results appear online Feb. 1 in Neurology, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology.

“These extended findings suggest that one-time treatment with HDIT/HCT may be substantially more effective than long-term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of MS,” said NIAID Director Anthony S. Fauci, M.D. “These encouraging results support the development of a large, randomized trial to directly compare HDIT/HCT to standard of care for this often-debilitating disease.”

MS symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties, weakness, fatigue and chronic pain. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting MS, which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare-ups or relapses. Over years, the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form.

In HALT-MS, researchers tested the safety, efficacy and durability of HDIT/HCT in 24 volunteers aged 26 to 52 years with relapsing-remitting MS who, despite taking clinically available medications, experienced active inflammation, evidenced by frequent severe relapses, and worsened neurological disability.

The experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease-causing cells and resetting the immune system. During the procedure, doctors collect a participant’s blood-forming stem cells, give the participant high-dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system, and return the participant’s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system. The treatment carries some risks, and many participants experienced the expected side effects of HDIT/HCT, such as infections. Three participants died during the study; none of the deaths were related to the study treatment.

Five years after HDIT/HCT, most trial participants remained in remission, and their MS had stabilized. In addition, some participants showed improvements, such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities.

“Although further evaluation of the benefits and risks of HDIT/HCT is needed, these five-year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long-term, sustained remissions of poor-prognosis relapsing-remitting MS,” said Richard Nash, M.D., of Colorado Blood Cancer Institute and Presbyterian-St. Luke’s Hospital. Dr. Nash served as principal investigator of the HALT-MS study.

“If these findings are confirmed in larger studies, HDIT/HCT may become a potential therapeutic option for patients with active relapsing-remitting MS, particularly those who do not respond to existing therapies,” said Daniel Rotrosen, M.D., director of NIAID’s Division of Allergy, Immunology and Transplantation.

This work was sponsored by NIAID, NIH, and conducted by the ITN under award number AI109565 and NIAID-funded statistical and clinical coordinating centers under award number AI117870. The ClinicalTrials.gov identifier for the Phase 2 study High-Dose Immunosuppression and Autologous Transplantation for Multiple Sclerosis (HALT-MS) is NCT00288626.

NIAID conducts and supports research — at NIH, throughout the United States, and worldwide — to study the causes of infectious and immune-mediated diseases, and to develop better means of preventing, diagnosing and treating these illnesses.

"For Immediate Release: January 19, 2017

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Trulance (plecanatide) for the treatment of Chronic Idiopathic Constipation (CIC) in adult patients.

“No one medication works for all patients suffering from chronic gastrointestinal disorders,” said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “With the availability of new therapies, patients and their doctors can select the most appropriate treatment for their condition.”

According to the National Institutes of Health, an estimated 42 million people are affected by constipation. Chronic idiopathic constipation is a diagnosis given to those who experience persistent constipation and for whom there is no structural or biochemical explanation.

Trulance, taken orally once daily, works locally in the upper GI tract to stimulate secretion of intestinal fluid and support regular bowel function.

The safety and efficacy of Trulance were established in two 12-week, placebo-controlled trials including 1,775 adult participants. Participants were randomly assigned to receive a placebo or Trulance, once daily. Participants in the trials were required to have been diagnosed with constipation at least six months prior to the study onset and to have less than three defecations per week in the previous three months, as well as other symptoms associated with constipation. Participants receiving Trulance were more likely to experience improvement in the frequency of complete spontaneous bowel movements than those receiving placebo, and also had improvements in stool frequency and consistency and straining.

Trulance should not be used in children less than six years of age due to the risk of serious dehydration. Trulance should be avoided in patients six years of age to 18 years of age. The safety and effectiveness of Trulance have not been established in patients less than 18 years of age. Trulance should not be used in patients with known or suspected mechanical gastrointestinal obstruction.

The most common and serious side effects of Trulance was diarrhea. Patients may experience severe diarrhea. If severe diarrhea occurs, patients should stop taking Trulance and contact their health care provider.

Trulance is manufactured by New York, New York-based Synergy Pharmaceuticals Inc.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

"Newswise — Lap band surgery has significant benefits for severely obese teenagers and, despite its controversial nature, should still be considered as a first option to manage obesity during adolescence, a new study has found.

Led by University of Adelaide researchers, in collaboration with Flinders Medical Centre, and published in the journal Obesity Surgery, the study is the first to show medium to long-term follow-up (3-5 years) of lap band surgery in Australian adolescents.

The research followed 21 severely obese teenagers between 14 and 18 years who had Laparoscopic Adjustable Gastric Banding (lap band surgery) in the South Australian Health Service.

Severe obesity is associated with serious physical and psychological conditions affecting quality of life. Australian revised National Health and Medical Research Council guidelines for obesity management say that lap band surgery should be considered in adolescents with severe obesity – that is with a body mass index (BMI) over 40 kg/m2 or over 35 kg/m2 (weight/height2) with the presence of obesity-related diseases and who don’t respond to medical treatment. However there is no data available in Australian adolescents beyond 24 months post-surgery.

“We are talking about a group of adolescents with severe obesity and significant health and psychological problems related to their increased weight – this is not for everyone,” says corresponding author and Paediatric Endocrinologist Dr Alexia Peña, who is a Senior Lecturer with the University of Adelaide’s Robinson Research Institute.

The study found that weight and BMI improved significantly at all follow-up times following surgery from three months through to 45 months and, in some cases, as long as five years. BMI loss was between 7.1 and 14.7 kg/m2.

“The median BMI reduction of 10 kg/m2 with the lap band is a good result when compared to BMI reduction using the few medications available or lifestyle measures, which is around 1-3 kg/m2,” says Dr Peña. “Lap band surgery is reversible and allows time for adolescents to mature to make a more informed decision on a permanent surgical procedure if required later on in life. This is not the case for other surgeries currently offered for obesity management.

“It is also important that teenagers undergoing this surgery have access to an experienced surgeon as part of a multidisciplinary paediatric team of doctors and Health professionals to ensure there is long-term regular follow-up.”

Paediatric surgeon Mr Sanjeev Khurana, who did all the lap band surgeries between 2009 and 2013, says lap band surgery is a reversible surgical procedure that can be safely used in teens with severe obesity.

“Although gastric banding has been controversial and is currently less used in adults with severe obesity, lap band surgery is one of the most studied surgeries for obesity management, has a high safety record and can be a temporary option to manage severe obesity during adolescence,” says Mr Khurana, who is also a Senior Lecturer in the University of Adelaide’s Discipline of Paediatrics.

“Our findings support lap band surgery as a safe and effective option for management of adolescents with severe obesity – provided it is performed by an experienced surgeon and managed afterwards in a paediatric multidisciplinary environment with regular follow-up until adulthood.”

"- Shows Efficacy at 12 Weeks of Treatment

- Sun Pharma is Developing Seciera™ for Global Markets

Sun Pharma announced successful Phase 3 confirmatory clinical trial results for Seciera™ (cyclosporine A, 0.09% ophthalmic solution), for the treatment of dry eye disease. Seciera™ is a patented, novel, proprietary nanomicellar formulation of cyclosporine A 0.09%. It is a clear, preservative-free, aqueous solution. Seciera™ is being developed by Ocular Technologies, a company recently acquired by Sun Pharma. Following this acquisition, Sun Pharma owns exclusive, worldwide rights to Seciera™ and is developing it to commercialize for global markets including US, Europe, and Japan, as well as several emerging markets.

(Logo: http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160711/813488 )



In this 12 week, multicenter, randomized, double-masked, vehicle controlled Phase 3 confirmatory study, 744 dry eye patients were treated either with Seciera™, or its vehicle. After 12 weeks of treatment, as compared to vehicle, Seciera™ showed statistically significant improvement in the primary end point, Schirmer's score (a measurement of tear production) (p<0.0001). The demonstration of efficacy by Seciera™ at 12 weeks is earlier than other drugs approved for dry eye in the same class.[1] Additionally, several key secondary endpoints showed statistically significant improvements compared to vehicle with some showing an even earlier onset of action. Adverse events reported in the trial were mild to moderate in nature and similar to other approved drugs in the category.[1]-[3] As Sun continues to analyze the data, additional significant findings will be shared at upcoming medical conferences.

Previously, in a completed Phase 2b/3 clinical trial in 455 patients, Seciera™ demonstrated a rapid onset of action and was well tolerated by the study population. Based on published data, the efficacy and safety endpoints in these trials compared favorably to other formulations of cyclosporine A with the advantage of early onset.[1]

According to Dilip Shanghvi, Managing Director, Sun Pharma, ""We are happy to see the early onset of action and strong efficacy results for Seciera™. These results are highly encouraging for millions of Dry Eye patients[4]-[6] across the globe that have yet to find relief for their condition. We look forward to discussing these results with US FDA and agree on next steps for the program.""

""I am very excited to see these strong results for Seciera™,"" noted Dr. Joseph Tauber, Study Investigator and founder of the Tauber Eye Center, Kansas City, Missouri. ""As a clinician who specializes in diagnosing and treating dry eye, this novel formulation of cyclosporine A would be a unique and welcome addition to our armamentarium to treat these patients"".

Jerry St. Peter, Vice President and Head of Sun Ophthalmics, added: ""A key strategic imperative for our ophthalmic business is to participate in the rapidly growing, underserved, and dynamic Dry Eye market, which is expected to reach $5 billion by 2020.[7] Based on this successful confirmatory Phase 3 trial, Seciera™ has the potential to strengthen our emerging ophthalmics pipeline, which includes the recent launch of BromSite™ and late stage development programs for Xelpros™ and DexaSite™.""

"Newswise — Human papillomavirus-positive oropharynx cancers (cancers of the tonsils and back of the throat) are on rise. After radiation treatment, patients often experience severe, lifelong swallowing, eating, and nutritional issues. However, new clinical trial research shows reducing radiation for some patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas can maintain high cure rates while sparing some of these late toxicities.

“We found there are some patients have very high cure rates with reduced doses of radiation,” said Barbara Burtness, MD, Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology), Yale Cancer Center, Disease Research Team Leader for the Head and Neck Cancers Program at Smilow Cancer Hospital, and the chair of the ECOG-ACRIN head and neck committee. “Radiation dose reduction resulted in significantly improved swallowing and nutritional status,” she said.

The study, published in the December 26 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, showed that patients treated with reduced radiation had less difficulty swallowing solids (40 percent versus 89 percent of patients treated with standard doses of radiation) or impaired nutrition (10 percent versus 44 percent of patients treated with regular doses of radiation).

“Today, many younger patients are presenting with HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx,” said Dr. Burtness. “And while traditional chemoradiation has demonstrated good tumor control and survival rates for patients, too often they encounter unpleasant outcomes that can include difficulty swallowing solid foods, impaired nutrition, aspiration and feeding tube dependence,” said Dr. Burtness. “Younger patients may have to deal with these side effects for decades after cancer treatment. We want to help improve our patients’ quality of life.”

The study included 80 patients from 16 ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group sites who had stage three or four HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, and were candidates for surgery. Eligible patients received three courses of induction chemotherapy with the drugs cisplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab. Patients with good clinical response then received reduced radiation.

Study results also showed that patients who had a history of smoking less than 10 packs of cigarettes a year had a very high disease control compared with heavy smokers.

Newswise — City of Hope patient Susan Young has had a remarkable response to a potentially revolutionary new treatment, a combination of the p53 cancer vaccine and a drug that blocks a specific cancer-aiding protein.

The 69-year-old came to City of Hope in August 2016 from UC Davis with advanced triple-negative breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones and skin. She had exhausted all of her chemotherapy options, and this experimental treatment was her last hope. The only other option was hospice.

“At least 60 to 70 percent of her body was covered by lesions, inflammation and thickened, purplish skin,” said Yuan Yuan, M.D., breast cancer oncologist at City of Hope, who treated Young. “Six weeks into her treatment, the skin lesions were gone, her itchiness went away. It’s quite a dramatic response.”

So dramatic, in fact, that Yuan refers to Young as her “miracle patient.”

“This in some ways is pretty unprecedented. This patient is at a late stage of her disease. There are no treatments available that would have done the same thing,” said Don J. Diamond, Ph.D., chair of the Department of Experimental Therapeutics at City of Hope.

Young received a combination of the p53 vaccine and the drug pembrolizumab. Diamond developed the vaccine and has been studying its effectiveness in clinical trials at COH since 2010. He currently is testing it on ovarian cancer and other solid tumors, such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal masses.

“I've responded great. I'm feeling good,” said Young, who has received six of seven pembrolizumab infusions, each of which takes about a half-hour, and all three p53 vaccine injections. “My skin has cleared up. I think the prognosis is going to be good now.”

Teaching the immune system to fight

The most frequent mutation across all cancers occurs in a gene called p53, which contributes to cells becoming oncogenic when they produce a mutant form of the p53 protein (p53 gene mutations are present in about 50% of malignancies). Diamond’s vaccine boosts the immune response to many different mutant forms of p53. The researchers tested this vaccine, known as p53MVA, in a 2013 clinical trial and found it to be safe in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers.

However, patients whose T cells had pre-existing high levels of a protein named PD1 — a molecule that instructs immune cells to shut down — responded poorly to the anti-p53 vaccine. In a subsequent laboratory study, the COH researchers showed that these patients’ immune cells could be reactivated by treatment with a PD1 inhibitor that is a biosimilar to the clinical drug called pembrolizumab. Together, the vaccine and the drug potentially could form a potent team to reactivate the immune system to quickly clear out cancer cells.

Before Young, the combination had been tried on patients with recurrent solid tumors such as non-small cell lung cancer, melanoma, renal cell carcinoma and many other cancer types.

So far, while Diamond has noted an immune response in patients given the combination treatment in clinical trials, he has not seen a clinical benefit.

That is, until he met Young.

“We have treated a number of different types of patients with the combination, but nothing is even in the same universe as this,” he said.

A 'shocking' response

Young, who tested positive for the p53 mutation, has been fighting breast cancer for eight years and has undergone “one chemo after another,” Yuan said.

Referred to City of Hope by her physician at Davis, she began responding to the experimental treatment right away, Yuan said, her skin tumors disappearing and the latest biopsies showing no cancer. “The purple, thickened skin has faded away, the skin color has normalized. She’s healed, basically,” she said.

“It’s such a promising early response. It’s quite unusual,” she added. “We have two drugs here so it’s hard to dissect which drug did what, but we do think the vaccine played a key role.”

“It was shocking to me,” said Diamond. “What we have noticed is that her immune response to p53 has been increasing as time goes on. It was of tremendous magnitude in the last [blood] draw.”

The next step will be to take bone and CT scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally, which Young will receive in a couple of weeks.

Even now, though, Young is “extremely happy with the results,” Yuan said. “Her psychological wellbeing has improved. Her appetite is better, she’s more functional. She went through a lot. It will be very interesting to follow up.”

“I couldn't look at myself. It was really hard,” Young said of the skin lesions she had endured for five years. They started to go away after the third treatment, she said. “Even the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gone.”Further study needed

What Diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triple-negative breast cancer patients who test positive for p53. A couple of major drug companies have already expressed interest in his vaccine, he said.

“What we would like is to have women come here from all over the country and the world to receive this vaccine formula so that we can test this combination,” Diamond said. “If it happened once, maybe it will happen twice. But we’ve got to get these patients in.”

Following the success in Young, the formula has recently been given to two other triple negative breast cancer patients at City of Hope. It’s too early to gauge the response, although “the entire breast team is very excited about this,” Diamond said. “We saw this phenomenal response in this patient. I am very encouraged by the findings, so I think there’s a story to come.”

“Everything is turning around for me,” Young said. “I was very frightened when I started out. I'm not that frightened anymore. I know it still can turn for me, but I think I'm going to be the miracle that [Dr. Yuan] wants.”",0
"Highlight• A healthy diet high in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and low in red meat, salt, and refined sugars was linked with a reduced risk of early death in an analysis of 7 studies.

Chronic kidney disease affects 10% to 13% of adults.

Newswise — Washington, DC (December 8, 2016) — A diet that emphasizes healthy foods rather than individual nutrients may help patients with chronic kidney disease live longer. The findings appear in an upcoming issue of the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology (CJASN).

Patients with chronic kidney disease are advised to follow dietary recommendations that restrict individual nutrients such as phosphorus, potassium, protein, and sodium; however, empirical evidence suggests that these restrictions—which can be difficult to abide by—have limited effects on reducing patients’ risk of premature death.

Emerging evidence indicates that overall eating patterns may have greater effects on patients’ health and longevity. To investigate, a tem led by Giovanni Strippoli, MD, PhD (University of Bari, in Italy and Diaverum, in Sweden), and Jaimon Kelly (Bond University, in Australia) analyzed the medical literature, finding 7 relevant studies that included a total of 15,285 participants.

Healthy dietary patterns were generally higher in fruits, vegetables, fish, legumes, cereals, whole grains, and fiber, and they were lower in red meat, salt, and refined sugars. In 6 studies, healthy dietary patterns were consistently associated with a 20% to 30% lower rate of mortality, with 46 fewer deaths per 1000 people over 5 years. There was no significant association between healthy dietary patterns and risk of kidney failure.

“Chronic kidney disease now affects about 10% to 13% of the adult population and substantially increases risks of cardiovascular complications and early death,” said Prof. Strippoli. “In the absence of randomized trials and large individual cohort studies, this study is the best available evidence to drive clinical decision-making by patients and doctors on whole dietary approaches in chronic kidney disease.”

Study co-authors include Suetonia Palmer, PhD, Shu Ning Wai, MSc, Marinella Ruospo, MSc, Juan-Jesus Carrero, PhD,and Katrina Campbell, PhD.

"JACKSONVILLE, Fla. — Researchers at Mayo Clinic’s campus in Florida have conducted the world’s first prospective, blinded and placebo-controlled clinical study to test the benefit of using bone marrow stem cells, a regenerative medicine therapy, to reduce arthritic pain and disability in knees.

The researchers say such testing is needed because there are at least 600 stem cell clinics in the U.S. offering one form of stem cell therapy or another to an estimated 100,000-plus patients, who pay thousands of dollars, out of pocket, for the treatment, which has not undergone demanding clinical study.

The findings in The American Journal of Sports Medicine include an anomalous finding — patients not only had a dramatic improvement in the knee that received stem cells, but also in their other knee, which also had painful arthritis but received only a saline control injection. Each of the 25 patients enrolled in the study had two bad knees, but did not know which knee received the stem cells.

Given that the stem cell-treated knee was no better than the control-treated knee — both were significantly better than before the study began — the researchers say the stem cells’ effectiveness remains somewhat uninterpretable. They are only able to conclude the procedure is safe to undergo as an option for knee pain, but they cannot yet recommend it for routine arthritis care.

“Our findings can be interpreted in ways that we now need to test — one of which is that bone marrow stem cell injection in one ailing knee can relieve pain in both affected knees in a systemic or whole-body fashion,” says the study’s lead author, Shane Shapiro, M.D., a Mayo Clinic orthopedic physician.

“One hypothesis is that the stem cells we tested can home to areas of injury where they are needed, which makes sense, given that stem cells injected intravenously in cancer treatments end up in the patients’ bone marrow where they need to go,” he says. “This is just a theory that can explain our results, so it needs further testing.”

Another explanation is that merely injecting any substance into a knee offered relief from pain.

“That could be, but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising, given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended,” says Dr. Shapiro.

He adds that these findings are important because while use of a patient’s own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular, the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated.

Stem cell clinics often offer expensive treatments for conditions that range from multiple sclerosis, lung and heart disease, to cosmetic treatments, such as facelifts. None of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patient’s own cells is not a drug.

But, depending on how they are processed and used, stem cells can, in fact, be regulated by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as biological products or drugs requiring rigorous safety and efficacy approval processes. In early September, the FDA held scientific meetings to clarify how to regulate such practices.

Mayo Clinic researchers developed their study with FDA approval.

“We feel that if we are going to offer any stem cell procedures to our patients, the science needs to be worked out,” Dr. Shapiro says.

The study was conducted in Mayo’s Human Cell Therapy Lab. Researchers extracted 60 to 90 milliliters of bone marrow from each patient, then filtered it, removed all blood cells, and concentrated it down to 4 to 5 milliliters. The solution, which contained tens of thousands of stem cells, was injected into a patient’s knee using ultrasound-guided imagery.

“We actually counted all of the stem cells with markers that are accepted by the FDA, and we made sure they would be able to survive inside the patient,” Dr. Shapiro says. “Counting is expensive. Most clinics just draw the cells from bone marrow or fat and inject them back into the patient without checking for stem cells, hoping that patients get better,” he says.

Dr. Shapiro and his colleagues are currently designing new studies that will test whether the stem cells home to distant areas of injuries, as well as exploring other implications suggested in their findings.

Study investigators include Mayo Clinic in Florida senior author Mary L. O’Connor, M.D., Shari E. Kazmerchak, Michael G. Heckman, and Abba C. Zubair, M.D., Ph.D. Dr. O’Connor is now at Yale University.

Funding for this study was from Mayo Clinic’s Center for Regenerative Medicine.

Newswise — When combined with psychological counseling, a single dose of a mind-altering compound contained in psychedelic mushrooms significantly lessens mental anguish in distressed cancer patients for months at a time, according to results of a clinical trial led by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center.

Published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology online Dec.1, the study showed that one-time treatment with the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin — whose use required federal waivers because it is a banned substance — quickly brought relief from distress that then lasted for more than six months in 80 percent of the 29 study subjects monitored, based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression.

The NYU Langone-led study was published side by side with a similar study from Johns Hopkins. Study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry, addiction, and palliative care.

“Our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,” says study lead investigator Stephen Ross, MD, director of substance abuse services in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone.

“If larger clinical trials prove successful, then we could ultimately have available a safe, effective, and inexpensive medication — dispensed under strict control — to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients,” says Ross, also an associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine.

Study co-investigator Jeffrey Guss, MD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile. Study participants, he says, experienced no serious negative effects, such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions.

Although the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood, it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin, which is known to control mood and anxiety. Serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression.

For the study, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a 0.3 milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo (250 milligrams of niacin) known to produce a “rush” that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience.

Approximately half way through the study’s monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo, and those who first took niacin, then received psilocybin. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. Guss says, “The randomization, placebo control, and double-blind procedures maximized the validity of the study results.”

One of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the study’s extended monitoring period — specifically, eight months for those who took psilocybin first.

All patients in the study — mostly women age 22 to 75 who are or were patients at the Perlmutter Cancer Center of NYU Langone — had either advanced breast, gastrointestinal, or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state.

Co-investigator Anthony Bossis, PhD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, says patients also reported post-psilocybin improvements in their quality of life: going out more, greater energy, getting along better with family members, and doing well at work. Several also reported variations of spirituality, unusual peacefulness, and increased feelings of altruism.

“Our study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress,” says Bossis. “And if it’s true for cancer care, then it could apply to other stressful medical conditions.”

Bossis cautions that patients should not consume psilocybin on their own or without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor. He also says “Psilocybin therapy may not work for everyone, and some groups, such as people with schizophrenia, as well as adolescents, should not be treated with it.”

Both the NYU Langone and Johns Hopkins studies were principally funded by the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit, scientific institution with the principal mission of helping to design, review and fund studies on the use of psilocybin for a wide range of ailments (Ross previously served as a board member). Additional funding for the NYU Langone study was provided by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health (UL1 TR000038). The drug used in the study was manufactured by Organix Inc. in Woburn, Mass.

In a study published online by JAMA Surgery, Daniel E. Hall, M.D., M.Div., M.H.Sc., of the Veterans Affairs Pittsburgh Healthcare System and University of Pittsburgh, and colleagues examined the effect of a Frailty Screening Initiative (FSI) on death and complications by comparing the surgical outcomes of patients treated before and after implementation of the FSI.

As the U.S. population ages, the number of operations performed on elderly patients will likely increase. Frailty predicts postoperative mortality and illness more than age alone, thus presenting opportunities to identify the highest-risk surgical patients and provide tailored clinical care to improve their outcomes. This study included 9,153 patients (average age, 60 years) from a Veterans Affairs medical center who presented for major, elective, noncardiac surgery. Preoperative frailty was assessed with the Risk Analysis Index (RAI; a 14-item questionnaire), and the records of all frail patients (as determined by a certain RAI score) were flagged for administrative review by the chief of surgery (or designee) before the scheduled operation. On the basis of this review, clinicians from surgery, anesthesia, critical care, and palliative care were notified of the patient’s frailty and associated surgical risks; if indicated, perioperative plans were modified based on team input.

The researchers found that overall 30-day mortality decreased from 1.6 percent (84 of 5,275 patients) to 0.7 percent (26 of 3,878 patients) after FSI implementation. Improvement was greatest among frail patients (12.2 percent to 3.8 percent), although mortality rates also decreased among the robust patients (1.2 percent to 0.3 percent). The magnitude of improvement among frail patients increased at 180 and 365 days.

“The ultimate cause of the survival benefit is likely multifactorial, including changes in preoperative decision making, intraoperative management, and postoperative rescue,” the authors write.

“This study reveals the feasibility of facility-wide frailty screening in elective surgical populations. It also suggests the potential to improve postoperative survival among the frail through systematic administrative screening, review, and optimization of perioperative plans. The absolute reduction in 180-day mortality among frail patients was more than 19 percent, with improvement remaining robust even after controlling for age, frailty, and predicted mortality.”

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Intrarosa (prasterone) to treat women experiencing moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse (dyspareunia), a symptom of vulvar and vaginal atrophy (VVA), due to menopause. Intrarosa is the first FDA approved product containing the active ingredient prasterone, which is also known as dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA).

During menopause, levels of estrogen decline in vaginal tissues, which may cause a condition known as VVA, leading to symptoms such as pain during sexual intercourse.

""Pain during sexual intercourse is one of the most frequent symptoms of VVA reported by postmenopausal women,"" said Audrey Gassman, M.D., deputy director of the Division of Bone, Reproductive, and Urologic Products (DBRUP) in the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER). ""Intrarosa provides an additional treatment option for women seeking relief of dyspareunia caused by VVA.""

Efficacy of Intrarosa, a once-daily vaginal insert, was established in two 12-week placebo-controlled clinical trials of 406 healthy postmenopausal women, 40 to 80 years of age, who identified moderate to severe pain during sexual intercourse as their most bothersome symptom of VVA. Women were randomly assigned to receive Intrarosa or a placebo vaginal insert. Intrarosa, when compared to placebo, was shown to reduce the severity of pain experienced during sexual intercourse.

The safety of Intrarosa was established in four 12-week placebo-controlled trials and one 52-week open-label trial. The most common adverse reactions were vaginal discharge and abnormal Pap smear.

Although DHEA is included in some dietary supplements, the efficacy and safety of those products have not been established for diagnosing, curing, mitigating, treating or preventing any disease.

Intrarosa is marketed by Quebec-based Endoceutics Inc.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

"Newswise — NEW ORLEANS – NOV. 4, 2016 – Patients with obesity who swallowed gas-filled balloon capsules designed to help them eat less, lost 1.9 times more weight than patients who relied on diet, exercise and lifestyle therapy alone, according to new research* presented today at ObesityWeek 2016, the largest international event focused on the basic science, clinical application and prevention and treatment of obesity. The annual conference is hosted by the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The Obesity Society (TOS).

“The significant weight loss achieved with the Obalon 6-Month Balloon System is maintained at 12 months,” said Aurora Pryor, MD, study co-author and Chief Bariatric, Foregut and Advanced GI Surgery, Stony Brook University. “This combination of lifestyle modification and balloon therapy provides a new low risk option for patients struggling with obesity.”

The Obalon 6-Month Balloon System, a swallowable, gas-filled intragastric balloon for weight loss in adults with obesity for whom diet and exercise has failed, was approved in September by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It involves a balloon contained within a capsule that, once it reaches the stomach, is inflated with gas via a microcatheter. Up to three balloons may be placed over the first three months, but the entire treatment period lasts six months. The inflated balloons make patients feel full. Treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program. The device is manufactured by Obalon Therapeutics, Inc., based in San Diego, CA.

Results of the study were based on a double-blinded randomized, sham-controlled trial of 387 patients, about half of whom received treatment with the Obalon balloon and the other half with a sugar-filled sham capsule designed to look like the device. Patients, who had a body mass index (BMI) of between 30 and 40, swallowed three capsules over a 12-week period (one every three weeks). All patients at the 15 study sites also underwent 25 minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks. After six months, patients were informed which capsule they received and those with the Obalon balloons had them removed endoscopically.

Average percent total weight loss after six months for Obalon balloon patients was 6.81 percent, while those in the sham control group had 3.59 percent total average weight loss. Balloon-treated patients had nearly 25 percent excess weight loss. Six months after the balloons were removed, 89.5 percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained. Researchers say a single adverse event, a bleeding gastric ulcer, occurred in one balloon patient on high dose NSAIDs who had an outpatient knee replacement procedure. Non-serious adverse device events, mostly abdominal cramping and nausea, occurred in 90.8 percent of patients (99.6% were rated mild or moderate).

“There is no magic pill for obesity, but this swallowable balloon and other intragastric balloons may offer new hope to people who otherwise would not seek treatment or not have as good a result with diet and exercise alone,” said Raul J. Rosenthal, MD, ASMBS President and Chairman, Department of General Surgery, Cleveland Clinic Florida, who was not involved in the study. “The balloon and other technologies may help to fill the therapeutic gaps between diet and exercise and medical therapy, and medical therapy and surgery, where the gaps are quite large.”

People with obesity and severe obesity have higher rates of heart disease, diabetes, some cancers, arthritis, sleep apnea, high blood pressure and dozens of other diseases and conditions. Studies have shown individuals with a BMI greater than 30 have a 50 to 100 percent greater risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals.[1][2]

Metabolic/bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lasting treatment for severe obesity and many related conditions and results in significant weight loss. The Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques.[3] The risk of death is about 0.1 percent[4] and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4 percent.[5]

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), in 2011–2014, the prevalence of obesity was just over 36 percent in adults, with a higher prevalence among women than men (38.3% vs. 34.3%) and older than younger adults (37% vs. 32.3%). Obese is medically defined as having a body mass index (BMI), a measure of height to weight, that's more than 30. The ASMBS estimates about 24 million Americans have severe obesity, which would mean a BMI of 35 or more with an obesity-related condition like diabetes or a BMI of 40.

About the ASMBSThe ASMBS is the largest organization for bariatric surgeons in the nation. It is a non-profit organization that works to advance the art and science of bariatric surgery and is committed to educating medical professionals and the lay public about bariatric surgery as an option for the treatment of morbid obesity, as well as the associated risks and benefits. It encourages its members to investigate and discover new advances in bariatric surgery, while maintaining a steady exchange of experiences and ideas that may lead to improved surgical outcomes for morbidly obese patients.

"The article reports that the device provides clear visualization of the surgical site where the tumor was removed, thereby improving communication between the surgeon and radiation oncologist. The study also noted that the device provides a helpful guide for post-treatment mammograms and other long-term follow-up to check for any cancer recurrence in these patients.

A second study, presented at the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) 2016 annual conference, describes the extra utility that BioZorb can provide, by significantly reducing the amount of normal breast and surrounding tissues that are exposed to radiation treatment.

The World Journal of Surgery article, by lead author breast surgeon Michael J. Cross, concluded that the 3-D marker is an ""effective method for delineating the tumor bed with a significant utility for RT (radiation therapy) planning.""

In the course of this three-year study, Dr. Cross and colleagues also documented a favorable shift toward use of hypo-fractionated radiation treatment, a shorter form of radiation associated with a substantial reduction in treatment costs.

""Through our experience with this marker, we've observed that its use results in less radiation dose to the patient compared to whole breast radiation, plus a better overall cosmetic outcome,"" said Dr. Cross, a nationally known breast surgeon at Breast Treatment Associates, in Fayetteville Ark. ""We were also pleased to note in our research that there were no device-related complications in this group of patients, and that none of them had a recurrence of cancer.""

The BioZorb device is placed during lumpectomy surgery, which removes the cancer and preserves the breast. It is the first and only device that identifies in a reliable way the 3-D region where the tumor was removed. It is particularly effective because by suturing the implant to the tumor bed, the surgeon can more precisely indicate to the radiation oncologist where the cancer was located. Dr. Cross notes that because of the marker's unique configuration, it can also assist with reconstructing the surgical region during the healing process.

The implantable marker consists of a framework made of a bioabsorbable material that holds six titanium clips. The framework slowly dissolves in the body over the course of a year or more. The tiny marker clips stay in place so the surgical site can be viewed for long-term monitoring such as mammograms.

As part of the research for the World Journal of Surgery study, 108 patients with early-stage breast cancer were prospectively implanted with the marker during ""reconstructive lumpectomy,"" a method of oncoplastic surgery to remove the cancer while reconstructing the remaining breast to improve cosmetic outcomes. The average age of women in the study was 63 years.

The authors concluded that the marker was helpful for several different types of physicians involved in the care of women with breast cancer: surgeons, radiation oncologists who plan and oversee radiation treatment, and radiologists who follow women after breast cancer treatment.

The article also noted that there was a shift during the three-year course of the study toward increasing use of hypo-fractionated radiation methods. These methods decrease the time it takes for patients to complete radiation treatment -- and are estimated to cut the cost of treatment by approximately 25%. The authors said use of the marker facilitated their shift toward these shorter courses of radiotherapy.

Use of the marker allowed physicians to be more confident in their targeting and rely less on ""ambiguous planning targets such as the seroma and surrounding tissue changes."" Seroma is a collection of fluid that builds up in the area of tissue injury after surgery.

While seromas have customarily been targeted for radiation treatment, they do not always reflect where the cancer was and can overestimate the size of the target areas in need of radiation. By more precisely marking the tumor bed, the article said, BioZorb can reduce the amount of healthy tissue that would otherwise receive unnecessary radiation.

The second recent study, presented at the 2016 annual ASTRO conference in Boston, described a collaborative approach between a radiation oncologist and breast surgeon. They studied the question of whether the marker could better identify the true lumpectomy cavity and thereby reduce the amount of tissue that is irradiated.

The authors – radiation oncologist William Hall, M.D., and breast surgeon Cary Kaufman, M.D. -- combined their analysis of 10 cases in which BioZorb was used.

They concluded that the tissue marker could significantly reduce radiation of healthy breast tissue (an average of 65% reduction), as well as avoid irradiating inadvertent seromas that are more common with oncoplastic procedures. By providing better targeting, they said, the marker could also play a role in facilitating the use of external beam partial breast irradiation.

""The process of delivering radiation treatment is substantially streamlined by having the 3D marker in place,"" said Dr. Hall. ""The marker tells us where the tumor was and helps us determine appropriate forms of treatment, whether with partial breast irradiation or standard whole breast irradiation and a boost dose at the end of the treatment process.""

Dr. Hall is a radiation oncologist in the Department of Radiation Oncology at PeaceHealth St. Joseph Medical Center (Bellingham, Wash). Dr. Kaufman is Medical Director of the Bellingham Regional Breast Center and past chairman of the National Accreditation Program for Breast Centers.

"Newswise — CHICAGO – Epidural anesthesia may do more than relieve pain during labor; in some women it may decrease the likelihood of postpartum depression, suggests a preliminary study presented at the ANESTHESIOLOGY® 2016 annual meeting.

“Labor pain matters more than just for the birth experience. It may be psychologically harmful for some women and play a significant role in the development of postpartum depression,” said Grace Lim, M.D., director of obstetric anesthesiology at Magee Women’s Hospital of the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and lead investigator on the study. “We found that certain women who experience good pain relief from epidural analgesia are less likely to exhibit depressive symptoms in the postpartum period.”

The researchers controlled for factors already known to increase the risk for postpartum depression, including pre-existing depression and anxiety, as well as post-delivery pain caused by tissue trauma during childbirth. After accounting for these factors, the study found that in some women, labor pain was still a significant risk factor for postpartum depression symptoms. And, therefore, alleviating this pain might help reduce the risk for postpartum depression. In the study, researchers reviewed the medical records of 201 women who used epidural analgesia and had their pain assessed using a 0-10 scale during labor. They calculated the percent improvement in pain (PIP) throughout labor after the implementation of epidural analgesia. Depression risk was assessed using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) six weeks after childbirth. Researchers found the higher the PIP scores, the lower the EPDS scores.

“Although we found an association between women who experience less pain during labor and lower risk for postpartum depression, we do not know if effective pain control with epidural analgesia will assure avoidance of the condition,” said Dr. Lim. “Postpartum depression can develop from a number of things including hormonal changes, psychological adjustment to motherhood, social support, and a history of psychiatric disorders.”

Labor pain may be more problematic for some women than others, the authors note. Additional research is needed to identify which women are more likely to experience severe labor pain and who would benefit the most from effective labor pain-control strategies to help reduce the risk and affect of pain on postpartum recovery.

"Even partial steroid treatment can benefit extremely preterm infants, NIH study suggests

Infants exposed to partial treatment in the womb healthier than those not exposed.

What

Steroids improve survival and reduce the chances of certain birth defects for extremely premature infants, even if the treatment course is not finished before delivery, according to a study funded by the National Institutes of Health (NIH). Steroids are a standard treatment for pregnant women likely to deliver before 34 weeks because these drugs are known to reduce the chance of complications and death among premature infants. However, because completing the entire course takes at least 48 hours, health care providers may opt not to begin treatment when premature delivery is imminent.

The new study, supported by NIH’s Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), provides strong evidence that even a partial course can have some benefit. Researchers evaluated 6,121 extremely premature infants who had been born between 22 and 27 weeks of pregnancy at sites in NICHD’s Neonatal Research Network. The study followed the infants from birth to 18 to 22 months of age and measured survival and brain and nervous system outcomes. The infants were grouped according to the mother’s steroid treatment — no treatment, partial treatment or complete treatment.

Among the three groups, researchers found significant differences in rates of death, complications such as bleeding in the brain (severe intracranial hemorrhage), intestinal problems (necrotizing enterocolitis), lung disease (bronchopulmonary dysplasia) and brain and nervous system impairment. Infants in the complete treatment group fared best. Infants in the partial treatment group fared better than untreated infants. The study team also found evidence that the better outcomes likely were due to lower rates of bleeding in the brain and of a brain injury called cystic periventricular leukomalacia. Overall, these findings suggest that starting steroid treatment promptly — even if the likelihood of completion is low — is beneficial when extremely premature birth is imminent.

Additional funding for the study was provided by NIH’s National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences.

NIH…Turning Discovery Into Health®",1
"Newswise — Columbus, OH. Good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won’t heal. A team of researchers at The Ohio State University has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous, small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection.

Nearly 7 million Americans have chronic wounds – typically a result of diabetes, obesity or other conditions that impact circulation – costing the healthcare system nearly $25 billion each year. The non-healing wounds are painful, can permanently damage nerves, prevent mobility and in extreme cases, cause infection that can lead to death.

The patch’s design significantly advances existing FDA-approved wireless electroceutical dressing (WED) that harnesses the body’s innate response to injury to help wounds heal.

“A wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration; however, this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds,” said Sashwati Roy, PhD, an Associate Professor in the Department of Surgery at Ohio State’s College of Medicine. “The prototype dressing mimics this physiological process, and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal, we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control.”

Roy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria, which at times are free floating within a wound – can sometimes mobilize, creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm. The immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm, and antibiotics can’t get in either – causing constant inflammation and low-level infection that can further dampen the healing process.

Now, with support from Ohio State’s Center for Clinical and Translational Science (CCTS), researchers from both the College of Engineering and the College of Medicine are taking the technology to the next level. Working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by Shaurya Prakash, PhD and Vish Subramaniam, PhD, the scientists have optimized the bandage’s design and the amount of electrical current delivered. Like present WEDs, the new prototype is flexible, portable and self-contained. Made of silk and silver, the experimental dressing includes a self-contained battery that delivers a continuous, safe, low-level electrical current to the injury. “We’re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds, and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding,” said Subramaniam, chair of the Department of Mechanical and Aerospace Engineering at Ohio State. “The destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria, reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body’s natural immune response to work more effectively. Bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics, but to our knowledge, bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals.” To test the experimental design, Roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome – obesity, high blood pressure, high blood sugar - which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds. Animal models had skin injuries infected with Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Staphylococcus aureus or Acinetobacter baumannii, three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant.

Early results, which were presented at the Wound Healing Society’s Annual Meeting in April 2016 indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today. Scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways: by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms, potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body’s natural immune response. The team’s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population; however, the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries. Roy also notes that the U. S. Department of Defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front.

“This technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit. It could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care.”

The team already has interest from several industry partners, and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level.

Roy’s research team includes Shomita S. Steiner, PhD; Shaurya Prakash, PhD; Gayle Gordillo, MD; Vish Subramaniam, PhD and Chandan K. Sen, PhD.# # #

"Newswise — WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. – Sept. 28, 2016 – Hot flashes – the bane of existence for many women during menopause – can be reduced in frequency by almost half for about 50 percent of women over eight weeks of acupuncture treatment, according to scientists at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center.

In a study published in the Sept. 28 issue of the journal Menopause, scientists reported that about half the women in the study reduced the frequency of hot flashes, while half did not.

“Women bothered by hot flashes and night sweats may want to give acupuncture a try as a relatively low-cost, low-risk treatment,” said Nancy Avis, Ph.D., lead author of the study and professor of Public Health Sciences at Wake Forest School of Medicine, a part of Wake Forest Baptist. “Women will know pretty quickly if acupuncture will work for them. Women who had a reduction in their hot flashes saw a benefit beginning after about three to four weeks of weekly treatments.”

The National Institutes of Health-funded study was designed to examine different patterns of responses to acupuncture. Participants included 209 perimenopausal and postmenopausal women ages 45 to 60 who had on average at least four hot flashes or night sweats per day. Women were randomized to receive up to 20 acupuncture treatments within six months or to a control group.

Of the 170 women who received acupuncture, a small group of women (11.9 percent) had an 85 percent reduction in hot flashes by the eighth week of the study, Avis said. Forty-seven percent of the study group reported a 47 percent reduction over this same time frame. However, 37 percent showed only a minimal reduction of 9.6 percent in frequency of hot flashes, while 4 percent reported a 100 percent increase in hot flashes. “We had hoped to identify some of the characteristics of the women who benefitted from acupuncture, but like so many treatments, we could not really tell ahead of time who would benefit,” Avis said. Funding for the study was provided by grant R01AT005854 from the National Center for Complementary and Integrative Health, at NIH.

"For Immediate Release: September 23, 2016

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved three new indications for Ilaris (canakinumab). The new indications are for rare and serious auto-inflammatory diseases in adult and pediatric patients:

Tumor Necrosis Factor Receptor Associated Periodic Syndrome (TRAPS);

Hyperimmunoglobulin D Syndrome (HIDS)/Mevalonate Kinase Deficiency (MKD); and

Familial Mediterranean Fever (FMF).

All three syndromes are hereditary diseases that are characterized by periodic attacks of fever and inflammation, as well as severe muscle pain. There are no previously approved therapies for TRAPS or HIDS/MKD.

“For the first time, patients with TRAPS and HIDS/MKD, two painful and life altering diseases, have access to a treatment that may help improve their quality of life,” said Badrul Chowdhury, M.D., Ph.D, director of the Division of Pulmonary, Allergy and Rheumatology Products in FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research.

Ilaris was previously approved for another periodic fever syndrome called Cryopyrin-Associated Periodic Syndromes (CAPS) and for active systemic juvenile idiopathic arthritis. Health care professionals should review the prescribing information in the labeling for detailed information about the approved uses.

Approvals for the new indications were based on clinical studies, including safety, efficacy and pharmacokinetic data. The most common adverse reactions for these indications are injection site reactions and being more susceptible to catching colds.

Ilaris can cause serious side effects, including increased risk of serious infections. Ilaris can lower the immune system’s ability to fight infections. Other serious side effects include decreased ability to fight infections (immunosuppression) and allergic reactions. Patients experiencing any symptoms of an allergic reaction should call their healthcare provider, including: rash, itching and hives, difficulty breathing or swallowing, and dizziness or feeling faint. Patients should not get live vaccines if receiving Ilaris. Patients should not receive Ilaris if they are allergic to canakinumab or any of the ingredients in Ilaris.

Ilaris is manufactured and distributed by Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation, of East Hanover, New Jersey.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices.

"Newswise — CHAPEL HILL, NC – For patients whose hearing is considered “too good” for traditional cochlear implants, but whose hearing loss is too advanced to benefit from hearing aids, there hasn’t been a device to meet their needs.

But a hearing implant system that just received FDA approval will now meet that previously unmet need and benefit those patients, according to Harold C. Pillsbury, MD, chair of the Department of Otolaryngology/Head and Neck Surgery at the UNC School of Medicine.

SYNCHRONY EAS (Electric Acoustic Stimulation) Hearing Implant System, which is manufactured by Durham-based MED-EL Corporation, received FDA approval on September 16.

UNC participated in the EAS System clinical trials and implanted the device in more patients than any other hearing center that participated.

“Our clinical trial participants were overwhelmingly receptive to this new technology,” Pillsbury said. “The technology is remarkable and so were the results.”

The implant relies on two auditory technologies – the SYNCHRONY cochlear implant that stimulates the auditory nerve for high-frequency hearing loss and the EAS audio processor, which has a built-in acoustic amplification for low-frequency hearing loss.

The SYNCHRONY EAS implant best assists people whose hearing loss is referred to as “ski-slope” hearing loss, based on the steeply sloping image that appears on an audiogram when a patient has more trouble hearing higher-frequency sounds. Using traditional hearing aids, those patients often have difficulty understanding speech above the din of background noise.

Ninety-seven percent of patients participating in the MED-EL EAS clinical trial reported a benefit from EAS within the first year. Ninety-two percent of participants reported an improvement in their ability to hear even among background noise, one of the most challenging listening environments for people with hearing loss. And 90 percent reported satisfaction with the device overall.

“On average, patients performed more than twice as well on tests of speech understanding with EAS than they did with their hearing aids preoperatively, which speaks to the benefits of this technology,” Pillsbury said.

The National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders estimates that 26 million Americans between the ages of 20 and 69 have high-frequency hearing loss. While 2 percent of adults aged 45 to 54 have disabling hearing loss, the rate increases to 8.5 percent for adults aged 55 to 64. Nearly 25 percent of those ages 65 to 74 and 50 percent of those who are 75 and older have disabling hearing loss.

The EAS System FDA approval is for candidates who are 18 years old and older who have normal to moderate sensorineural hearing loss in the low frequencies, sloping to a severe-to-profound hearing loss in the high frequencies.

MED-EL expects that the SYNCHRONY EAS Hearing Implant System will be available in the coming months.",1
"NEWTOWN, Pa., Sept. 20, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- KVK Tech, Inc. announced today that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved Lomaira™ (phentermine hydrochloride USP) 8 mg tablets CIV, a low-cost, low-dose prescription medicine used for a short period of time (a few weeks) for weight reduction in adults with an initial body mass index* (BMI) of 30 or more (obese) or 27 or more (overweight) with at least one weight-related condition such as controlled high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol. Lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced-calorie diet.

Lomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals. The limited usefulness of agents of this drug class (anorectics), including Lomaira, should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use.

""At KVK Tech, we are committed to developing high-quality, FDA-approved medicines that address unmet medical needs, while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients. With Lomaira, we're giving physicians and patients access to a low-cost, low-dose version of a weight-reduction medicine, phentermine, that has been prescribed by physicians for over 50 years. Appropriate patients can take Lomaira up to three times a day, before meals – not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine,"" said Anthony Tabasso, President and Chief Executive Officer of KVK Tech. ""We developed Lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind.""

Phentermine hydrochloride, an appetite suppressant, is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss. Over 7 million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals (HCPs), including obesity medicine specialists, family practitioners, endocrinologists, internists and cardiologists. 1

Phentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from 15 to 37.5 mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast. The usual adult dose of Lomaira is one tablet three times a day 1/2 hour before meals. The butterfly-shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose, enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight-loss treatment plan to best meet each patient's needs. Dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose. Phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients 16 years of age or younger. Late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia.

Lomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle, despite the fact that two-thirds of Americans pay out-of-pocket for their weight-loss prescription medications. Through KVK Tech's Lomaira Lo-Cost Access Program , eligible patients will pay no more than 50¢ per tablet for the duration of treatment.

""Obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions. Many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight-management plan. Now, the flexibility in dosing with Lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing. They can prescribe a lower dose, a good option for some patients. They can also prescribe up to three times a day, which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon,"" said Donna Ryan, MD. ""Regrettably, many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight-loss medications and the low cost for Lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option.""

In relatively short-term clinical trials, adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with ""anorectic"" drugs (appetite suppressants) lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet. It has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions, or metabolic effects, may also be involved. 2

""Even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health,"" continued Dr. Ryan. ""It is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit."" Losing five to 10 percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits, such as improvements in blood pressure, blood cholesterol, and blood sugars.3

Some side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. See Full Prescribing Information.

Lomaira is anticipated to be available by the end of September 2016. As with all KVK Tech products, Lomaira will be exclusively manufactured and packaged in the United States, in the strictest accordance with FDA, DEA, and DEP guidelines.

IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

Don't take LomairaTM if you have a history of cardiovascular disease (e.g., coronary artery disease, stroke, arrhythmias, congestive heart failure or uncontrolled high blood pressure); are taking or have taken a monoamine oxidase inhibitor drug (MAOI) within the past 14 days; have overactive thyroid, glaucoma (increased pressure in the eyes), agitation or a history of drug abuse; are pregnant, nursing, or allergic to the sympathomimetic amines such as phentermine or any of the ingredients in Lomaira.

Taking phentermine with other drugs for weight loss is not recommended. Primary pulmonary hypertension (PPH), a rare fatal lung disease, has been reported in patients who had taken a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible association between phentermine use alone and PPH cannot be ruled out. Patients should report immediately if they experience any decrease in the amount of exercise that they can normally tolerate, shortness of breath, chest or heart pain, fainting or swelling in the lower legs.

Serious heart valve problems or disease have been reported in patients taking a combination of phentermine and fenfluramine or dexfenfluramine for weight loss. The possible role of phentermine has not been established, therefore the possibility of an association between heart valve disease and the use of phentermine alone cannot be ruled out.

If your body becomes adjusted to the maximum dose of phentermine so that its effects are experienced less strongly, the maximum dose should not be exceeded in an attempt to increase the effect.

Caution is advised while engaging in potentially hazardous activity such as driving or operating machinery while taking phentermine. Phentermine has the potential to be abused. Keep Lomaira in a safe place to prevent theft, accidental overdose, misuse or abuse. Using alcohol with phentermine may result in an adverse drug reaction.

Phentermine can cause an increase in blood pressure. Tell your doctor if you have high blood pressure, even if it's mild. If you are taking medicines for type 2 diabetes, your doctor may have to adjust these medicines while taking phentermine.

Some side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension, valvular heart disease, palpitations, increased heart rate or blood pressure, insomnia, restlessness, dry mouth, diarrhea, constipation and changes in sexual drive. These are not all of the potential side effects of phentermine. For more information, ask your doctor or pharmacist.

"“We are looking forward to demonstrating the clinical benefits of our Patient-Centric approach for treatment planning, immobilization, adaptive therapy and motion management,” said P-Cure CEO Michael Marash.

P-Cure (P-Cure, Ltd.), a leading provider of Patient-Centric solutions for proton therapy, has received U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for its patented upright imaging solution. The P-Cure system is based on a diagnostic-quality computed tomography (CT) enabling treatment planning, positioning and treatment delivery for cancer patients in a seated position.

The P-Cure Patient-Centric solution is a paradigm shifting change from the current method of treatment with the patient in the horizontal position.

“The benefits of treating patients in a seated position include greater patient comfort, less internal organ movement, better saliva drainage and a better position for breathing for asthmatic and other patients experiencing impaired breathing. It may also deliver less collateral radiation to sensitive organs while enabling greater accuracy in proton beam delivery,” said Michael Marash, Ph.D., founder and CEO of P-Cure.

Adult and pediatric patients who will initially benefit from this clinical breakthrough will be those treated for cancers of the lung, breast, chest, the head and neck, and lower torso.

In addition to the clinical benefits of P-Cure’s solution, there are also significant economic advantages to treating patients in a seated position. With P-Cure, oncologists can develop a compact, gantry-less proton center for significantly less capital and operating costs, essentially making proton therapy more widely available and attainable.

Because of the high capital costs, proton therapy is currently only available to less than one percent of patients who could potentially benefit from it. The P-Cure gantry-less system significantly reduces many factors associated with proton therapy including the capital cost of equipment and construction, the size of a single room center or multi-room expandable center and the time from center planning to treatment.

“We are excited to receive FDA clearance for our upright imaging technology. We are looking forward to demonstrating the clinical benefits of our Patient-Centric approach for treatment planning, immobilization, adaptive therapy and motion management. The P-Cure team is committed to enabling all oncology centers and hospitals globally to establish cost-effective proton therapy services for the best possible care and cure,” said Dr. Marash.

About P-Cure:

P-Cure is the innovative provider of image-guided solutions for better clinical effectiveness of proton therapy at a fraction of the current capital and operating costs. P-Cure continues to develop advanced patient-centric solutions with a focus on adaptive therapy and real time motion management. P-Cure’s first product was cleared by the FDA in 2010.

"For centuries pathologists have relied on the microscopic examination of tumors to distinguish between atypical moles and melanoma. By analyzing the level of proteins within mole cells, mass spectrometry can aid in the diagnosis of atypical moles. In this study, mass spectrometry correlated better than the gold standard of histologic examination to determine if an atypical mole was in fact benign or a melanoma. Early diagnosis of melanoma is critical to cure and long term survival.

​​​​California Skin Institute — A recently developed test for assessing suspicious moles for melanoma is more accurate than standard analyses, according to Dr. Rossitza Lazova, a former Yale investigator. The test, which analyzes proteins in cells, could provide more reliable results for clinicians with patients who might be at risk for this deadly cancer.

The study was published on August 5th in the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Melanoma is one of the most common forms of cancer and the most serious type of skin cancer. The gold standard for diagnosing melanoma is skin biopsy followed by microscopic examination of sampled tissue. However, in up to 1 in 4 cases, the results are inconclusive.

For the study, a former associate professor of Dermatology and Pathology at Yale University, Rossitza Lazova, M.D., collaborated with a national and international team of researchers to determine whether atypical moles could be more accurately diagnosed as either benign or cancerous (melanoma) using imaging mass spectrometry (IMS) — a technology that enables pathologists to focus in on individual proteins within sampled skin cells. In a prior study, the researchers used IMS to identify a molecular signature comprised of five proteins to differentiate between one type of benign mole and melanoma.

The research team retrospectively analyzed more than 100 cases of atypical moles. They compared results from IMS diagnosis to results based on standard microscopic examination of biopsies and correlated them with clinical outcomes.

The researchers found that in nearly all cases, the IMS analysis was a more accurate predictor, both of benign lesions and melanomas, than standard microscopic examination.

“Instead of pathologists being dependent solely upon the physical appearance of the cells, they now have the additional advantage of molecular information regarding the protein makeup [of cells] provided by mass spec imaging,” said Dr. Lazova, who is corresponding author on the study. “This test integrates anatomic pathology and analytical chemistry in a very useful and meaningful way.”

The finding suggests that IMS analysis, based on proteomic signatures, may improve both diagnosis and prediction of outcomes for patients with ambiguous moles, the researchers said.

"Newswise — CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va., Aug. 25, 2016 – A study published today in the prestigious New England Journal of Medicine offers the most in-depth assessment yet of the safety and effectiveness of a high-tech alternative to brain surgery to treat the uncontrollable shaking caused by the most common movement disorder. And the news is very good.

The paper outlines the results of an international clinical trial, led by Jeff Elias, MD, of the University of Virginia Health System, that evaluated the scalpel-free approach called focused ultrasound for the treatment of essential tremor (ET), a condition that afflicts an estimated 10 million Americans. Not only did the researchers determine that the procedure was safe and effective, they found that it offered a lasting benefit, reducing shaking for trial participants throughout the 12-month study period.

“This study represents a major advance for neurosurgery, treatment of brain disease and specifically the treatment of ET,” Elias said. “For the first time in a randomized controlled trial, we have shown that ultrasound can be precisely delivered through the intact human skull to treat a difficult neurological disease.”

Pioneering Tremor TrialThe multi-site clinical trial included 76 participants with moderate to severe essential tremor, a condition that often robs people of their ability to write, feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities. The trial participants all had tried existing medications, without success. The mean age was 71, and most had suffered with their tremor for many years.

Seventy-five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging. The remaining 25 percent underwent a sham procedure, to act as the control group. (They would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure.)

Participants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement, with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period. The researchers employed a 32-point scale to assess tremor severity, and they found that mean tremor scores improved by 47 percent at three months and 40 percent at 12 months. Participants reported major improvements in their quality of life. People who couldn’t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so.

Participants who received the sham procedure, on the other hand, showed no significant improvements.

“The degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study, but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life – that’s what patients really care about,” Elias said.

The most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face; in most instances, these side effects were temporary but some were permanent.

FDA Approved Based on the clinical trial led by Elias, the federal Food and Drug Administration has approved the focused ultrasound device, manufactured by InSightec Inc., for the treatment of essential tremor. The device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat, much like a magnifying glass focuses light. That heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor. Elias can actually watch as patients’ tremor decreases, and the real-time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain.

The FDA approval means UVA can make the procedure available to eligible patients. UVA, however, is still working out the necessary logistics; it’s not yet clear when Elias will begin treating patients. Because the approach is so new, insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure, though that may change in the coming months. The cost at UVA has not yet been determined.

People interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth.com/focusedultrasound. The site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as UVA prepares to make the treatment available.

The procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor. It can’t be used in patients who cannot undergo MRI imaging, including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker. It is also not available for pregnant women, people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure, patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders, patients on blood thinners, patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues. There are other exclusions as well. Doctors at UVA will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment.

Groundbreaking ResearchUVA is a world leader in focused ultrasound research. Elias and his colleagues are testing the capability of focused ultrasound to treat Parkinson’s disease, epilepsy, brain tumors and benign breast tumors.

The essential tremor research has been supported by InSightec, the Focused Ultrasound Foundation and the BIRD (US-Israel Binational Industry Research and Development) Foundation.

FOR REPORTERS: Elias will be available for interviews today, and he’ll be doing a Facebook Live broadcast at 3:15 Eastern. To arrange an interview, contact Alex Prevost at 434.906.7255 or amp3gb@virginia.edu. High-resolution images and video are available as well.

"PHILADELPHIA – Patients with aggressive subtypes of locally-advanced breast cancer may have new treatment options on the horizon, according to two reports published in July in the New England Journal of Medicine. Results of two different investigational arms of a multi-drug phase II trial conducted in part by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania and the Abramson Cancer Center, show that use of new targeted therapies neratinib or a combination of veliparib and carboplatin improves outcomes, when used in addition to standard chemotherapy before surgery for patients with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. The results are part of the multi-institutional I-SPY 2 study.

“Compared to standard therapies alone, the drugs tested in the trial substantially reduced the presence of residual disease in the breast tissue and lymph nodes (known as achieving pathological complete response, or “pCR”) when administered before surgery,” said Angela DeMichele, MD, MSCE, a professor of Hematology-Oncology and Epidemiology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, a co-investigator and Chair of Trial Operations for the study, known as I-SPY 2. “pCR strongly predicts prevention of later recurrence of incurable metastatic disease. These results suggest that neratinib and veliparib-carboplatin are very promising treatment options for patients with HER2-positive and triple-negative breast cancer, respectively. In addition, the platform used for the I-SPY 2 trial allows the research team to test these and other new therapies simultaneously, targeting tumor subtypes that would be most likely to benefit from the therapies, minimizing the exposure of patients to treatments that are not likely to work for their disease subtype and accelerating drug development”

The data presented in the two NEJM articles shows that when added to standard, neoadjuvant chemotherapy, the combination of the molecularly targeted experimental drug veliparib plus carboplatin showed sufficient improvement to meet the pre-specified threshold for “graduation” from the trial, signifying a high likelihood for success in a modest, confirmatory phase 3 neoadjuvant trial in the triple negative subset. Likewise, the experimental drug neratinib was found to have sufficient improvement in the pCR rate for patients in the HER2-positive/HR-negative subset, that it too was “graduated” from the I-SPY 2 trial.

“Because there are so many subtypes of breast cancer, and because we always test drugs in the metastatic and then adjuvant setting, finding effective therapies is a very difficult and long process. The I-SPY 2 platform allows therapies to be tested and evaluated in more expeditious, cost-effective ways,” said Laura J. Esserman, MD, MBA, a professor of Surgery and Radiology and director of the Carol Franc Buck Breast Care Center at UCSF Helen Diller Family Comprehensive Cancer Center in San Francisco, Principal Investigator on the I-SPY 2 trial and a senior author on the reports. “These results provide valuable information on which drugs should proceed to confirmatory trials to improve outcomes for patients with extremely aggressive cancers that put women at risk for early recurrence and death. For these patients, time is of the essence. In particular, finding drug combinations that are effective and less toxic is extremely important. The new studies show that by using the I-SPY 2 model to match therapies with biomarker subsets, we can create trials that are more focused, smaller, and faster, thereby exposing more patients to effective treatments.”

A major achievement in the progression of I-SPY 2 has been significantly reducing the time it takes to move forward from initiation of discussions with drug companies to enrollment of the first patients. I-SPY 2 has compressed this timeline from an average timeframe of 18 - 36 months to five months. The I-SPY 2 study start-up period takes approximately 45-60 days, with more than 50 percent of the sites opening and enrolling patients, as opposed to the traditional study start-up timing of 10 to 13 months, with less than 25 percent of the sites opening and enrolling.

More than 45 investigators, from the nation’s most prestigious and innovative cancer research centers, co-authored the two NEJM articles, with hundreds of staff and investigators involved in I-SPY 2 overall. In addition to Dr. Esserman, the Principal Investigators for I-SPY 2 is Donald A. Berry, PhD, a professor in the department of Biostatistics at The University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, and founder of Berry Consultants. A complete list of the participating centers and investigators is provided in a Supplementary Appendix available at NEJM.org.

The I-SPY 2 Trial is sponsored by QuantumLeap Healthcare Collaborative, a non-profit foundation that was established in 2005 as a collaboration between medical researchers at University of California at San Francisco, and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. QuantumLeap’s mission is to accelerate transfer of high-impact research in clinical processes and systems technology into widespread adoption so that patients and physicians can benefit from the research as soon as practicable. QuantumLeap provides operational, financial and regulatory oversight to I-SPY 2 and is also the sponsor of the I-SPY Phase 1 program and I-SPY 3, a companion phase 3 confirmatory trial that is in development.",1

Among postmenopausal women with osteoporosis at risk of fracture, daily injection of the drug abaloparatide for 18 months significantly reduced the risk of new vertebral and nonvertebral fractures compared with placebo, according to a study appearing in the August 16 issue of JAMA.

Osteoporosis is associated with substantial social, economic, and public health burdens. Based on 2010 U.S. Census data, a study estimated the prevalence of osteoporosis among women 50 to 69 years of age at 3.4 million. It has been estimated that the lifetime risk of osteoporotic fracture for a 60-year-old woman is 44 percent. Additional therapies are needed for prevention of osteoporotic fractures. As a result of its mechanism of action, it has been hypothesized that the drug abaloparatide, a synthetic peptide, would have a more pronounced anabolic (i.e., bone growing) action on bone compared with the osteoporosis drug teriparatide.

Paul D. Miller, M.D., of the Colorado Center for Bone Research, Lakewood, Colo., and colleagues randomly assigned postmenopausal women with osteoporosis to receive daily injections for 18 months of placebo (n = 821); abaloparatide (n = 824); or teriparatide (n = 818). The trial was conducted at 28 sites in 10 countries.

Among 2,463 women (average age, 69 years), 1,901 completed the study. New vertebral fractures occurred less frequently in the active treatment groups vs placebo: in 0.58 percent (n = 4) of participants in the abaloparatide group; in 0.84 percent (n = 6) of participants in the teriparatide group; and in 4.22 percent (n = 30) of those in the placebo group. The estimated event rate for nonvertebral fracture was lower with abaloparatide vs placebo: 2.7 percent in the abaloparatide group; 3.3 percent in the teriparatide group; and 4.7 percent in the placebo group.

Bone mineral density (BMD) increases were greater with abaloparatide than placebo. Incidence of hypercalcemia (the presence of abnormally high levels of calcium in the blood) was lower with abaloparatide (3.4 percent) vs teriparatide (6.4 percent). Overall, there were no differences in serious adverse events between the treatment groups.

“Further research is needed to understand the clinical importance of risk difference, the risks and benefits of abaloparatide treatment, and the efficacy of abaloparatide vs other osteoporosis treatments,” the authors write.

Editorial: Osteoporosis Therapy in Postmenopausal Women With High Risk of Fracture

“Ultimately, which therapy is selected for osteoporosis treatment may be less important than identifying and initiating an approved treatment,” write Anne R. Cappola, M.D., Sc.M., of the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, and Associate Editor, JAMA, and Dolores M. Shoback, M.D., of the University of California, San Francisco, in an accompanying editorial.

“The bar is high for any preventive treatment—in the efforts to prevent a fracture that may or may not ever occur, prescribers do not want to prescribe a therapy that causes a new problem. The way forward for fracture prevention involves not only the development of better therapies to prevent fracture and easier delivery systems but also improved adoption of existing osteoporosis therapies for patients with prior fractures and minimization of adverse effects, particularly those associated with long-term use.”

"Newswise — Eating a Mediterranean diet can slow down cognitive decline.

The Mediterranean diet can improve your mind, as well your heart, shows a study published in the open-access journal Frontiers in Nutrition.

By sticking to the Mediterranean diet the study showed that people had slowed rates of cognitive decline, reduced conversion to Alzheimer's, and improved cognitive function.

The main foods in the Mediterranean diet (MedDiet) include plant foods, such as leafy greens, fresh fruit and vegetables, cereals, beans, seeds, nuts, and legumes. The MedDiet is also low in dairy, has minimal red meat, and uses olive oil as its major source of fat.

Leading author Roy Hardman from the Centre for Human Psychopharmacology Swinburne University of Technology Melbourne Australia and his colleagues evaluated all the available papers between 2000-2015 that investigated if and how a MedDiet may impact cognitive processes over time. In total, 18 out of the 135 articles met their strict inclusion criteria.

""The most surprising result was that the positive effects were found in countries around the whole world. So regardless of being located outside of what is considered the Mediterranean region, the positive cognitive effects of a higher adherence to a MedDiet were similar in all evaluated papers;"" he said.

Attention, memory, and language improved. Memory, in particular, was positively affected by the MedDiet including improvements in: delayed recognition, long-term, and working memory, executive function, and visual constructs.

""Why is a higher adherence to the MedDiet related to slowing down the rate of cognitive decline? The MedDiet offers the opportunity to change some of the modifiable risk factors,"" he explained.

""These include reducing inflammatory responses, increasing micronutrients, improving vitamin and mineral imbalances, changing lipid profiles by using olive oils as the main source of dietary fats, maintaining weight and potentially reducing obesity, improving polyphenols in the blood, improving cellular energy metabolism and maybe changing the gut micro-biota, although this has not been examined to a larger extent yet.""

Moreover, the benefits to cognition afforded by the MedDiet were not exclusive to older individuals. Two of the included studies focused on younger adults and they both found improvements in cognition using computerized assessments.

The researchers stress that research in this area is important due to the expected extensive population aging over the next 20-30 years. They envision that the utilization of a dietary pattern, such as the MedDiet, will be an essential tool to maintain quality of life and reduce the potential social and economic burdens of manifested cognitive declines like dementia.

""I would therefore recommend people to try to adhere or switch to a MedDiet, even at an older age,"" Hardman added.

Like many researchers, Hardman takes his research home: ""I follow the diet patterns and do not eat any red meats, chicken or pork. I have fish two-three times per week and adhere to a Mediterranean style of eating.""

Treating at the Earliest Sign of MS May Offer Long-Term Benefit

MINNEAPOLIS - Starting medication for multiple sclerosis (MS) in people who show the beginning signs of the disease is associated with prolonging the time before the disease is definitively diagnosed, according to a long-term study published in the August 10, 2016, online issue of Neurology®, the medical journal of the American Academy of Neurology. The study involved people who had a first episode that was suggestive of MS, such as numbness, vision problems or problems with balance, and an MRI that showed signs of possible MS. Up to 85 percent of people in this situation, which is called clinically isolated syndrome, will in time be diagnosed with MS. “Not much research has been done on how starting treatment this early affects the long-term course of the disease,” said study author Ludwig Kappos, MD, of University Hospital Basel in Basel, Switzerland, and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. “Our study adds to the evidence supporting treatment at the earliest sign of the disease and indicates that early treatment has a long-lasting effect on disease activity.” The study started with 468 people randomly assigned to receive either early treatment with interferon beta-1b or a placebo. After participants were diagnosed with MS or after two years, the participants on the placebo could switch to interferon beta-1b or another drug. After 11 years, researchers reevaluated the 278 people who were still participating in the study, which included 167 people in the early group and 111 people in the delayed group. Those who received the early treatment were 33 percent less likely to be diagnosed with MS than those who received the delayed treatment. People in the early group also had more time before their first relapse of the disease than people in the delayed group, with 1,888 days compared to 931 days. The early group also had a lower overall yearly relapse rate of 0.21 compared to 0.26 for the delayed group, which is 19 percent lower. There was no difference between the two groups in the tests that measure overall disability or in MRI scans measuring the amount of damage caused by the disease. “Overall, early treatment appears to have a benefit on relapses, especially early in the disease, but limited effects on other outcome measures, including outcomes reported by patients,” said Brian C. Healy, PhD, of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston and a member of the American Academy of Neurology, who wrote an accompanying editorial. Limitations of the study include that participants and researchers learned after the fifth-year tests which participants received the drug and which received the placebo and that after the placebo-control phase of the study, all of the participants received treatment, so there was no untreated control group after that point. The study was supported by Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals. To learn more about multiple sclerosis, please visit http://www.aan.com/patients.

"PHILADELPHIA, Aug. 3, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Researchers today unveiled results from a new blood test to help identify which patients are at an elevated risk of Alzheimer's disease. The findings, presented at the 68th AACC Annual Scientific Meeting & Clinical Lab Expo in Philadelphia, showed that the biochip test, which allows multiple tests to be run on one blood sample, was as accurate as existing molecular tests that analyze DNA.

""This is the first time that we have used this biochip technology to test for an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease,"" said Emma C. Harte, PhD, a research scientist at Randox Laboratories. ""This type of testing is important in our quest to understand and diagnose Alzheimer's and empower patients to understand risks, consider medication, and even make early lifestyle changes.""

This test detects the presence of a protein in the blood produced by a specific variation of the apolipoprotein gene (ApoE4), which is associated with increased risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. The apolipoprotein gene is inherited from each parent and when a patient inherits the ApoE4 variant from one parent they have a three times greater risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, whereas a patient who inherits ApoE4 from both parents is eight-to-12 times more likely to develop the disease.

To verify the accuracy of the biochip test, 384 samples were analyzed and results compared to those from a standard molecular diagnostic test. Researchers from Randox Laboratories collaborated with research colleagues at the Medical University of Vienna and found that results from the two tests were in 100% agreement. As biochip tests allow clinicians and researchers to quickly run multiple tests on one sample of blood, this new test is also faster and more affordable than the standard DNA test, producing results in only three hours. This enables doctors to predict the risk of an individual developing Alzheimer's disease.

""Pairing this test with medical and family history for risk of Alzheimer's disease has the real potential to advance personalized medicine,"" said Harte. ""This fast, accurate testing will allow doctors and patients to make more informed choices earlier to potentially slow the possible progress of Alzheimer's.""

In addition to this study, researchers will present the latest in Alzheimer's disease at the AACC Annual Scientific Meeting & Clinical Lab Expo, including:

"Newswise — For three years, Andrew Harder wondered if he had prostate cancer. In 2009, he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate-specific antigen (PSA) level. When PSA is above 4 nanograms per milliliter of blood, it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor. Harder’s PSA was 9.

By the time Harder saw a urologist, it had skyrocketed to 20. His doctor recommended the traditional next step: a transrectal ultrasound (TRUS) biopsy, which involves taking random tissue samples from 12 cross sections of the prostate.

Over the course of two years, Harder, 60, an MRI technologist, would have three TRUS biopsies. They were all inconclusive.

“It is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising PSA and no proof of cancer,” Harder said.

After Harder’s third biopsy, his urologist was ready to throw in the towel, and that’s when Harder was referred to Jinxing Yu, M.D., at VCU Health. By then, Harder’s PSA was around 30.

Yu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the Department of Radiology at VCU. Over the past five years, he has developed diagnostic techniques using MRI technology to investigate difficult cases like Harder’s.

After one MRI, Yu found Harder’s tumor. After that, Yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the MRI scanner, allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor.

Harder finally had a diagnosis.

In 2012, he started on a treatment plan: hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate, and then external beam radiation to finish the job. Today, his PSA is normal.

Other patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from TRUS biopsies yet persistently high PSA levels may not be as fortunate.

“A patient had 10 TRUS biopsies and his doctors still couldn’t find a tumor,” Yu said. “If you do not have this kind of advanced imaging, sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can’t be found and treated because it’s too late — it has already metastasized. He ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later.”

Precise imaging leads to detection

Magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like Harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis. When caught early, prostate cancer is highly treatable.

Much like someone would have an MRI to investigate the cause of back pain, the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue. VCU Medical Center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric MRI, which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate.

Each of the sequences — T2 weighted imaging, diffusion-weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging — tells a story, and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than 90 percent accuracy.

Interpreting a prostate MRI to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop. Yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences.

“If we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy,” said Sarah Winks, M.D., an attending physician in the Department of Radiology.

An MRI can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is, Yu said, and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas — all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment.

Traditional meets emerging technology

In addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer, magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance/ultrasound fusion biopsy. MRI scans are overlaid with real-time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor.

In 2014, VCU Health’s Department of Radiology, supported by the Division of Urology in the Department of Surgery, purchased ultrasound/MRI fusion biopsy equipment. Prior to this, Yu’s team had performed targeted MRI biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the MRI scanner as the needle was guided to the target area — a sort of stop-motion procedure that could take up to an hour. The new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about 20 minutes.

A study published in 2015 by the Center for Cancer Research found that fusion biopsy is 30 percent more accurate in diagnosing high-risk, aggressive cancers than a TRUS biopsy. It is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate, near where Harder’s tumor was located.

Yu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric-MRI, read the MRI scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate.

“At most places, there will be a radiologist reading the MR image and a clinician performing the biopsy. The person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different,” Yu said. “Sometimes you don’t get the same result. We do both. That’s one of our strengths.”

New path to diagnosis

Yu has seen how MRI technology has changed prostate patients’ care. “Five years ago, 95 percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high PSA would never get any imaging,” Yu said. “Right now, I think probably 50 or 60 percent get imaging.” Sometimes, these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of Yu’s patients did last year.

Last August, Jim Grandon of Colville, Washington, discovered he had a PSA of 5.3. It was elevated from the 4.1 measurement that he had registered for a few years. The rising PSA was cause for concern. Instead of going through with an immediate TRUS biopsy recommended by his urologist, he decided to research next steps.

“With just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do, you have anywhere from 35 to 45 percent success rate,” Grandon said. “I found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over 85 percent. When I went back to my urologist, he said, ‘Why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here?’ I said, ‘Because 85 percent is better than 40 percent.’”

VCU Medical Center was one of the places Grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done, and a few phone calls later, he was on a plane flying across the country to see Yu.

On his second day in Richmond, Grandon had an MRI that showed a lesion. The next day, Yu biopsied it. On the fourth day, Grandon flew home and began researching treatment options. He opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home, and recently completed his treatment.

A change in care

More and more, physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of MRI technology for prostate care, which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment. According to the Center for Cancer Research study, MRI targeted biopsies detect 17 percent fewer low-risk tumors. These are tumors that would have never developed into a life-threatening cancer, but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily.

When Yu started prostate MRI screening in 2011, his team performed about 50 scans per year. Now, with the support of Massey Cancer Center, Urology and Radiation Oncology, they are doing about 1,200 multiparametric-MRI and 200 imaging guided biopsies per year. He estimates the volume will continue to increase because VCU will attract patients not only from the Greater Richmond area but also patients such as Grandon from other parts of the country.

Yu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care. He speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram, men would have a baseline prostate MRI and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history.",1
"FORT LAUDERDALE, Fla., July 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- New research published in Lancet Neurology and reported by CNN has found using a green tea extract (decaffeinated) in combination with cognitive training improves some measures of cognition and behavior in subjects with Down syndrome.

Eighty-seven volunteers aged 16 to 34 with Down syndrome were enrolled in the phase 2, randomized, controlled trial. The study was conducted at the IMIM-Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute in Barcelona, Spain.

Participants were randomly assigned to take the decaffeinated green tea extract or placebo for one year. All subjects also underwent cognitive training during the 12-month trial.

After one year of treatment, functional brain scans (fMRI) showed that epigallocatechin-3-gallate (EGCG)-treated subjects had improved neuronal connectivity in certain brain regions. Participants who took the green tea extract also scored significantly better on assessments of visual recognition memory, inhibitory control, and adaptive behavior compared with those who took the placebo.

""It's an important trial,"" says Dr. Steven Hirsh, director of clinical research for Life Extension in Fort Lauderdale, Fla. ""The findings are very noteworthy and support further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations. It is very encouraging that this catechin, EGCG, from green tea extract, has the potential to benefit people with Down syndrome.""

Down syndrome is a genetic condition that affects about 250,000 Americans. Individuals with Down syndrome have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome 21.

The team of researchers, led by Dr. Rafael de la Torre, program director of IMIM Hospital del Mar Medical Research Institute and study co-principal investigator, and Dr. Mara Dierssen, group leader at Center for Genomic Regulation, Barcelona, Spain, and study co-principal investigator, proposed that EGCG might have conferred these benefits by inhibiting an enzyme called DYRK1A, which has been implicated in Down syndrome and neurodegenerative conditions including Alzheimer disease.

The level of DYRK1A-positive cells is elevated in certain regions of Alzheimer disease patients' brains, and is roughly 20-fold higher in the frontal cortex, compared to normal brains. DYRK1A is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles (via tau hyperphosphorylation) and amyloid plaques, both of which are features of Alzheimer disease.

Tea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloid-beta. Several animal studies have found that EGCG and related compounds from tea suppress amyloid-beta-induced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity. Other possible mechanisms by which EGCG may influence cognition include epigenetic regulation, restoration of mitochondrial function, and anti-oxidative functions.

In an earlier pilot study supported by Life Extension, Drs. de la Torre and Dierssen's team showed that three months of EGCG treatment improved symptoms in individuals with Down syndrome, and in mice with a Down-syndrome-like condition characterized by overexpression of DYRK1A.

""We are excited that the benefits observed in the early pilot and preclinical research extended to this larger trial,"" says Luke G. Huber, ND, MBA, vice president of product innovation and scientific development at Life Extension. ""This new research adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests compounds in green tea, such as EGCG, may support cognitive health.""

In acknowledging the novelty of their findings and calling for more research, the Spanish research team noted that ""…this study is the first well-powered trial that shows improvement in adaptive behavior (functional academics) and brain-related changes in young adults with Down's syndrome. However, more research is needed to clarify the nature of the beneficial association between the EGCG and cognitive training intervention (ie, synergistic or additive).""

"International Study Finds Effective, Less Toxic Way to Treat Brain Tumors

Newswise — CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 26, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Physicians from Carolinas HealthCare System's Neurosciences Institute and Levine Cancer Institute are among the authors of a study that was accepted for publication by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The study, released on July 26, 2016, shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy. These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life.

Anthony L. Asher, MD, FACS, medical director at Carolinas HealthCare System's Neurosciences Institute and the senior author on the report, and as well as Stuart H. Burri, MD, chairman, department of radiation oncology at Levine Cancer Institute, began their research on this subject over 10 years ago in Charlotte, North Carolina. Along with Dr. Paul Brown at Mayo Clinic, they spearheaded an international, multi-institutional, randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor, brain metastases, by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness.

Typical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation, also known as stereotactic radiosurgery. ""We discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases – in other words, cancer that travels to the brain- reduces the number of new brain tumors over time; however, patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation,"" says Dr. Asher.

""Whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation,"" adds Dr. Burri. ""Interestingly, the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival.""

According to the American Cancer Society, in 2016, there will be approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. In contrast, 300,000 and 240,000 patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers, respectively, each year. ""Brain metastases are not only extremely common, they are also a major source of disability in society,"" says Dr. Asher. Because of their location, these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness or problems with speech and information processing, thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients.

According to Dr. Asher, there are two primary objectives in cancer care:

To improve survivalTo maintain or improve quality of life for patients""The first and highest rule of medical care is 'do no harm,'"" says Dr. Asher. ""Consistent with that obligation, when it isn't possible to extend survival with various therapies, it's absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments. Another way to state that principle for cancer care, is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival, it's important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life.""

In this study, although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time, its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone. Furthermore, whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life.

""In the past, clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients' daily function in response to various therapies,"" said Dr. Burri. ""Without those tests, we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better, at least in the short term. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients.""

Drs. Asher and Burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy.

The trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases. This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Drs. Asher and Burri, along with their co-investigators, now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy, and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life.

""Having the research published in JAMA is validation of more than a decade of work,"" says Dr. Burri. "" It is deeply satisfying to have developed an important scientific project, work in close collaboration with other investigators to obtain support from the National Cancer Institute, then carry the to carry the trial to completion with publication of impactful results in one of the leading medical journals in the world.""

Drs. Asher and Burri are now working on a new method of focused therapy for tumors that have spread to the brain that combines radiation and surgery. The technique was pioneered at Levine Cancer Institute and they are looking to expand and further validate the approach with the National Cancer Institute.

Newswise — BIRMINGHAM, Ala. – The Food and Drug Administration recently approved lifitegrast, a new eye drop for treating signs and symptoms of dry eye in adult patients. Kelly Nichols, O.D., Ph.D., a dry eye expert and dean of the University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Optometry, conducted research studies for the parent drug company to explore the efficacy and safety of lifitegrast in treating this eye condition that affects more than 16 million adults in the United States.

Inflammation associated with dry eye may eventually lead to damage to the surface of the eye.

“Dry eye is a common complaint to eye care professionals, with millions of U.S. adults experiencing the symptoms of this often chronic disease,” Nichols said. “It is critical for eye care professionals to have a dialogue with patients who report symptoms because dry eye can be a progressive ocular surface disease.”

The twice-daily eye drop solution of 5 percent lifitegrast ophthalmic solution is the only prescription eye drop indicated for the treatment of both signs and symptoms of dry eye, and it is the first new dry eye prescription drop approved in the last 13 years.

Nichols and a team of researchers studied 1,181 patients, of whom 1,067 received lifitegrast in four placebo-controlled 12-week trials. Signs and symptoms were assessed at baseline and at weeks two, six and 12.

In all four studies, eye dryness was significantly reduced, with two of the studies showing improvements at week two. Results from inferior corneal staining tests — used by physicians to detect abrasions on the cornea — showed improvement in three of the four studies.

Nichols continues to push for funding and advancement for dry eye research and treatment. Prior to FDA approval of the lifitegrast eye drop, Nichols presented a congressional briefing in Washington, D.C., addressing research into dry eye for the National Alliance for Eye and Vision Research. She focused on the cause and potential therapies for dry eye that are being funded through the National Eye Institute and in private industry.

Focusing her research on all aspects of the eye, Nichols discussed the mechanics of the three layers of the tear film and the importance of each from the cornea outward:• Mucin layer: helps tears adhere to the eye• Aqueous layer or water layer: nourishes and protects the cornea• Lipid or oil layer: lubricates and prevents evaporation and provides smooth refractive surface needed for optimal vision

“We are unsure which of the 200-plus different lipids and 500-plus unique proteins are most important for protecting and lubricating the eye, and the absence or insufficiency of which results in dry eye,” Nichols said.

There are more than 30-plus new dry eye basic, translational and clinical studies being funded by the NEI/National Institutes of Health to further explore these lipids and proteins, with more than 50 papers being published monthly.

“Funding from NIH is helping the optometry world make significant strides in understanding the cause and treatment of dry eye,” Nichols said. “We still have a long way to go, but prevention and early detection are major goals. There is hope for dry eye patients worldwide.”

Diagnosis of dry eye is identified by an eye care professional based on careful evaluation of signs and symptoms, including dryness, discomfort, vision changes and damage to the surface of the eye. Specialty testing for dry eye is performed at the Dry Eye Relief Clinic at UAB Eye Care, in the School of Optometry.

"ROCHESTER, Minn. — Can estrogen preserve brain function and decrease the risk of Alzheimer’s disease when given early in menopause? Newly postmenopausal women who received estrogen via a skin patch had reduced beta-amyloid deposits, the sticky plaques found in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease, a Mayo Clinic study published this month in the Journal of Alzheimer’s Disease found. Ultimately, these deposits harm neurons, leading to cognitive problems.

In the study, women with APOE e4 — one form of the most common gene associated with late-onset Alzheimer's disease — had lower levels of amyloid deposits.

“This study showed, for the first time, that the brain amyloid deposition ─ a hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease ─ is reduced in newly postmenopausal women who received 17beta-Estradiol patch form of hormone therapy,” says lead author Kejal Kantarci, M.D., a Mayo Clinic radiologist. “Women with APOE e4, who have a greater genetic risk for Alzheimer’s disease, particularly benefited from this therapy.”

MEDIA CONTACT: Susan Barber Lindquist, Mayo Clinic Public Affairs, 507-284-5005, newsbureau@mayo.edu

Menopause is defined as occurring 12 months after a woman’s last menstrual period and marks the end of menstrual cycles. In the U.S., the average age of menopause is 51. A rapid decline in estrogen with menopause may be associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease risk in women.

The Women’s Health Initiative study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) reported that menopausal hormone therapy started in women 65 or older increased the risk of dementia. In contrast, the multicenter Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study tested the hypothesis that healthy and younger women would respond to menopausal hormone therapy more favorably.

The Mayo Clinic study used data from the Kronos study to determine the effects of menopausal hormone therapy shortly after menopause, during the critical window of rapid estrogen depletion — five to 36 months past menopause. Researchers investigated the brain amyloid deposition in 68 women ages 42 to 59 who participated in the Kronos trial during this critical window. The researchers used positron emission tomography, also known as a PET scan, to look for the brain amyloid deposits three years after the trial ended.

Of the 68 women, 21 received estrogen via a skin patch, 17 received estrogen orally and 30 received a placebo. Amyloid deposition was lower in women who received the patch, compared to the placebo, and the effect was most apparent in women with the APOE e4 genotype. The oral treatment was not associated with lower amyloid deposition.

The authors are seeking funding to perform amyloid PET imaging at eight more Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention study sites around the U.S.

“If our results are confirmed in the larger group of women, this finding has the potential to change the concepts for preventive interventions that drive the Alzheimer’s disease field today,” Dr. Kantarci says. “It also may have a significant impact on women making the decision to use hormone therapy in the early postmenopausal years.”

"Newswise — WhatA research paper published in The Lancet Infectious Diseases reported that the human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine is safe and efficacious across a wide age range of women. The international study found that it protects against HPV infection in women older than 26 years. Vaccination programs worldwide currently target routine vaccination of women 26 years and younger.

The study recruited women in 12 countries across four continents. Cosette Wheeler, PhD, at The University of New Mexico Comprehensive Cancer Center, was the lead author of the report.

WhyThe human papillomaviruses cause cancer of the cervix, anus, and middle throat. Five types of HPV account for about 85 percent of all invasive cervical cancer cases. HPV vaccines are expected to prevent most of these cancer cases.

Many countries routinely vaccinate girls and boys 25 years and younger, although vaccination rates in the United States remain low. In the US, only about 40 percent of girls and 21 percent of boys receive the three-dose vaccination series. The earlier the vaccine is given, the more efficacious it can be.

This study focused on the benefit of vaccinating women 26 years and older. Infection with HPV can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to HPV. The study showed that women in this age group were still protected from HPV infections.

The scientists followed each woman for four to seven years. They found that the vaccine protected the women against HPV infections during the follow-up period and that the women were protected from many types of HPV across a broad age range. These study results are essential to new approaches in cancer prevention, particularly those that are investigating combined approaches of cervical screening and vaccination in adult women.

WhoCosette Wheeler, PhD is a UNM Regents Professor in the Departments of Pathology and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. She holds the Victor and Ruby Hansen Surface Endowed Chair in Translational Medicine and Public Health. Her New Mexico research group has contributed for over 20 years to understanding the molecular epidemiology of human papillomaviruses (HPV) in cervical precancer and cancer among Native American, Hispanic and non-Hispanic women of the southwest and on a global basis. She has overseen a number of large-scale multidisciplinary population-based projects that have ultimately enabled advances in primary (HPV vaccines) and secondary cervical cancer prevention (Pap and HPV tests).

Dr. Wheeler has authored over 200 peer-reviewed articles a number in top tier journals. In 2008 Sciencewatch (Thomson Reuters http://sciencewatch.com/ana/st/hpv/08julHPVWheler/) ranked her global citation contributions over the past decade, 7th in human papillomavirus contributions and in the top 1% in the field of clinical medicine.

"Newswise — COLORADO SPRINGS, CO – Shoulder instability is most common in the young, athletic population, bringing a focus to how these injuries are best treated. Research presented today at the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine’s (AOSSM) Annual Meeting in Colorado Springs, CO, demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery.

The study examined 121 patients at an average of 51 months post-surgery. Of this group, 68 patients had experienced their first dislocation, while 53 had recurrent dislocations after being initially treated non-operatively. After treatment with an arthroscopic bankart repair, the postoperative dislocation rate in the first-time injury group was 29%, compared to 62% in those who did not have surgery after their initial injury. The average age of patients was 19 years old.

“Deciding between a non-operative program or going forward with surgery can be a challenging decision for medical professionals treating shoulder injuries in young athletes,” noted the study’s lead author Tyler J. Marshall, MD, from Alabama Ortho Spine and Sports in Birmingham, AL. “However, this study shows a substantial benefit for athletes undergoing surgery to prevent recurrent instability down the road.”

The research data was collected between 2003 and 2013 from eight fellowship trained surgical practices, with patient ages ranging from 16 to 30 years old. Surveys given to patients during follow-ups asked for information such as test for shoulder functionality, whether patients returned to sport, postoperative instability events, and if further surgery was required on the shoulder.

“While young athletes and parents may be wary of surgery, our study shows the advantages of this treatment approach,” commented Marshall. “Physicians should counsel those with first time injuries on these benefits moving forward.”

Question Does treatment with cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) increase the rate of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma?

Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial comparing CRT vs radiotherapy alone in 168 treated patients, there was no difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years. There was a 4.0% and 8.9% absolute improvement in laryngectomy-free survival at 2 and 3 years, respectively, for CRT vs radiotherapy alone.

Meaning The results of this secondary subset analysis reveal a possible cetuximab-related benefit in laryngeal preservation.

Abstract

Importance The appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy-based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in the last 30 years.

Objective To assess the rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival in patients receiving cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) and patients receiving radiotherapy alone.

Design, Setting, and Participants Patients were enrolled in a multicenter, open-label, stratified, randomized, phase 3 study from April 1, 1999, through March 31, 2002, from 73 centers in the United States and 14 other countries. A secondary subgroup analysis of patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma was undertaken. Rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Quality of life was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire and head and neck module.

Main Outcomes and Measures Laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival.

Results Of the 424 patients included in the trial, 168 treated patients with cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx were included in this analysis (90 in the CRT group and 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). The median (range) age of the patients was 59 (40-80) years in the CRT group and 61 (35-81) years in the radiotherapy alone group. In the CRT group, 72 patients (80.0%) were male and 18 (20.0%) were female. In the radiotherapy alone group, 62 (79.5%) were male and 16 (20.5%) were female. The rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years were 87.9% for CRT vs 85.7% for radiotherapy alone, with an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). Similarly, the HR for laryngectomy-free survival comparing CRT vs radiotherapy alone was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17). This study was not powered to assess organ preservation. Median overall survival was 27 (95% CI, 20-45) vs 21 (95% CI, 17-35) months for the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups, respectively, with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.60-1.27). No differences between treatments were reported regarding overall quality of life, need for a feeding tube, or speech.

Conclusions and Relevance The results of a possible cetuximab-related laryngeal preservation benefit for patients with hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer are intriguing; these results need to be interpreted in the context of a retrospective subset analysis with limited sample size.

Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00004227

Introduction

Historically, locoregionally advanced squamous cell cancers of the larynx or hypopharynx have been treated with surgical resection, usually involving laryngectomy with or without postoperative radiotherapy.1 Although laryngectomy is an effective treatment, investigators have sought therapeutic strategies that result in voice preservation. Various modifications of surgical techniques have been explored.2-5 Alternatively, in the early 1980s, investigators evaluated curative primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery as an option for these patients.6,7 Retrospective studies8,9 that compared primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery to initial surgery with postoperative radiotherapy found similar rates of survival in patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers.

After the realization that many patients could avoid total laryngectomy with the use of primary radiotherapy, several combination chemoradiotherapy strategies were introduced for patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. In large phase 3 randomized clinical trials, induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy demonstrated equivalent overall survival compared with surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal10,11 and hypopharyngeal cancers.12 More recently, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial revealed that radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin resulted in a superior laryngeal preservation rate compared with induction with cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for these advanced laryngeal cancers.13,14 However, this treatment did not produce a survival benefit.

The appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy-based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate.15-18 Unfortunately, there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in large database studies19-21 examining the last 30 years of care. Investigators have reported that poor follow-up may contribute to the potential for larger and less curable recurrences, and surgeons experienced with radiotherapy with salvage surgery need to be involved as early as possible.20,21

The analysis described in this report was performed to assess the laryngeal preservation rates of patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers who were entered into a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) compared with radiotherapy alone.22,23 This group of patients represents a subgroup (168 patients) of a larger population (424 patients) that also included patients with oropharyngeal cancers. It is noteworthy that this randomized clinical trial was not designed to enroll a sufficient number of patients to definitively and prospectively address the subject of the analysis reported herein. Previous reports22,23 of the overall randomized clinical trial found locoregional control and survival advantages associated with the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy.

Methods

Patients

Patients were enrolled in the multicenter, open-label, stratified, randomized, phase 3 study from April 1, 1999, through March 31, 2002, from 73 centers in the United States and 14 other countries. Patients who entered the trial had stage III or IV nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx (Figure 1 and Table 1). Patients were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma, had measurable disease, had no distant metastases, had no prior therapy for the tumor under study, and were medically suitable to undergo definitive radiotherapy. This subgroup includes the patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers. The protocol was approved by the ethics review boards at the participating institutions, and all the patients provided written informed consent.

Patients were initially evaluated with a comprehensive head and neck examination, which included panendoscopy. The primary tumors and lymph nodes were staged by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification of 1998. Initial evaluation included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region and chest radiography. Patients began treatment within 2 weeks after this initial evaluation, as determined by the randomization procedure.22 Patients who underwent no surgery or less extensive operations were censored at death or date of last contact.

Treatment

The primary radiotherapy was delivered with curative intent. Investigators selected 1 of 3 radiation fractionation regimens: once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost regimen (Figure 1). Cervical lymph node drainage regions, considered to be at high risk for subclinical disease, were treated with a dose of 50 to 54 Gy. The primary tumor and gross nodal disease received full-dose radiotherapy (70-76.8 Gy, depending on fractionation). However, if a postoperative neck dissection was planned, gross nodal disease could be treated with 60 Gy.

For patients randomized to CRT, cetuximab treatment consisted of an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 and was delivered as a 120-minute intravenous infusion. This initial dose was delivered 1 week before the initiation of CRT. Patients received weekly cetuximab infusions during the radiotherapy treatment. Seven weekly infusions were delivered at a dose of 250 mg/m2 for a period of 60 minutes each.

For patients who were scheduled to have a planned neck dissection, surgery was scheduled to take place 4 to 8 weeks after completion of CRT or radiotherapy alone.

Evaluations

Evaluations, including physical examination, hematologic testing, and chemical profiles, were performed weekly for the duration of the study. A pharmacologic profile was also performed weekly on patients receiving cetuximab infusion (CRT group). Patients provided a history and underwent a physical examination, which included a fiberoptic examination of the tumor, as well as an assessment of all study end points at required time points after the completion of treatment.22 Posttreatment assessments were performed 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Patients who were scheduled for a planned postoperative neck dissection could have their 8-week assessment at the 6-week time point, along with posttreatment computed tomography. Subsequently, patients were evaluated every 4 months during the first and second years. They were evaluated semiannually during years 3 to 5. These follow-up assessments included imaging studies, consisting of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region.

Quality of Life

The instruments used in this study were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version 3.0 and the Quality of Life Head and Neck Module 35. The self-administered core questionnaire consisted of 30 questions and incorporated 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, and a global health and quality-of-life scale. The remaining single items assessed additional symptoms commonly reported by patients with cancer, as well as the perceived financial effect of disease and treatment. All scales and single items met the standards for reliability. The 35-item module comprised 1 multi-item scale and a series of single items assessing head and neck–associated symptoms and adverse effects from conventional therapy.

Statistical Analysis

The randomization was not stratified by primary site of cancer; hence, the results presented below are a retrospective analysis of the selected subset of patients. A CONSORT flow diagram was included with the original publication of the trial.23 A trial profile for the analysis presented here is shown in Figure 1. The primary end point of the study was to examine differences in the rate of locoregional disease control maintained for 1 year. The duration of locoregional control was defined as the absence of locoregional disease progression at the scheduled follow-up visits and was determined through a masked review of the investigator-generated data by an independent committee of experts. The duration of locoregional control was from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease or death from any cause. Overall survival was calculated from randomization to death from any cause. Tumor present in a neck dissection, which was performed for any reason after 15 weeks after radiotherapy, constituted locoregional progression. Distribution of time-to-event parameters was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment effects were compared using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the nonstratified hazard ratio (HR). The Kaplan-Meier method was also used to estimate the rate of preservation of larynx.24 Patients who underwent no surgery or lesser operations were censored at death or date of last contact.

Results

Characteristics of the Patients

A total of 424 patients participated in the study and 168 were included in the subanalysis (90 in the CRT group or 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). Most patients from both treatment groups were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation regimen. The 2 treatment groups were well balanced with respect to sex, tumor stage, node stage (Table 1), and the rate of neck surgery (16% in the CRT group and 14% in the radiotherapy alone group).

Treatment Adherence

The median durations of treatment were 52, 46, and 43 days for once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost, respectively, for patients treated with CRT and 52, 44, and 43 days, respectively, for patients treated with radiotherapy alone. For patients who received cetuximab, the median number of cetuximab infusions was 8 (range, 1–11). The median cumulative cetuximab dose was 2154 mg/m2 (range, 14-2887 mg/m2). The number of patients who received 7 or more cetuximab infusions was 80 (88.9%). The radiotherapy quality assurance review found that the mean and median doses for the once daily, twice daily, and concomitant boost regimens were 68.7 and 70.0 Gy, 74.3 and 74.4 Gy, and 70.8 and 72.0 Gy, respectively; these doses were similar in both treatment groups. Radiotherapy adherence for patients who received CRT or radiotherapy alone was balanced; 65 (72.2%) received CRT and 56 (71.8%) received radiotherapy alone as planned or with minor deviation. A total of 121 patients (72%) were treated as planned or with minor deviation. Major acceptable deviations in the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups were found in 13 (14.4%) and 13 (16.7%) patients, and major unacceptable deviations were observed in 3 (3.3%) and 5 (6.4%) patients, respectively. A total of 9 (10.0%) and 4 (5.1%) patients in these respective groups were not evaluable for a radiation quality assurance review. The differences in radiotherapy adherence between the 2 treatment groups were not statistically significant. Neck dissections were performed in 14 patients (15.6%) treated with CRT and 11 patients (14.1%) treated with radiotherapy alone.

Efficacy

Locoregional control was the primary end point of the phase 3 study. For this subgroup of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, locoregional control was slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.13) (Table 2). The 2-year rates of locoregional control were 36.9% in the CRT group and 25.7% in the radiotherapy alone group. Survival was also slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.60-1.27) (Table 2). The 3-year survival rates were 41.9% in the CRT group and 39.0% in the radiotherapy alone group.

The rates of laryngeal preservation (no need for salvage laryngectomy) were 87.9% at 2 and 3 years in the CRT group compared with 85.7% at 2 years and 76.8% at 3 years in the radiotherapy alone group. The 2.2% and 11.1% absolute improvements in the rates of laryngeal preservation, at 2 and 3 years, respectively, favored CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (Figure 2). However, this improvement was not statistically significant (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). In addition, there was a 4.0% and 8.9% absolute improvement in laryngectomy-free survival at 2 and 3 years, respectively. Again, these differences did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17) (Figure 2).

Safety

The most frequently reported adverse events are given in Table 3. The frequency of grades 3 and 4 mucositis/stomatitis and odynophagia was not significantly different among patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone. Patients who received CRT had a greater rate of acneiform rash compared with patients who received radiotherapy alone (Table 3). Chills, fever, and headache were the only toxic events reported to occur at any grade with significantly higher frequency (P = .002, P = .01, and P = .004, respectively) in patients in the CRT group than in the radiotherapy alone group; however, their incidences were low (chills, 16 [17.8%] vs 2 [2.6%]; fever, 20 [22.2%] vs 6 [7.7%]; headache, 20 [22.2%] vs 5 [6.4%]).

Quality of Life

The quality-of-life responses were evaluated in a longitudinal design in all patients. Baseline assessment was performed at or just after randomization. Subsequent assessments took place before the beginning of the fourth week of radiotherapy, at the 8-week posttreatment evaluation, and at the 2 every-4-month follow-up evaluations of year 1. Plots of mean changes in global health status, use of a feeding tube, or speech problems reveal no differences between the treatment groups (Figure 3). A positive value in change indicates an improvement for the patient.

Differences in mean changes in swallowing at radiotherapy week 4 (−15 in the CRT group and −25 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02), loss of appetite at radiotherapy week 4 (−11 in the CRT group and −18 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .03), nausea at week 8 after radiotherapy (−7.3 in the CRT group and 0.3 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), coughing at radiotherapy week 4 (7.4 in the CRT group and −5.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02) and at week 8 after radiotherapy (−3.2 in the CRT group and 1.1 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), constipation at month 8 (2.6 in the CRT group and −19 in the radiotherapy alone group, P < .001), and cognitive functioning at month 12 (−7.0 in the CRT group and 4.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04) were not seen at the other time points.

Discussion

When laryngectomy is the primary treatment for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, patients gradually adjust to the loss of natural phonation, but the condition substantially interferes with normal communication and social interactions.25 In addition, although the effect of the procedure on voice frequently receives the greatest consideration, the presence of the stoma may also adversely affect patients’ quality of life.26

In the analysis reported herein, laryngeal preservation rates were studied in a subgroup of patients who were part of a large phase 3 trial that compared primary radiotherapy with or without the antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab. The use of CRT produced a higher rate of laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone for patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. Although the difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation between the 2 groups did not reach statistical significance, the initial trial was not powered to assess this subgroup question. The HR of 0.57 is a strong indicator that cetuximab, when added to radiotherapy, may improve laryngeal preservation. The 87.9% rate of laryngeal preservation at 2 years for CRT found in this trial is similar to the rate reported for the use of radiotherapy and concomitant cisplatin in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial (n = 547).13

Patients who undergo a laryngectomy often experience a difficult adjustment process. Even when the patient achieves a certain level of comfort with various techniques of artificial speech,27 the ability to communicate with others is hampered.26,28,29 Investigations have explored both the patient’s and the interviewer’s perceptions of the patient’s difficulty with communication after laryngectomy.26 Of interest, the interviewers perceived the patients’ impairment with communication as a much greater infringement on quality of life compared with the patients’ perceptions. Patients who underwent laryngectomy believed that interference with social activities resulted in a greater detrimental effect regarding their quality of life compared with the interviewers’ perception of this factor. Therefore, patients have their own perceptions, as well as the perceptions of others, as potential hurdles to normal activities after laryngectomy.

The perception of life without a larynx plays an important role in a patient’s treatment decision. In a recent trial from France, 269 patients were queried about the treatment choices they might make if they faced the diagnosis of advanced laryngeal cancer.30 Only 29% stated that they would not consider options with a lower chance of cure if told that the best option, with respect to survival, was total laryngectomy. However, their enthusiasm for seeking laryngeal-preserving options waned when told about potential adverse effects, such as tracheostomy or permanent gastrostomy. An older report31 of interviews with firefighters and executives who were asked to envision that they had advanced laryngeal cancer determined that they were willing to accept a 15% to 30% reduction in life expectancy for a laryngeal-preserving treatment compared with total laryngectomy. These studies30,31 demonstrate the importance of reviewing options and potential adverse effects with patients before making a decision regarding the best treatment.

Considering the importance of laryngeal function, many head and neck cancer treatments have been directed toward the goal of laryngeal preservation. One of the largest randomized clinical trials was designed to evaluate laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.13,14 Each treatment group included at least 180 patients, thus providing much greater statistical power than the current communication. The use of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.46. However, the induction regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil did not improve laryngeal preservation over radiotherapy alone. Neither concomitant chemoradiotherapy nor induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone. Furthermore, there were greater severe acute toxic effects from the chemoradiotherapy treatments compared with radiotherapy alone,13 but no significant differences in severe late toxic effects were noted in the comparison of the 3 treatment arms.14 Unfortunately, the concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm had an increase in deaths not attributable to cancer compared with the other 2 arms; this finding needs to be explored further to determine whether undetected fatal late treatment toxic effects are greater with concomitant regimens.

Although induction chemotherapy was not used in this trial, it has been the subject of many past and recent assessments involving laryngeal preservation, as well as other efficacy and safety outcomes.10-14 A retrospective review32 of the phase 3 TAX 324 trial (Induction Chemotherapy Comparing Taxotere Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil With Standard Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil Followed by Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer) in patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers revealed that induction chemotherapy of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (n = 90) compared with cisplatin plus fluorouracil (n = 76) followed by chemoradiotherapy with weekly carboplatin resulted in significantly improved overall survival (P = .02) and progression-free survival (P = .03) for the docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil group. Among patients undergoing surgery, laryngectomy-free survival was also significantly greater with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (P = .03).

The TREMPLIN (Radiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Radiotherapy With Cetuximab After Induction Chemotherapy for Larynx Preservation) trial compared the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, followed by chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (n = 60) or cetuximab (n = 56), for laryngeal preservation.33 No differences were found in laryngeal preservation, laryngeal function preservation, or overall survival between the 2 regimens. Newer studies, such as DeCIDE (Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy Plus or Minus IC to Decrease Events in Head and Neck Cancer)34 and PARADIGM (Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation in Treating Patients With Stage III or IV Head and Neck Cancer),35 suggest no overall benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy vs concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone.

Conclusions

The higher rate of laryngeal preservation that was achieved with the use of CRT compared with radiotherapy alone was encouraging. Furthermore, no significant increases in the most debilitating radiotherapy-induced toxic effects, such as mucositis/stomatitis and dysphagia, were observed. This treatment approach warrants further evaluation in larger populations to fully assess the potential value of cetuximab or other molecular targeting agents to augment laryngeal preservation rates.

"Newswise — Eating a type of powdered food supplement, based on a molecule produced by bacteria in the gut, reduces cravings for high-calorie foods such as chocolate, cake and pizza, a new study suggests.

Scientists from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow asked 20 volunteers to consume a milkshake that either contained an ingredient called inulin-propionate ester, or a type of fibre called inulin.

Previous studies have shown bacteria in the gut release a compound called propionate when they digest the fibre inulin, which can signal to the brain to reduce appetite. However the inulin-propionate ester supplement releases much more propionate in the intestines than inulin alone.

After drinking the milkshakes, the participants in the current study underwent an MRI scan, where they were shown pictures of various low or high calorie foods such as salad, fish and vegetables or chocolate, cake and pizza.

The team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin-propionate ester, they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward -- but only when looking at the high calorie foods. These areas, called the caudate and the nucleus accumbens, found in the centre of the brain, have previously been linked to food cravings and the motivation to want a food.

The volunteers also had to rate how appealing they found the foods. The results showed when they drank the milkshake with the inulin-propionate ester supplement they rated the high calorie foods as less appealing.

In a second part of the study, which is published in July edition of the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, the volunteers were given a bowl of pasta with tomato sauce, and asked to eat as much as they like. When participants drank the inulin-propionate ester, they ate 10 per cent less pasta than when they drank the milkshake that contained inulin alone.

In a previous research study by the same team, published in 2013, they found that overweight volunteers who added the inulin-propionate ester supplement to their food every day, gained less weight over six months compared to volunteers who added only inulin to their meals.

Professor Gary Frost, senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine at Imperial, said: ""Our previous findings showed that people who ate this ingredient gained less weight -- but we did not know why. This study is filling in a missing bit of the jigsaw -- and shows that this supplement can decrease activity in brain areas associated with food reward at the same time as reducing the amount of food they eat.""

He added that eating enough fibre to naturally produce similar amounts of propionate would be difficult: ""The amount of inulin-propionate ester used in this study was 10g - which previous studies show increases propionate production by 2.5 times. To get the same increase from fibre alone, we would need to eat around 60g a day. At the moment, the UK average is 15g.""

Claire Byrne, a PhD researcher also from the Department of Medicine explained that using inulin-propionate ester as a food ingredient may help prevent weight gain: ""If we add this to foods it could reduce the urge to consume high calorie foods."" She added that some people's gut bacteria may naturally produce more propionate than others, which may be why some people seem more naturally predisposed to gain weight.

Dr Tony Goldstone, co-senior author of the study from the Department of Medicine added: ""This study adds to our previous brain imaging studies in people who have had gastric bypass surgery for obesity. These show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general, but also change how the brain responds when they see high-calorie foods, and how appealing they find the foods to be.""

Dr Douglas Morrison, author of the paper from the Scottish Universities Environmental Research Centre at the University of Glasgow, commented: ""We developed inulin-propionate ester to investigate the role of propionate produced by the gut microbiota in human health. This study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice. This study also sheds new light on how diet, the gut microbiome and health are inextricably linked adding to our understanding of how feeding our gut microbes with dietary fibre is important for healthy living.""

"Newswise — June 15, 2016/Novato and Los Angeles, CA Results from quantitative MRI and neuropsychological testing show unprecedented improvements in ten patients with early Alzheimer’s disease (AD) or its precursors following treatment with a programmatic and personalized therapy. Results from an approach dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration are now available online in the journal Aging.

The study, which comes jointly from the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and the UCLA Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research is the first to objectively show that memory loss in patients can be reversed, and improvement sustained, using a complex, 36-point therapeutic personalized program that involves comprehensive changes in diet, brain stimulation, exercise, optimization of sleep, specific pharmaceuticals and vitamins, and multiple additional steps that affect brain chemistry.

“All of these patients had either well-defined mild cognitive impairment (MCI), subjective cognitive impairment (SCI) or had been diagnosed with AD before beginning the program,” said author Dale Bredesen, MD, a professor at the Buck Institute and professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, who noted that patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work and those struggling at their jobs were able to improve their performance. “Follow up testing showed some of the patients going from abnormal to normal.”

One of the more striking cases involved a 66-year old professional man whose neuropsychological testing was compatible with a diagnoses of MCI and whose PET scan showed reduced glucose utilization indicative of AD. An MRI showed hippocampal volume at only the 17th percentile for his age. After 10 months on the protocol a follow-up MRI showed a dramatic increase of his hippocampal volume to the 75th percentile, with an associated absolute increase in volume of nearly 12 percent.

In another instance, a 69-year old professional man and entrepreneur, who was in the process of shutting down his business, went on the protocol after 11 years of progressive memory loss. After six months, his wife, co-workers and he noted improvement in memory. A life-long ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head returned and he reported an ability to remember his schedule and recognize faces at work. After 22 months on the protocol he returned for follow-up quantitative neuropsychological testing; results showed marked improvements in all categories with his long-term recall increasing from the 3rd to 84th percentile. He is expanding his business.

Another patient, a 49-year old woman who noted progressive difficulty with word finding and facial recognition went on the protocol after undergoing quantitative neuropsychological testing at a major university. She had been told she was in the early stages of cognitive decline and was therefore ineligible for an Alzheimer’s prevention program. After several months on the protocol she noted a clear improvement in recall, reading, navigating, vocabulary, mental clarity and facial recognition. Her foreign language ability had returned. Nine months after beginning the program she did a repeat of the neuropsychological testing at the same university site. She no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline.

All but one of the ten patients included in the study are at genetic risk for AD, carrying at least one copy of the APOE4 allele. Five of the patients carry two copies of APOE4 which gives them a 10-12 fold increased risk of developing AD. “We’re entering a new era,” said Bredesen. “The old advice was to avoid testing for APOE because there was nothing that could be done about it. Now we’re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention.” Sixty-five percent of the Alzheimer’s cases in this country involve APOE4; with seven million people carrying two copies of the ApoE4 allele.

Bredesen’ s systems-based approach to reverse memory loss follows the abject failure of monotherapies designed to treat AD and the success of combination therapies to treat other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease, cancer and HIV. Bredesen says decades of biomedical research, both in his and other labs, has revealed that an extensive network of molecular interactions is involved in AD pathogenesis, suggesting that a broader-based therapeutic approach may be more effective. “Imagine having a roof with 36 holes in it, and your drug patched one hole very well—the drug may have worked, a single ‘hole’ may have been fixed, but you still have 35 other leaks, and so the underlying process may not be affected much,” Bredesen said. “We think addressing multiple targets within the molecular network may be additive, or even synergistic, and that such a combinatorial approach may enhance drug candidate performance, as well.”

While encouraged by the results of the study, Bredesen admits more needs to be done. “The magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented, providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective,” Bredesen said. “Even though we see the far-reaching implications of this success, we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites.” Plans for larger studies are underway.

Cognitive decline is often listed as the major concern of older adults. Already, Alzheimer’s disease affects approximately 5.4 million Americans and 30 million people globally. Without effective prevention and treatment, the prospects for the future are bleak. By 2050, it’s estimated that 160 million people globally will have the disease, including 13 million Americans, leading to potential bankruptcy of the Medicare system. Unlike several other chronic illnesses, Alzheimer’s disease is on the rise--recent estimates suggest that AD has become the third leading cause of death in the United States behind cardiovascular disease and cancer.

THE BREDESEN PROTOCOL, Dr. Bredesen’s book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper, will be released by Penguin Random House in May 2017. Dr. Bredesen hopes to eventually transform the perception and reality of Alzheimer’s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition.

"Newswise — MAYWOOD, IL – Although surgery can prolong the lives of patients with an aggressive type of cancer called malignant pleural mesothelioma, many patients avoid the operation for fear it will degrade their quality of life.

But a study led by a Loyola Medicine thoracic surgeon has found just the opposite: Patients who underwent an operation called pleurectomy and decortication (PD) generally reported their quality of life improved after surgery.

Wickii Vigneswaran, MD, presented the study during the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Dr. Vigneswaran is division director of thoracic surgery and a professor in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine.

Malignant pleural mesothelioma is caused by environmental factors such as exposure to asbestos as well as a genetic predisposition to the cancer. It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work). Following surgery, all patients were surveyed at 1 month, 4-5 months, 7-8 months and 10-11 months.

The quality of life survey measured overall functioning (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.); general symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); individual items (shortness of breath, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) and overall health.

Improved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml. or a type of tumor cell called non-epithelioid.

“The net benefit of pleurectomy and decortication justifies the procedure in the majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma,” Dr. Vigneswaran concluded.

The study is titled “Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma.” The surgeries were performed by Dr. Vigneswaran at University of Chicago Medicine, where he practiced before recently joining Loyola.",1
"Newswise — Chicago — A single breath may be all it takes to identify the return of lung cancer after surgery, according to a study posted online today by The Annals of Thoracic Surgery.

Exhaled breath contains thousands of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) that vary in composition and pattern depending on a person’s health status. A subset of four VOCs—called carbonyl compounds because of their carbon base—have been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients. Being able to identify this lung cancer “signature” through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease. Now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence.

Erin M. Schumer, MD, MPH, Victor van Berkel, MD, PhD, and colleagues from the University of Louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from 31 lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl VOCs levels with samples from 187 healthy patients.

The researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl VOC levels following surgery; in fact, three of the four carbonyl VOCs normalized after surgery, matching levels in the control group.

“The rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment,” said Dr. Schumer. “This study confirms that the technology is accurate.”

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death. The American Cancer Society (ACS) estimates that more than 224,000 Americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year, and more than 158,000 lung cancer patients will die—that translates to 433 lung cancer deaths per day in the United States.

Dr. Schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection, “We hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms, when we have more options for treating them, giving them the best chance for cure.”

Currently, lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography (CT) scans, which can be inconvenient, expensive, and expose the patient to radiation. “We hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a CT scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change,” said Dr. van Berkel.

How the Breath Test WorksThe process of breath analysis is relatively simple. The patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon. The balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip (smaller than a quarter), trapping the chemicals. The microchip is sent to the lab, where the chemicals are analyzed within hours. Breath collection can be performed in the doctor’s office. The pump is reusable; the balloon, microchip, and lab test together cost around $20, all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost-effective, easy-to-perform, non-invasive, and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer.

“The great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point, both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated,” said Dr. van Berkel. “The technology is pretty robust. Our next step is getting approval from the FDA.”

"Newswise — New Brunswick, N.J. – June 2, 2016 – According to the American Cancer Society, the chance of being diagnosed with thyroid cancer has risen rapidly in the United States in recent years. This appears to be due to increased use of technology to detect thyroid nodules that may not otherwise been found previously. Most thyroid cancers can be treated successfully, but advanced cases can be difficult to treat, especially if they do not respond to radioactive iodine (RAI) therapy. New treatments called ‘immunotherapies’ are being explored. They target a certain protein that has the ability to shut down T cells – a part of white blood cells that help the body fight infection and disease naturally. In blocking this activity, these new immunotherapy drugs help T cells get back to work in protecting the body.

Janice M. Mehnert, MD, director of the Phase I and Developmental Therapeutics Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey, is the lead author of research highlighting the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and its effect on advanced thyroid cancer. The work is being presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) Annual Meeting which begins tomorrow in Chicago. Dr. Mehnert, who is also a medical oncologist in the Melanoma and Soft Tissue Oncology Program at Rutgers Cancer Institute, shares more about the research:

Q: How was the study structured?A: At the time our abstract was submitted, 22 patients with a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer who failed prior standard therapy were accrued from multiple international sites. Participants received 10 mg of pembrolizumab every two weeks for up to 24 months or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity. Safety, tolerability and response were assessed every eight weeks for the first six months and every 12 weeks thereafter.

Q: What did you find?A: At the time we reported our results, six of the 22 patients remained on treatment. Of those who completed therapy, two patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of 9.1 percent, and there was a stable disease rate of 54.5 percent. The six-month overall survival rate was 100 percent and the six month progression free survival rate was 58.7 percent. Updated results will be announced at the annual meeting. There were no treatment-related deaths or therapy discontinuations due to drug-related adverse effects. Overall, pembrolizumab shows promising antitumor activity in advanced cases of follicular or papillary thyroid cancer which progressed on standard treatment. The clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced thyroid cancer will be further studied in a follow-up phase II clinical trial that is now ongoing to try to discover biomarkers which predict response to treatment with pembrolizumab.

Q: How are immunotherapy drugs changing the landscape of cancer treatment?A: Although many patients treated do not respond, when immunotherapy does induce responses in patients with advanced cancers, these responses may be very long lasting in terms of disease control. As well, at least when used as single agents, these agents tend to confer side effects that patients find much more tolerable than those associated with chemotherapy. It’s an exciting time in early phase drug development when we are observing these results in so many different types of cancer.

"Newswise — An international team led by researchers at the Austrian Institute of Molecular Biotechnology (IMBA) in Vienna and the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore discovered that genetically determined breast cancer can be largely prevented by blocking a bone gene. An already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug.

About one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime. Causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors, but also gene mutations like in the BRCA1 gene (BReast CAncer). US actress Angelina Jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a „faulty“ BRCA1 gene. On average, women with this mutation have an up to 87% lifetime risk of developing breast cancer. Tumors usually develop early in life. Until now, prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk, but which is also often associated with postoperative complications.

In 2010, Josef Penninger, the scientific director of IMBA in Vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer (Schramek et al., Nature) through proteins called RANKL and its receptor RANK, which are key factors in bone metabolism. RANKL and RANK also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow. This occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle. However, if deregulated, mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should, ultimately resulting in breast cancer.

A multinational research effort now made the discovery that RANKL is also the main driver of BRCA1 mutation-driven breast cancer. In the current study, Verena Sigl, graduate student from Penninger's research group, showed that blocking the RANKL/RANK system in BRCA1 mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group. To determine the relevance of their results for humans, scientists in Vienna and Toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their BRCA1 mutation. In the human cell culture, too, RANKL inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells. Moreover, the scientists – together with colleagues in Barcelona and from the CIMBA* consortium mapping more than 23,000 women – showed that genetic variants in the RANK gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry BRCA1 and also BRCA2 mutations.

""Our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against RANKL called „Denosumab”. It is an antibody with very few side effects, which binds tightly to RANKL, thereby inhibiting its ability to act. Based on our discovery, the already approved drug Denosumab or other future drugs that will block RANKL/RANK, could be used for breast cancer prevention in BRCA mutation carriers,"" explains Verena Sigl.

Scientists at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a RANKL blocking drug in mice. Animals carrying BRCA1 mutations were divided into two groups. In the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed. The second group received RANKL blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation.

Careful phase III clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans. Thereafter, any woman who has been tested positive for a BRCA1 mutation could take RANKL blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk. Josef Penninger adds: “This work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision: Prevention of breast cancer. Cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today, a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place. We have also shown that RANKL/RANK are critically involved in sex hormone-driven breast cancer. If the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients, this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general. One door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast.”

The present work is the result of international collaboration. Scientists from Austria (IMBA, AKH Wien) participated as well as researchers from the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore and the University of Maryland-Baltimore County, Baltimore, USA; Toronto, Canada and Barcelona, Spain.

"FAIRFIELD, N.J., May 23, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --

Medimetriks, in collaboration with Otsuka, announces the successful completion of a Phase 2 trial of MM36 (previously known as OPA-15406) in Atopic Dermatitis (AD)

MM36 is a topical phosphodiesterase 4 (PDE4) inhibitor under development for the treatment of AD

Results showed a therapeutic benefit as measured by percentage change in EASI score and improvement in IGA score

MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor available in the US and may offer unique benefits for patients suffering from AD

Medimetriks Pharmaceuticals, Inc. today announces the publication of Phase 2 results for MM36 (previously referred to as OPA-15406), a novel topical non-steroidal phosphodiesterase IV (PDE4) inhibitor for the treatment of mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis.

The successful results of the Phase 2 trial of MM36 have been published by the Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology (JAAD), the leading peer-reviewed journal in dermatology. The randomized, double-blind, vehicle-controlled study in 121 patients showed that MM36 demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in IGA score (Investigators Global Assessment) and percentage change in EASI score (Eczema Area and Severity Index). The mean percentage improvement in baseline EASI score was notable very early at week 1 (31.4% vs. 6% for vehicle; p=.0005) and at week 2 (39.0% vs. 3% for vehicle; p=.0001). These effects were sustained through week 8 of the study. MM36 was also associated with improvement in patient-reported outcomes, most notably rapid and sustained itch relief, with Visual Analog Scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week (36.4% mean change; p=.0011).

MM36, a PDE4 inhibitor, reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation. MM36 is expected to be the 2nd topical PDE4 inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of Anacor Pharmaceuticals' crisaborole product.

""The results of the Phase 2 study suggest that MM36 represents a potentially safe, effective and well-tolerated non-steroidal treatment for mild-to-moderate atopic dermatitis,"" said Linda Stein Gold, MD, director of clinical research, Department of Dermatology at Henry Ford Hospital and co-author of the article. ""Based on the results of this study, it appears that MM36 could address an important unmet need in dermatology.""

""We are pleased that JAAD, the most respected peer-reviewed journal in dermatology, published the Phase 2 results,"" said Bradley Glassman, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of Medimetriks. ""We believe these Phase 2 results demonstrate compelling evidence of MM36's capacity to be a leading topical PDE4 inhibitor and are aggressively developing MM36 for atopic dermatitis in the US. Atopic Dermatitis patients have few treatment options and Medimetriks is dedicated to addressing this important unmet need.""

The JAAD article discussing the Phase 2 results can be found by visiting www.jaad.org.

About Atopic Dermatitis

Atopic dermatitis (AD) is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red, swollen and cracked skin with intense itching. The onset of AD occurs most commonly between 3 and 6 months of age, with approximately 60% of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and 90% by 5 years of age. The majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood, although 10% to 30% of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives. A small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults. It has been estimated that approximately 18 million people are living with AD in the U.S. and this disease accounts for up to 20% of patient visits to dermatology offices.

Current treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors. Topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti-inflammatory agents. However, topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time, including skin atrophy, acne and telangiectasias locally, and HPA axis suppression systemically. Topical calcineurin inhibitors (TCIs) are recommended as second-line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid-related side effects. TCIs carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma, although studies have not demonstrated a clear link. Their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging.

About MM36

Medimetriks has sole, exclusive US rights to MM36. Discovered by Otsuka, MM36 is an investigational non-steroidal topical anti-inflammatory PDE-4 inhibitor in development for the potential treatment of atopic dermatitis. MM36 is hypothesized to exert anti-inflammatory action by inhibiting the production of cytokines and chemical mediators thought to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis. In particular, MM36 exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against PDE4 subtype B, which is an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation.

"JERUSALEM, May 18, 2016 /PRNewswire/ --

Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc. (NASDAQ: ORMP), today announced positive top-line results from its Phase IIb study, designed to evaluate the safety and efficacy of its oral insulin capsule (ORMD-0801) in patients with type 2 diabetes. The study's primary objective, a significant reduction of weighted mean night-time glucose, was successfully achieved.

""This demonstration of safe and effective oral insulin delivery represents a transformative event in the treatment of type 2 diabetes,"" said Nadav Kidron, Oramed CEO. ""We are delighted with the results and look forward to moving into Phase III trials.""

This US based double blind, 28 day, randomized study of 180 adult type 2 diabetic patients showed a statistically significant decrease in the primary endpoint, pooled night-time glucose mean percentage change of 6.47% from run-in, between placebo and active cohorts (p=0.0268). The study additionally demonstrated a good safety profile with no drug related serious adverse events.

""These are very impressive results that confirm the efficacy of orally delivered intestinally absorbed insulin,"" said Dr. Michael Berelowitz, Head of Oramed's Scientific Advisory Board. ""The promise of this more physiological delivery system for insulin is the inhibition of hepatic glucose production, which was clearly demonstrated via the significant reduction in night-time glucose levels in patients who received ORMD-0801.""

The Company plans to present and publish more comprehensive data in the future.

Conference Call today, May 18, at 11:00 am Eastern Time

Oramed will host a conference call to discuss the study results.

Interested parties may access the call at: +1-866-254-0808 (US) or +44-145-254-1003 (UK). Conference ID: 8327230

About the Phase IIb Oral Insulin Study

The double-blind, randomized Phase IIb study of 180 patients with type 2 diabetes was initiated on June 30, 2015 and was conducted at 33 clinical sites in the United States under an IND that was approved by the FDA. The study was designed to generate data to assess the safety and efficacy of multiple oral bedtime doses of ORMD-0801 in adult patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus who are inadequately controlled with diet and metformin. The study was comprised of three arms: placebo, ORMD-0801 16mg and ORMD-0801 24 mg. Patients were dosed before bed-time, and their night-time glucose levels (6 hours post dose) were continuously monitored.

For more information on the study, which does not form a part of this press release, see: https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02496000?term=oramed&rank=5

About ORMD-0801

ORMD-0801 has the potential to create a new paradigm in the treatment of diabetes by oral delivery of insulin at an earlier stage of treatment, potentially slowing disease progression and delaying or even eliminating late-stage complications. Orally administered insulin is expected to enhance patient compliance. In addition, intestinally absorbed-oral insulin mimics insulin's natural location and gradients in the body by first passing through the liver before entering the bloodstream.

"SAN DIEGO, Calif., May 8, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- LCPN10, a novel oral testosterone undecanoate formulation has been shown to be safe and efficacious for the treatment of hypogonadal patients, according to a study being presented during the 111th Annual Scientific Meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA).

The research will be highlighted by study authors during a special press conference to be moderated by Tobias S. Köhler, MD, MPH, FACS, AUA spokesperson and associate professor of Surgery at Southern Illinois University on May 8, 2016 at 7:30 a.m. PT in the San Diego Convention Center.

Testosterone therapy is used to treat men with clinically diagnosed testosterone deficiency (serum T levels <300 ng/dL), also known as hypogonadism. It is often administered as a gel, patch, injection or implant (pellet). There is currently no oral form of testosterone therapy approved for use in the United States by the Federal Drug Agency; however researchers from Houston, TX and Torrance, CA have been evaluating the long-term safety and tolerability of LPCN 1021, a novel oral testosterone undecanoate formulation for the treatment of low testosterone.

Throughout a 52-week study period, a total of 315 hypogonadal men were randomized either to LPCN 1021 or T gel (active control). Of the 315 men, 210 were randomized to LPCN 1021 and 105 were randomized to active control. Following a 13-week efficacy phase, men continued to receive their assigned treatment for up to 52 weeks. They returned at weeks 26, 39 and 52 for safety assessments, which included an evaluation of adverse events, clinical laboratory tests and physical examinations.

Results showed:

LPCN 1021 was well tolerated and had a favorable safety profile in the long-term management of hypogonadal patients

No hepatic, cardiac or drug-related serious adverse events were reported

The most common drug-related adverse events for LPCN 1021 and T gel 1.62 percent were acne (2.9 percent vs. 2.9 percent, respectively), headache (0.5 percent vs. 3.8 percent, respectively), weight increase (2.4 percent vs. 0 percent, respectively), hematocrit increase (1.9 percent vs. 0 percent, respectively), liver enzyme level increase (1.4 percent vs. 0 percent, respectively), fatigue (0.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent, respectively), and hypertension (0.5 percent vs. 1.9 percent, respectively)

Lipid parameters (i.e., cholesterol, LDL, HDL, and TG) were comparable between treatment groups at Week 52

Androgenic parameters including hematocrit, hemoglobin, platelet, prothrombin, and prostate-specific antigen (PSA) showed no significant differences in change from baseline to end of study between treatments

""Based on the results of this study, we might be closer than ever to having an oral form of therapy to treat the millions of men with hypogonadism,"" said Dr. Köhler. ""Making sure an oral treatment is safe and effective for men and for the children and partners at risk for inadvertent testosterone transference is the top priority, and what we've found so far has shown we're on the right track.""

"A key objective of medication-assisted treatment for opioid use disorder is to reduce or eliminate the use of illicit opioids. The results from the present Phase 2 study demonstrate that CAM2038 blocks effectively the subjective effects of opioid challenges with hydromorphone, including limiting drug liking.

""This study provides clinical proof of concept that CAM2038 will be an effective treatment for opioid use disorder,"" said Behshad Sheldon, President and CEO of Braeburn Pharmaceuticals, ""The current opioid crisis demands innovation, and CAM2038's novel technology is now one step closer to providing physicians and patients with a different approach to treating this deadly chronic disease.""

The primary endpoint was met for both CAM2038 doses, demonstrating blockade of the subjective effects of hydromorphone as measured by the Drug Liking Visual Analog Scale. Furthermore, CAM2038 was well tolerated across the course of treatment.

""The study results show that CAM2038 provides rapid and extended blockade of opioid effects,"" said Fredrik Tiberg, President and CEO of Camurus. ""The results also confirm the dose selection in the current Phase 3 program and the potential of CAM2038 as a future treatment alternative for patients with opioid use disorder, from initiation to long-term maintenance.""

""The current study demonstrated that weekly injections of CAM2038 produced significant and robust opioid blockade, a critical mechanism of efficacy for medications treating opioid dependence. CAM2038 has the potential to alter the current treatment paradigm for opioid dependence,"" said Sharon Walsh, Ph.D, Professor of Behavioral Science and Director of the Center on Drug and Alcohol Research, University of Kentucky, ""Because of its long acting properties, CAM2038 may decrease patient and physician burden, improve access to treatment, and obviate public health concerns about illicit diversion of buprenorphine.""

""We were pleased to be involved in the development of CAM2038 and are hopeful that it will serve as another safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with opioid use disorder. The ability of CAM2038 to produce a long-lasting and robust blockade of hydromorphone-induced Drug Liking is especially encouraging,"" said Sandra D. Comer, Ph.D, Professor of Neurobiology, Columbia University. ""Importantly, the fact that CAM2038 will be given in the clinic by health providers should address concerns about diversion of buprenorphine for illicit use. We feel that this medication, with its ease of administration and flexible dosing capabilities, could significantly improve management of patients.""

About the Phase 2 Trial

The Phase 2 study was a three-center, randomized, double-blind, inpatient study to evaluate the degree of subjective opioid blocking efficacy of CAM2038 q1w in non-treatment-seeking participants with moderate-to-severe opioid use disorder. After screening, participants were randomized to different CAM2038 q1w once-weekly injections for two weeks. During this period, four challenge sessions were conducted with a randomized hydromorphone dose to determine subjective 'liking' score based on a visual analogue scale. Additional information on the design of the trial can be found at www.clinicaltrials.gov .

About CAM2038

The investigational CAM2038 buprenorphine subcutaneous injection products for treatment of opioid use disorder are being developed as once-weekly and once-monthly formulations, each with multiple doses, to cover all phases of treatment from initiation through maintenance. The CAM2038 products are designed for administration by healthcare personnel to ensure proper delivery that minimizes the risks of diversion, abuse, misuse, and accidental exposure. The CAM2038 products have been evaluated in three Phase 1/2 clinical trials, which evaluated the safety and tolerability as well as pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties of the products in a total of 176 individuals (opioid-dependent patients and healthy volunteers under naltrexone blockage). Four more trials, including two Phase 3 studies, are currently ongoing. CAM2038 is also being developed for treatment of chronic pain.

"For Immediate Release: April 29, 2016

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Nuplazid (pimavanserin) tablets, the first drug approved to treat hallucinations and delusions associated with psychosis experienced by some people with Parkinson’s disease.

Hallucinations or delusions can occur in as many as 50 percent of patients with Parkinson’s disease at some time during the course of their illness. People who experience them see or hear things that are not there (hallucinations) and/or have false beliefs (delusions). The hallucinations and delusions experienced with Parkinson’s disease are serious symptoms, and can lead to thinking and emotions that are so impaired that the people experiencing them may not relate to loved ones well or take appropriate care of themselves.

“Hallucinations and delusions can be profoundly disturbing and disabling,” said Mitchell Mathis, M.D., director of the Division of Psychiatry Products in the FDA’s Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. “Nuplazid represents an important treatment for people with Parkinson’s disease who experience these symptoms.”

An estimated 50,000 Americans are diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease each year, according to the National Institutes of Health, and about one million Americans have the condition. The neurological disorder typically occurs in people over age 60, when cells in the brain that produce a chemical called dopamine become impaired or die. Dopamine helps transmit signals between the areas of the brain that produce smooth, purposeful movement -- like eating, writing and shaving. Early symptoms of the disease are subtle and occur gradually. In some people Parkinson’s disease progresses more quickly than in others. As the disease progresses, the shaking, or tremor, which affects the majority of people with Parkinson’s disease, may begin to interfere with daily activities. Other symptoms may include depression and other emotional changes; hallucinations and delusions; difficulty in swallowing, chewing, and speaking; urinary problems or constipation; skin problems; and sleep disruptions.

The effectiveness of Nuplazid was shown in a six-week clinical trial of 199 participants. Nuplazid was shown to be superior to placebo in decreasing the frequency and/or severity of hallucinations and delusions without worsening the primary motor symptoms of Parkinson’s disease.

As with other atypical antipsychotic drugs, Nuplazid has a Boxed Warning alerting health care professionals about an increased risk of death associated with the use of these drugs to treat older people with dementia-related psychosis. No drug in this class is approved to treat patients with dementia-related psychosis.

In clinical trials, the most common side effects reported by participants taking Nuplazid were: swelling, usually of the ankles, legs, and feet due to the accumulation of excessive fluid in the tissue (peripheral edema); nausea; and abnormal state of mind (confused state).

Nuplazid was granted breakthrough therapy designation for the treatment of hallucinations and delusions associated with Parkinson’s disease. Breakthrough therapy designation is a program designed to expedite the development and review of drugs that are intended to treat a serious condition and where preliminary clinical evidence indicates that the drug may demonstrate substantial improvement over available therapy on a clinically significant endpoint. The drug was also granted a priority review. The FDA’s priority review program provides for an expedited review of drugs that offer a significant improvement in the safety or effectiveness for the treatment, prevention, or diagnosis of a serious condition.

Nuplazid is marketed by Acadia Pharmaceuticals Inc. of San Diego, California.

The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.

"MARLBOROUGH, Mass., April 26, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Hologic, Inc. (Nasdaq: HOLX) announced that study results published today in a research letter in JAMA conclude that breast tomosynthesis (Hologic's Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™) exams reduce recall rates, and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts. These key benefits of 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ could lower the costs associated with needless follow-up exams, and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram.

Density is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system, and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast. Higher breast density may increase a woman's chance of getting breast cancer, make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult, and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging.1,2 Mammograms are categorized into four density groups: almost entirely fat, scattered fibroglandular densities, heterogeneously dense, and extremely dense. The latter two groups are considered dense; however, the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue.

""Density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images, which often results in additional visits and exams for women,"" said Edward Evantash, MD, board certified OB/GYN and Medical Director for Hologic. ""This new analysis confirms that Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams reduce unnecessary follow-up exams in dense-breasted women. This has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings, reduce patient stress and expenses, and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients.""

Improvements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts, with a 50 percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous 14 percent reduction in recall rate. Women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about 40 percent of the U.S. screening population (women ages 40-74) — approximately 25 million women in the U.S.

""Utilizing Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing, and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies— addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems,"" said Pete Valenti, Hologic's Division President, Breast and Skeletal Health Solutions. ""Twenty-six states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts — and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer.""

This study brought together the principal investigators from the groundbreaking 2014 study on 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams, also published in JAMA, this time led by Elizabeth Rafferty, MD, a co-author on the prior study.3 A total of 452,320 examinations (278,906 conventional mammograms compared to 173,414 Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams), were analyzed.

Genius™ 3D MAMMOGRAPHY™ exams have been available in the U.S. since 2011, and are only available on the Hologic Selenia® Dimensions® mammography system. In 2015 an estimated 10 million women in the U.S. benefited from a Genius™ exam. Additional information, as well as a locator to find imaging sites offering the exams, can be found at http://mygenius3d.com.

"Websites aren't telling full story on tobacco product risks

“The evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources. ”

BUFFALO, N.Y. – Millions of people visit the websites of the Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, among others, seeking authoritative health information. But are they receiving it?

When it comes to learning about the differences in risk among certain types of nicotine products, many government websites are actually misleading or under-informing the public, according to two researchers who analyzed the content of numerous health websites.

This ""information quarantine"" in turn helps explain the woeful lack of public knowledge about relative risks, violating basic consumer rights as well as the public health principles of individual rights and health literacy, the researchers say.



Writing in the International Journal of Drug Policy, Lynn Kozlowski of the University at Buffalo and David Sweanor of the University of Ottawa point out that many websites omit information showing that products such as e-cigarettes, smokeless tobacco and snus are far less harmful than traditional cigarettes.

“Public health ethics always has a concern to avoid any net harm to population health,” explains Kozlowski, professor of community health and health behavior at UB and the paper’s lead author.

“The fear has been that much safer tobacco and nicotine products like snus, smokeless tobacco and vape will possibly cause a net loss to public health because more people will use these products and these products may lead to cigarette use. This fear, however, is not based on actual evidence and cannot be used to suppress or otherwise keep the public uninformed of what is clearly known about the lower risks of these products,” adds Kozlowski, PhD, one of the world’s leading researchers on smoking behavior.

An information quarantine functions similarly to a medical quarantine – think of your favorite zombie movie or television show in which the infected person is secluded from everyone else to protect the overall public. In order to justify a quarantine, there has to be clear evidence that the need to protect population health should overrule personal autonomy.

In the case of providing information on differential health risks of nicotine products, “The evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources,” Kozlowski says.

Kozlowski and Sweanor reviewed several major health websites — including the CDC, Mayo Clinic, American Cancer Society, Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the National Cancer Institute — and found three types of examples of information on smokeless tobacco, “but no-to-modest efforts to inform consumers of the significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes for lifelong users,” the researchers write.

In fact, they found that the Mayo Clinic perpetuated a misrepresentation discovered in 2003 — erroneously informing visitors that smokeless tobacco was as dangerous as cigarettes. The day after the article was released, the Mayo Clinic removed the headline, replacing it with the still misleading statement that smokeless tobacco was “not a safe product.”

“People can only make as good a decision as the information available to them allows,” said Sweanor, an adjunct professor in the University of Ottawa’s Faculty of Law who has spearheaded the development of world-leading tobacco control initiatives in Canada since the early 1980s.

“The public is dramatically misinformed about the relative risks of substitutable tobacco and nicotine products. The risk differentials are huge, but this is simply not known by a vast majority of those whose lives are at risk,” adds Sweanor.

England has an example of a website — Action on Smoking and Health (ASH) — that gets it right on vaping, the researchers said. A briefing posted on the site specifically states: “Compared to tobacco products, electronic cigarettes are significantly safer.”

In their paper, the researchers note that information on comparative risks is common for other products and activities, like over-the-counter medicines and even safety ratings of vehicles.

They argue that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), which regulates the sale of tobacco products, isn’t doing its part to inform consumers of important differences in harm among tobacco products.

To illustrate their point, Kozlowski and Sweanor use the example that if one type of alcoholic beverage caused 3 in 5 regular users to die prematurely — as is the case with smoking traditional cigarettes — while another caused massively fewer deaths, consumers would want to know which product was the safer alternative.

“It would be scandalous, even criminal, to keep such facts from consumers,” the researchers write. “Yet, such facts are being kept from adult consumers of legal tobacco/nicotine products, either by not informing or actively misinforming consumers. It is as if tobacco consumers were blindfolded and not allowed to see dramatic differences in harm from different products.”",1
"VANCOUVER, British Columbia, April 13, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Mapping blood flow in the brain of athletes using an advanced form of ultrasound may make it easier to more accurately recognize concussions, according to a study released today that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 68th Annual Meeting in Vancouver, Canada, April 15 to 21, 2016.

""There is growing evidence that concussions can change the blood flow in the brain,"" said study author Robert Hamilton, PhD, co-founder of Neural Analytics in Los Angeles, Calif., and a member of the American Academy of Neurology. ""While such changes may be detected with MRI, we believe there may be a less expensive and portable way to measure these changes with a transcranial Doppler (TCD) device.""

More than one million athletes experience a concussion each year in the United States.

TCD uses ultrasound to map blood flow activity in the brain. Traditionally, it has measured variables like the speed and variability (pulse) of blood flowing through the arteries. But those measurements haven't been enough to accurately detect concussion.

For this study, researchers used an advanced version of TCD ultrasound to get a more complete picture of just how the blood moves through the middle cerebral artery, one of the three major arteries in the brain.

Researchers compared a group of 66 high school athletes in contact sports who had been recently diagnosed with a concussion to a control group of 169 high school student athletes from both contact and non-contact sports. Examples of collision sports included in the study were football, soccer, basketball, hockey, water polo and lacrosse. The non-contact sports included were cheerleading, cross country, cycling, tennis and track. Both the control and concussion groups were approximately 30 percent female.

Each of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury. They were also given a general concussion evaluation and had their blood pressure checked.

The study found that the advanced version of TCD ultrasound was able to differentiate between healthy and concussed athletes 83 percent of the time. This is in contrast to traditional TCD ultrasound measurements like change in cerebral blood flow reactivity which differentiated between the two 60 percent of the time, average blood flow speed which differentiated 55 percent of the time and blood flow resistance which differentiated 53 percent of the time.

""This research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion,"" said Hamilton. ""While more research is needed, the hope is such a tool could one day be used on the sidelines to help determine more quickly whether an athlete needs further testing.""

""This important work provides insight into a tool that may yet prove useful in the recognition and management of concussion,"" said Jeffrey Kutcher, MD, FAAN, with the The Sports Neurology Clinic in Brighton, Michigan. ""The potential of having an accessible technology that detects a physiological change following brain trauma is very exciting. However, what these detected blood flow changes mean to a patient's clinical care is still unclear.""

""This is an important area of research. Testing of the TCD technique at the sideline at the time of injury will be an important next step to determine its ultimate utility,"" said Randolph S. Marshall, MD, MS, with Columbia Presbyterian Medical Center in New York and a member of the American Academy of Neurology's Science Committee.

The study was supported by the National Institutes of Health and the National Science Foundation.

• Study addresses key U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirement, keeping SHP465 on track for potential 2017 U.S. launch

• Topline data revealed SHP465 met primary endpoint, showing ADHD symptom improvement in children and adolescents (p<0.001)

• Key secondary endpoint also met, showing higher proportion of patients were rated improved (p<0.001)

• Data add to overall robust clinical development program for SHP465

Shire plc (LSE: SHP,NASDAQ: SHPG) today announces positive topline results from a four-week Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization, safety and efficacy study, SHP465-305, in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). SHP465 (triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts - MAS) is an investigational oral stimulant medication being evaluated in the U.S. as a potential treatment for ADHD, a therapeutic area with significant need for additional treatment options.

The primary efficacy analysis of study 305 demonstrated that SHP465, administered as a daily morning dose, was superior to placebo on the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV (ADHD rating scale) total score, with a Least Squares (LS) mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -9.9 (95% CI: -13.0 to -6.8, p<0.001), suggesting a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. SHP465 was also superior to placebo in the key secondary efficacy analysis on the clinical global impression improvement scale (CGI-I), with an LS mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -0.8 (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.5, p<0.001), indicating a significantly higher proportion of patients were rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale. The CGI-I is a standardized assessment tool that allows clinicians to rate the severity of ADHD illness, change over time and efficacy of medication.

Treatment-emergent adverse events ≥ 5% for SHP 465-305 were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea, weight decrease and dizziness. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those observed in previous SHP465 studies and with other amphetamine compounds.

The completion of SHP465-305 addresses an FDA requirement to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHP465 in children and adolescents prior to filing a Class 2 resubmission of the medicine for FDA approval.

""We are pleased with the positive results of the SHP465-305 study,"" said Philip J. Vickers, Ph.D., Head of Research & Development, Shire. ""These results represent an important step toward a new treatment option for patients with ADHD. Shire looks forward to including these data as part of the FDA resubmission and is eager to continue advancing this clinical program.""

Dr. Matthew Brams, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine and principal investigator for study 305, added: ""The study of SHP465 in children and adolescents is an essential next step to progressing the clinical program. I'm excited about these positive data from SHP465-305 because of the benefit that this potential new treatment option may provide for patients with ADHD.""

Overall Robust SHP465 Clinical Development Program to Support Class 2 Resubmission

Including study 305 and previous studies, Shire now has a robust database of 15 clinical studies evaluating SHP465 in more than 1,100 subjects. Once the pharmacokinetic study and an additional safety and efficacy Phase 3 trial in adults currently under way are complete later this year, Shire plans to add these study results to its existing SHP465 data set to submit a Class 2 resubmission for FDA approval of the medicine for treatment of ADHD. SHP465 remains on track for potential U.S. launch in the second half of 2017.

In previous adolescent and adult clinical studies, SHP465 demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo at 16 hours post dosing, with onset of action starting 4 hours post dosing, as measured by the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP). PERMP was not measured in the SHP465-305 study.

Protection for Shire's ADHD Franchise Extends to 2029

There are patents supporting Shire's overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of 2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.

"RICHMOND, Va., March 29, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- kaléo, a privately-held pharmaceutical company, today announced that EVZIO® (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injectors have been reported to help save more than 1000 lives.

EVZIO was the first naloxone product specifically designed, FDA approved and labeled for the emergency treatment of opioid overdose by individuals without medical training. EVZIO is an intelligent Auto-injection system that provides simple, on-the-spot voice and visual guidance.

""In Baltimore, we believe that naloxone should be a part of everyone's medicine cabinet and everyone's first aid kit. If we don't save lives today, there is no chance for a better tomorrow,"" said Baltimore City Health Commissioner Dr. Leana Wen. ""Having EVZIO available in Baltimore is helping us do everything possible to help prevent opioid overdose deaths in our community and across the country.""

""The opioid epidemic is killing 79 people each day— the equivalent of a fully loaded 747 airplane crashing each and every week. We can't stand by and hope that things change on their own,"" said Spencer Williamson, President and CEO of kaléo. ""By empowering more patients to have access to this potentially life-saving medicine, we believe that EVZIO will help reduce the burden of opioid overdose in the United States. Since October 2014, we have received reports that EVZIO Auto-injectors have helped save an average of 14 lives per week.""

""People at an overdose scene may be very emotional, so it really helps that EVZIO has audio instructions on how to administer this potentially life-saving medication,"" said Laurie Fugitt, RN, BSN, co-founder of Georgia Overdose Prevention. ""It has already helped save many, many lives in Georgia.""

""The Cabell-Huntington Health Department is pleased to have EVZIO in our community,"" said Dr. Michael Kilkenny, Physician Director of the Cabell-Huntington Health Department in Huntington, West Virginia. ""Following initial deployment of EVZIO on February 3, we had a confirmed life saved on February 12th. Our community is in a crisis as a result of opioid overdoses and EVZIO has provided an outstanding tool to help combat the harmful effects and death resulting from heroin and opioid use.""

""The Sarasota County Sheriff's Office (SCSO) has found the naloxone Auto-injector to be an outstanding addition to our first responder capabilities,"" said Captain Charlie Thorpe. ""Deputies now have instant access to this potentially life-saving tool since our field deployment in December 2015. Opioid overdoses continue to plague communities nation-wide. The SCSO recognizes this effective medical intervention as another way to help combat the opioid overdose threat to our community.""

About Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) and Overdose

Opioid emergencies, such as an accidental overdose, are a growing public health epidemic. On average, 79 people die from opioids, including prescription opioid analgesics and heroin, everyday in the United States; most occur outside of medical settings, such as in a home.[1],[2] Approximately 136,000 opioid overdose emergency department visits occur each year.[3] Many communities throughout the United States are facing a devastating heroin epidemic. Additionally, there are nearly two times the number of prescription opioid-related deaths as compared to heroin-related deaths.1 On average, 3,300 children five years old and younger are admitted to emergency departments each year due to accidental opioid exposure.[4]

Life-threatening opioid emergencies result in respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. Opioid-Induced Respiratory Depression (OIRD) is the most important serious adverse effect of opioids as it can be immediately life-threatening.[5] In addition to the risk of an opioid overdose associated with an opioid use disorder, there may be an increased risk of life-threatening OIRD even when patients take a prescribed dose of an opioid as directed. For example, taking high doses of opioids, taking an opioid in combination with other drugs (e.g., benzodiazepines) or alcohol, or if there is a history of certain medical conditions (e.g., COPD, severe asthma) places individuals at significantly higher risk for life-threatening OIRD.[6],[7],[8] Seconds count when a life-threatening OIRD event occurs. Without rapid intervention, brain injury or death can occur in as little as 4 minutes.[9] Most life-threatening OIRD emergencies occur in the home and are witnessed by family and friends who may be in the best position to intervene quickly.[10]

Naloxone is an opioid antagonist that displaces opioids from the receptors in the brain, temporarily reversing the life-threatening breathing problems that can occur during an opioid emergency.[11]

About EVZIO (EVV-zee-oh)

EVZIO (naloxone HCl injection) Auto-injector is an opioid antagonist indicated for the emergency treatment of known or suspected opioid overdose, as manifested by respiratory and/or central nervous system depression. EVZIO is intended for immediate administration as emergency therapy in settings where opioids may be present. EVZIO is not a substitute for emergency medical care. EVZIO is an intelligent Auto-injection system that provides simple, on-the-spot voice and visual guidance. EVZIO is small, easy-to-carry and easy-to-use to help patients and caregivers keep it on hand so they can take fast, confident action administering EVZIO during an opioid emergency. Results averaged across two adequate and well-controlled usability studies demonstrate more than 94% of users can correctly administer EVZIO without training, and 100% with training.[12] Each EVZIO pre-filled, single-use, hand-held Auto-injector delivers a single 0.4 mg dose of naloxone. Each EVZIO prescription comes with two Auto-injectors and a Trainer. For more information on EVZIO, including full Prescribing Information, visit www.EVZIO.com.

EVZIO IMPORTANT SAFETY INFORMATION

EVZIO is contraindicated in patients known to be hypersensitive to naloxone hydrochloride or to any of the ingredients in EVZIO.

The following warnings and precautions should be taken when administering EVZIO:

Due to the duration of action, keep the patient under continued surveillance and repeated doses of naloxone should be administered, as necessary, while awaiting emergency medical assistance.

Additional supportive and/or resuscitative measures may be helpful while awaiting emergency medical assistance.

Reversal of respiratory depression by partial agonists or mixed agonists/antagonists, such as buprenorphine and pentazocine, may be incomplete.

Use in patients who are opioid dependent may precipitate acute abstinence syndrome.

Patients with pre-existing cardiac disease or patients who have received medications with potential adverse cardiovascular effects should be monitored in an appropriate healthcare setting.

In neonates, opioid withdrawal may be life-threatening if not recognized and properly treated.

The following adverse reactions have been identified during use of naloxone hydrochloride in the postoperative setting: hypotension, hypertension, ventricular tachycardia and fibrillation, dyspnea, pulmonary edema, and cardiac arrest. Death, coma, and encephalopathy have been reported as sequelae of these events. Excessive doses of naloxone hydrochloride in postoperative patients have resulted in significant reversal of analgesia and have caused agitation.

Abrupt reversal of opioid effects in persons who were physically dependent on opioids has precipitated signs and symptoms of opioid withdrawal including: body aches, fever, sweating, runny nose, sneezing, piloerection, yawning, weakness, shivering or trembling, nervousness, restlessness or irritability, diarrhea, nausea or vomiting, abdominal cramps, increased blood pressure, and tachycardia. In the neonate, opioid withdrawal signs and symptoms also included: convulsions, excessive crying, and hyperactive reflexes.

You are encouraged to report negative side effects of prescription drugs to the FDA. Visit www.fda.gov/medwatch or call 1-800-FDA-1088. For full Prescribing Information visit http://evzio.com/pdfs/Evzio PI.PDF.

"Newswise — SAN FRANCISCO – A diet rich in vitamin C could cut risk of cataract progression by a third, suggests a study being published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. The research is also the first to show that diet and lifestyle may play a greater role than genetics in cataract development and severity.

Cataracts occur naturally with age and cloud the eye’s lens, turning it opaque. Despite the advent of modern cataract removal surgery, cataracts remain the leading cause of blindness globally.1 Researchers at King’s College London looked at whether certain nutrients from food or supplements could help prevent cataract progression. They also tried to find out how much environmental factors such as diet mattered versus genetics.

The team examined data from more than 1,000 pairs of female twins from the United Kingdom. Participants answered a food questionnaire to track the intake of vitamin C and other nutrients, including vitamins A, B, D, E, copper, manganese and zinc. To measure the progression of cataracts, digital imaging was used to check the opacity of their lenses at around age 60. They performed a follow-up measurement on 324 pairs of the twins about 10 years later.

During the baseline measurement, diets rich in vitamin C were associated with a 20 percent risk reduction for cataract. After 10 years, researchers found that women who reported consuming more vitamin C-rich foods had a 33 percent risk reduction of cataract progression.

Genetic factors accounted for 35 percent of the difference in cataract progression. Environmental factors, such as diet, accounted for 65 percent. These results make the study the first to suggest that genetic factors may be less important in progression of cataract than previously thought. How vitamin C inhibits cataract progression may have to do with its strength as an antioxidant. The fluid inside the eye is normally high in vitamin C, which helps prevents oxidation that clouds the lens. More vitamin C in the diet may increase the amount present in the fluid around the lens, providing extra protection. Researchers noted that the findings only pertain to consuming the nutrient through food and not vitamin supplements.

“The most important finding was that vitamin C intake from food seemed to protect against cataract progression,” said study author Christopher Hammond, M.D., FRCOphth, professor of ophthalmology at King’s College London. “While we cannot totally avoid developing cataracts, we may be able to delay their onset and keep them from worsening significantly by eating a diet rich in vitamin C.” “Genetic and Dietary Factors Influencing the Progression of Nuclear Cataract,” Yonova-Doing, et al.

The latest outcomes measuring the impact of CDC’s national tobacco education campaign are as strong as those achieved in its first year, and suggest that three years into the campaign, the ads were still having a significant impact. More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. The survey results are published in the March 24 release of the journal Preventing Chronic Disease.

Unlike the 2012 campaign, which aired for 12 consecutive weeks, the 2014 campaign aired in two phases, from February 3 to April 6 and from July 7 to September 7. Phase 1 of the 2014 campaign ran ads primarily from the 2012 and 2013 campaigns; Phase 2 contained new ads. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. About 80 percent of U.S. adult cigarette smokers who were surveyed reported seeing at least one television ad from Phase 2 of the 2014 campaign.

“CDC’s Tips campaign has helped at least 400,000 smokers quit smoking for good since 2012,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “Tips is also extremely cost-effective and a best buy, saving both lives and money. With a year-round campaign we could save even more lives and money.”

Tips, the first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign, features former smokers talking about their smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases cost the United States more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct health care costs and more than $156 billion in lost productivity.

“The Tips campaign is an important counter measure to the $1 million that the tobacco industry spends each hour on cigarette advertising and promotion,” said Corinne Graffunder, Dr.P.H., director of CDC’s Office on Smoking and Health. “The money spent in one year on Tips is less than the amount the tobacco industry spends on advertising and promotion in just 3 days.”

The most recent Surgeon General’s Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress, called for airing effective messages such as the Tips ads with high frequency and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, killing about 480,000 Americans each year.

For every American who dies from a smoking-related disease, about 30 more suffer at least one serious illness from smoking. And while the percentage of American adults who smoke is at the lowest level since the CDC began tracking such data, there are still an estimated 40 million adult smokers in the U.S. Surveys show about 70 percent of all smokers want to quit, and research shows quitting completely at any age has significant health benefits.

Tips ads encourage smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or to visit www.cdc.gov/tips to view the personal stories from the campaign. The website includes detailed assistance developed by the National Cancer Institute to support smokers trying to quit.

"DENVER, March 17, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A new study gives depression sufferers much hope if only they can get their doctors to look at this study. Ketamine infusion therapy, the controversial treatment for depression, has been resisted by many physicians due to concerns about short-lived benefits, risks of addiction, and the lack of large scale studies. In contrast, this retrospective study of over three years of clinical experience, shows lasting benefits for many patients, with no apparent risk of addiction. Through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by Theodore Henderson, MD, PhD, refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently. Evidence points to the regeneration of brain cells as a critical mechanism for the relief of depression, as published in peer-reviewed journal Neural Regeneration Research, February 2016 issue.

Photo - http://photos.prnewswire.com/prnh/20160316/345149

The study, ""Practical application of the neuroregenerative properties of ketamine: real world treatment experience,"" addresses key points in the controversy surrounding the use of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of depression. Its findings stand in direct contrast to warnings from the American Psychiatric Association (APA).

While controversial in academic settings, Dr. Henderson said his direct experience supports a different strategy for multiple-infusion treatment regimens and his clinical experience shows ketamine can invoke long-lasting effects often with less than six infusions.

""The wealth of clinical experience from treating hundreds of patients with ketamine has supplanted the preliminary data that emerged from the initial open-label and small double-blinded studies,"" said Dr. Henderson, who is a board certified psychiatrist, specializing in diagnosing and treating complex conditions, based in Denver, Colorado. He is also the co-founder of Neuro-Luminance Ketamine Infusion Centers.

Patients in the study completed the Quick Inventory of Depressive Symptoms (QIDS-SR), among other scales, and 80% showed persistent positive response to the ketamine infusions treatments.

What is a Ketamine Infusion?

Ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic in use since 1970's. Intravenous administration over a prolonged period of time is key to its persistent antidepressant benefit.

Depression is associated with neuron loss, reduced synapse numbers, and dearborization of dendrites. Ketamine appears to potently induce mechanisms which reverse these neuro-degenerative processes. Citing over 60 published scientific research studies, the new research article also reviews the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine invokes a robust activation of the brain's own repair mechanisms. Another conclusion Dr. Henderson highlights is ketamine infusions can relieve refractory depression symptoms persistently, perhaps for years.

""Activation of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) appears to have an important role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine. BDNF induces synaptogenesis, dendritic arborization, improved neuronal health, and neurogenesis. These processes likely underlie the persistent benefits of ketamine.""

Dr. Henderson's findings challenge the oft-held beliefs that ketamine must be given frequently to have any benefit and that ketamine has no long-lasting benefit.

Dr. Henderson stated, ""Misconceptions about ketamine abound among psychiatrists, particularly related to possible chemical dependence problems. However, the neurobiological basis of its benefit for depression has nothing to do with causing addictive risk. Our patients get better after a few infusions and from there treatments can be discontinued."" The study also challenges concerns about neurotoxicity and a recent hypothesis that patients must experience hallucinations during ketamine infusion in order to have an anti-depressant benefit.

Topline-results of the first randomised clinical trial in the world to investigate the effects of a nutritional intervention in very early AD (pre-dementia) [1]

Topline results from the European LipiDiDiet clinical trial were presented today as part of a late-breaking presentation at the Advances in Alzheimer's Therapy (AAT) congress. They showed that in people with very early AD (pre-dementia), a once-daily nutritional drink* designated a ""food for special medical purposes"" can help to reduce brain shrinkage - particularly in the hippocampal brain area, the part of the brain that helps store short-term memories for long-term retrieval. And for those who start the intervention early and consumed it regularly, it can help to conserve memory and the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. The drink contains ""Fortasyn Connect"", a specific combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients.

This is the first time a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) to carry out everyday tasks, such as paying bills, or finding your way around, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. This is important because those with very early AD (pre-dementia) currently have no approved, available pharmacological options.

The study did not find a significant benefit in broad cognitive function (the study primary endpoint). Cognitive decline over the study period was less than originally expected when it was designed ten years ago, so differences found between the two groups were too small to be statistically significant. Project coordinator Professor Tobias Hartmann, Saarland University Germany, explained that this is the most likely reason the primary endpoint was not met.

Professor Hilkka Soininen, Professor in Neurology MD, PhD from the University of Eastern Finland, who headed the clinical trial as part of the LipiDiDiet project, said: ""Today's results are extremely valuable as they bring us closer to understanding the impact of nutritional interventions on very early AD (pre-dementia) which we are now better at diagnosing but unable to treat due to a lack of approved pharmaceutical options.

The LipiDiDiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients' ability to perform everyday tasks - possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease. We look forward to the results of subsequent analyses and the six year extension study which will provide further insights"".

The clinical trial, headed by Professor Hilkka Soininen is part of a large EC project (LipiDiDiet) to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing, AD and vascular dementia. LipiDiDiet is funded by the seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission (EC) and coordinated by Professor Hartmann, Saarland University in Germany.

Fortasyn Connect was selected by a consortium of leading researchers from 19 European institutes, for this 24-month, randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre study involving 311 patients - on the basis of its results in a previous EU project (LipiDiet).

Nearly 47 million people have Alzheimer's or a related dementia for which there is currently no cure.[2] This number is expected to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050.[2]

Study details

The trial was the first to investigate the impact of Fortasyn Connect on patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) who were randomised to receive either Fortasyn Connect or an iso-caloric control drink once daily.

The primary outcome parameter was selected to assess the effect on cognitive function (a broad measure of thinking) during 24 months intake of Fortasyn Connect compared with a control product. This was a cognitive composite score consisting of the CERAD 10-word immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition, category fluency and letter digit substitution test.

Secondary outcome parameters were brain volumes (total hippocampal, whole-brain & ventricular volumes), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Neuropsychological Test Battery composite scores: episodic memory, executive function/working memory composite and a complete composite score consisting of 16 subtests, progression to (AD) dementia, blood and CSF biomarkers, tolerance and safety.

No significant difference was observed for the cognitive composite score. Predefined analyses showed significant differences between active and control study groups for hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy, and favourable effects for CDR Sum of Boxes and episodic memory (both were most pronounced in patients with high baseline cognition with regular intake). Analyses are ongoing for progression to (AD) dementia and blood and CSF biomarkers.

Tobias Hartmann, the project's coordinator, said, ""We have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia. Indeed, certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain. However translating this into an effective intervention hasn't been easy because single nutrients simply aren't powerful enough to fight a disease like Alzheimer's alone. Today's clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients, in order to increase their effect.

""This is exciting because it shows that in the absence of effective drug options, we really have found something that can help slow down some of the most distressing symptoms in very early AD (pre-dementia); especially in those who started the intervention early. Indeed those patients who have lost the least cognitive function, have the most to gain.""

Introduction to the LipiDiDiet Project

LipiDiDiet is an innovative project which was set up in 2007 to address the impact of nutritional lipids on neuronal and cognitive performance in aging, Alzheimer's disease (AD) and Vascular Dementia. Its remit is twofold - the clinical and epidemiological assessment of the value of nutritional support in people at risk of developing AD, and to conduct basic research to better understand and improve the possible therapeutic and preventive effects of nutrition in AD and Vascular Dementia.

The project's predecessor, LipiDiet, was incorporated within the 5th EU research programme in 2002. During its years of activity, preclinical and epidemiological evidence was accumulated to support the hypothesis that certain nutritional molecules could be beneficial in reducing disease progression in Alzheimer's. This stimulated further research which led to the birth of the LipiDiDiet project.

About the European LipiDiDiet Study

As part of the LipiDiDiet project, the first randomised clinical trial to investigate the effects of a medical food Fortasyn Connect (Souvenaid), in patients with very early AD (pre-dementia), has just been completed.

The trial was funded by the seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission (EC) and run by an independent consortium of 19 research partners throughout Europe. Professor Hilkka Soininen, Professor in Neurology MD, PhD from the University of Eastern Finland headed the clinical trial as part of the LipiDiDiet project. The study co-ordinator is Tobias Hartmann, Professor for Experimental Neurology at the Saarland University, Homburg, Germany.

European LipiDiDiet Study Rationale

It is well known that diet has a significant impact on cognitive function and cognitive decline. However, whilst clinical trial results on single nutrient based interventions have been largely disappointing - epidemiological studies indicate that dietary patterns (e.g. Mediterranean or healthy Nordic Diet) are more effective in maintaining cognitive function and risk reduction than single nutrients.

Extensive preclinical investigation, which took place as part the LipiDiDiet project, indicated that the nutrient combination in Fortasyn Connect has effects on multiple biological pathways that contribute to an overall neuroprotective effect.

In addition, earlier randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with the product have shown an improved memory performance in drug-naïve mild AD patients, along with a good safety profile.

"CHICAGO, March 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Chrono Therapeutics, a pioneer in digital drug therapy, today announced that clinical data for the company's smoking cessation technology showed a statistically significant reduction in nicotine cravings in a trial of adult male smokers. The data were presented today at the Society for Research on Nicotine & Tobacco's 22nd Annual Meeting.

Chrono's wearable transdermal drug delivery device times nicotine delivery to when smokers have their strongest cravings. For example, 75% of all smokers reach for their first cigarette within 30 minutes of waking up. The Chrono Solution is designed to deliver the first dose of nicotine replacement therapy (NRT) shortly before a smoker wakes up and then creates a pattern of ""peaks and troughs"" of nicotine delivery throughout the rest of the day to assure the smoker has more nicotine support when cravings are predicted to be strongest.

""In the United States, 70 percent of smokers want to quit, but quitting is extremely difficult. In fact, most people try 8 to 10 times and this includes quit attempts with standard cessation medications like nicotine patch and gum and prescription drugs like varenicline,"" said Alan Levy, Ph.D., chairman and CEO of Chrono Therapeutics. ""Gums and patches are designed to help manage cravings, but they are only 5 to 9 percent effective. Our goal is to solve this crisis of public health with an innovative, integrated smoking cessation solution, and the data we presented demonstrates that we are on the right path.""

The clinical trial was a randomized, double blinded study of 24 adult males who smoked 11 or more cigarettes per day, indicating a high level of nicotine dependence. The subjects were divided into two groups. Test group subjects had nicotine administered over a 30-hour time period via Chrono's prototype device that delivered nicotine according to Chrono's ""peaks and troughs"" profile. Control subjects had a placebo solution, with no nicotine, administered at the same intervals via the same prototype device. Across both groups, subjects showed no serious adverse events or study withdrawals due to an adverse event. Skin irritation assessment showed no signs of irritation or erythema.

Cravings were assessed via three different methods: the Questionnaire for Smoking Urges (QSU), the Mood and Physical Symptoms Scale (MPSS) and a single craving question, each of which is a validated tool to assess cravings. When compared to subjects treated with placebo, test subjects had a statistically significant and clinically meaningful reduction in cravings for all assessment methods (p=0.035; p=0.034 and p=0.016, respectively).

""Achieving statistical significance in a 24-subject trial is very striking and happens infrequently in biopharma; so these results are very encouraging,"" noted Wende Hutton, general partner at Canaan Partners and a member of Chrono's board of directors. ""Quitting smoking is one of the simplest ways to improve global public health, but as the dismal efficacy of current therapies demonstrates, it is also one of the hardest. I'm very excited to be working with a company that has the potential to solve such a serious problem.""

About Chrono Therapeutics

Effective care of the most hard-to-treat conditions requires approaches beyond simply taking medicine. Chrono's team is developing the first wearable transdermal drug delivery device that optimizes drug dosing, is embedded with sensor technology to track usage and is connected via Bluetooth to an evidence-based smartphone application that delivers real-time personalized behavioral support to keep users on track to achieve their goals. Chrono's first application is in smoking cessation, enabling smokers to overcome the world's deadliest addiction. For more information, visit www.chronothera.com.

"Newswise — The breast surgery and reconstructive team at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, NJ, is taking the lead in providing new and progressive advances in breast cancer surgery. Valley was the first hospital in northern New Jersey where an innovative technique – called pre-pectoral placement of a tissue expander -- was utilized during breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. The procedure results in diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome for patients.

The technique has the potential to be a “game-changer,” says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43.

“This variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,” notes Dr. Small. “Here at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer.” The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman’s pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months — during which the woman’s chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin — the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period.

“Over the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,” notes Dr. Small. “It is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients.”

Ms. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley’s Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. “This was a long journey,” says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. “Dr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small’s willingness to ‘look outside the box’ and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results.” Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. “It’s important to listen to each woman’s needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,” says Dr. Wilson.

The Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach. The Breast Center is designated by the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, a program of the American Cancer Society. Valley’s Breast Imaging Center has been named a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology.",0
"Newswise — DALLAS – Feb. 25, 2016 – A 59-year-old heart patient with dangerously high levels of cholesterol that could not be adequately reduced by statin drugs now has near-normal cholesterol levels, thanks to a new class of drugs that grew out of work done by UT Southwestern Medical Center researchers.

Two of these drugs, in a category known as PCSK9 inhibitors, were approved by the Food and Drug Administration last summer for use by some individuals with extremely high cholesterol levels.

“If you take the core patients who are at highest risk, it makes you appreciate how important this drug class is,” said Dr. Amit Khera, Director of the Preventive Cardiology Program and Associate Professor of Internal Medicine at UT Southwestern.

Frank Brown of Dallas, grandfather of six and the owner of Frank’s Wrecker Service in Dallas, has familial hypercholesterolemia, an inherited condition that causes high levels of cholesterol, especially low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol or “bad cholesterol.” High levels of LDL cholesterol are strongly associated with heart disease.

Mr. Brown, with a history of two heart attacks, had been aggressively treated with multiple drugs to reduce his cholesterol levels, but they remained stubbornly high.

“When I first met Mr. Brown, he had a strong family history of heart disease, he had a cholesterol level that was ridiculously high with an LDL of 384, and he was having chest pains,” said Dr. Amit Khera, who is Mr. Brown’s cardiologist.

Dr. Khera, who holds the Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Hypertension and Heart Disease at UT Southwestern, was treating Mr. Brown with three cholesterol-lowering medications: a statin, which is a class of drugs that works by blocking a substance the body needs to make cholesterol; ezetimibe, a drug that blocks absorption of cholesterol in the intestine; and colesevelam, which sequesters bile acids. Even with this trio of medicines, Mr. Brown’s LDL cholesterol level hovered around 200.

The two PCSK9 inhibitors approved by the FDA last year were developed as a result of research done by UT Southwestern geneticists Dr. Helen Hobbs and Dr. Jonathan Cohen. Using data from the Dallas Heart Study, a population-based study that gathered extensive medical data on 6,000 Dallas residents, the two researchers showed that certain mutations to the gene that codes for the protein PCSK9 lead to low levels of cholesterol in the blood.

Further,Dr. Hobbs and Dr. Cohen found a woman who had inherited not one, but two of these mutations in the PCSK9 gene – one mutation from each parent. This woman had stunningly low levels of LDL cholesterol. While anything below 100 is considered good, her LDL cholesterol level was just 14. Crucially, this woman was in good health, suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking PCSK9 would not only be effective, but also safe.

Their research led to the development by drug companies of evolocumab and alirocumab, the two approved PCSK9 inhibitors, which are delivered by monthly or semimonthly injections.

Dr. Hobbs, Director of the Eugene McDermott Center for Human Growth and Development, holds the Eugene McDermott Distinguished Chair for the Study of Human Growth and Development, the Philip O’Bryan Montgomery, Jr., M.D. Distinguished Chair in Developmental Biology, and the 1995 Dallas Heart Ball Chair in Cardiology Research. Dr. Cohen, Professor of Internal Medicine and with the McDermott Center, holds the C. Vincent Prothro Distinguished Chair in Human Nutrition Research. Mr. Brown had been part of a clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of one of the new PCSK9 inhibitors and, when the drugs were approved, Dr. Khera began working to get Mr. Brown approved by his insurance to be on the new regimen.

“In the world of cholesterol patients, most are well-controlled with statins, and they should stay on those,” said Dr. Khera. “But Mr. Brown is the perfect patient for PCSK9 inhibitors. We knew he could tolerate it because he’d been in a clinical trial, he knew how to administer the injections, and he was very high-risk. We’d exhausted the other options in trying to control his cholesterol.”

Two months after he started his biweekly injections of the new drug, Mr. Brown’s LDL cholesterol level was down to 111 – not quite normal, which is 100 or less – but an almost 50 percent reduction from the level it had been for years.

It’s a good sign for Mr. Brown, who looks forward to many more years of running his business, watching Dallas Cowboys games, and spending time with his grandchildren.

“There are many more Frank Browns out there – patients who can’t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs,” said Dr. Khera. “It’s wonderful to have this option to offer this special set of patients.” About UT Southwestern Medical CenterUT Southwestern, one of the premier academic medical centers in the nation, integrates pioneering biomedical research with exceptional clinical care and education. The institution’s faculty includes many distinguished members, including six who have been awarded Nobel Prizes since 1985.

PMS is a combination of physical and emotional symptoms linked to the menstrual cycle. PMS symptoms occur 1 to 2 weeks before a woman's period. Up to 80% of women report having some symptoms prior to menstruation. These symptoms qualify as PMS in 20% to 30% of pre-menopausal women. According to the Medical University of South Carolina, current available treatments include SSRIs and other drug treatments that treat side effects and can cost from US$60.00 - US$535.00 per month.

More than 200 different symptoms have been associated with PMS, including emotional symptoms such as: stress, anxiety, insomnia, fatigue, mood swings, emotional sensitivity and/or changes in libido. Physical symptoms can include bloating, abdominal cramps, constipation, lower back pain, acne, breast swelling, muscle pain and others.

""When the benefits of phospholipids on PMS and PMDD came to light through Lipogen's research, we immediately explored its potential,"" says David Rutenberg, CEO for Lipogen. ""Realizing the significance of this discovery, it encouraged us to further explore a product line for women's health utilizing Lipogen's proprietary phospholipid ingredients.""

The previously unrecognized PMS/PMDD benefit of PS Plus came about when 2,000 volunteers received and consumed Lipogen's PS Plus for brain health and stress management. At the end of the 2-month study, out of 220 women under the age of 40 who consumed the product regularly, 23 women (10.45%) reported that they noticed relief of premenstrual syndromes. They also reported that it helped them sleep better, experience fewer mood swings, fewer hot flashes and reduced stress.

""Based on these strong results, we improved the formulation and applied for a patent in the US market,"" explains Rutenberg. ""We also have begun an ongoing, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled clinical trial with daacro GmbH, Trier, Germany, to learn more how Lipogen's formulation can help alleviate PMS and PMDD symptoms. Our patented solution is made of natural ingredients, is GMO-free, and can save significant health costs over medication alternatives, all with no reported side-effects.""

With 25 years of specializing in natural phospholipid research, development and production, Lipogen guarantees its customers ingredient systems that are supported by the highest level of scientific data, technical quality and safety to meet the growing demand for natural cognitive health solutions.

"Newswise — Omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal obese women, according to researchers.

The protection likely comes from the fatty acids' anti-inflammatory effects, said Dr. Andrea Manni, professor and division chief of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, Penn State College of Medicine.

Obesity is a major breast cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women, and scientists believe increased inflammation is an important underlying cause in this population.

""Omega-3 fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory effect, so that's one of the reasons why we suspected it may be particularly effective in obese women,"" Manni said.

Some epidemiological data supports the idea that omega-3s protect against breast cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent. Manni suspected that data from normal-weight women obscured the results.

Normal-weight women have less inflammation than heavier women, and are therefore less likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory omega-3s, he said.

To tease apart the effects, Manni's team, working alongside researchers from Emory University and Colorado State University, looked at the influence of prescription omega-3 supplementation on breast density in different weight women. Breast density is a well-established biomarker for breast cancer risk, and may be an independent risk factor, as well.

""The higher the breast density, the more likely the woman will develop breast cancer,"" Manni said.

The study included 266 healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms. The women either received no treatment, the antiestrogen drug Raloxifene, the prescription omega-3 drug Lovaza or a combination of the two drugs.

At the conclusion of the two-year study, the researchers found that increasing levels of omega-3 in the blood were associated with reduced breast density—but only in women with a body mass index above 29, bordering on obesity.

Although Lovaza contains both of the fatty acids DHA -- 375 milligrams -- and EPA -- 465 milligrams, only DHA blood levels were associated with breast density reduction. The researchers plan to test the effect of DHA alone in obese subjects, potentially in combination with weight loss, in a future trial.

""The finding supports the idea that omega-3s, and specifically DHA, are preferentially protective in obese postmenopausal women,"" Manni said. ""This represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention.""

These findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega-3 supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women.

Manni added that, with obesity-related cancers on the rise, the findings could have implications beyond breast cancer.

The researchers also made a secondary discovery. Lovaza is an omega-3 drug FDA-approved for the treatment of severe high triglycerides at the dose of 4 milligrams daily. In the current study, the combination of Lovaza and a half recommended dose of Raloxifene at 30 milligrams, was superior to the individual treatments in reducing triglycerides and LDL -- “bad” -- cholesterol and increasing HDL -- “good” -- cholesterol.

Other investigators on this project were Narinder Sandhu and Carina Signori, Department of Medicine; Susann E. Schetter, Department of Radiology; Jason Liao and Ana Calcagnotto, Department of Public Health Sciences; John P. Richie, Bogdan Prokopczyk and Neil Trushin, Department of Pharmacology; Cynthia DuBrock, Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute; Christopher Hamilton and Laurence M. Demers, Department of Pathology; Cesar Aliaga and Karam El-Bayoumy, Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, all at Penn State Milton S. Hershey Medical Center; Terryl J. Hartman, Emory University; and John McGinley and Henry J. Thompson, Colorado State University.Susan G. Komen for the Cure and Penn State Hershey Cancer Institute funded this research. GlaxoSmith Kline and Eli Lilly supplied Lovaza and Raloxifene, respectively.

"Newswise — HAMILTON, Jan. 12, 2016 – A multi-disciplinary team of researchers has developed a new diagnostic test that can change the medical landscape by making it possible for patients to quickly determine if they are infected with an illness, using a simple paper test sensitive enough to detect markers of various illnesses using minute amounts of blood, sweat, or other biological material. The test, developed by biochemists, engineers and chemists at McMaster University, features an all-inclusive patch of reactive material, or reagent, printed on paper that changes colour to indicate the presence of a biological marker for a specific bacterium, virus, or even cancer. “It’s a very simple device that anyone can use,” says Yingfu Li, a professor of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster and one of the authors of a new paper in the German chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie. “There’s a huge need for this type of technology.” Li explains that the platform can be manufactured cheaply, and easily formulated to detect biological markers for a huge range of illnesses. Only a tiny sample of blood, sweat or other fluid is required, since the test works by detecting and amplifying the target DNA or RNA sequence in a sample. A single molecule of the target can be multiplied thousands of times, producing a visible result. Conceivably, a user could swab a doorknob or dip it in a toilet bowl to test for Ebola, for example. The test is the latest in a series of related developments to emerge from the Biointerfaces Institute, whose mission is to create useful new substances that combine biological agents and physical materials. “The new test involves printing of all required components needed to amplify a DNA or RNA target directly on paper,” says the institute’s director, John Brennan. “The user only needs to add the sample to the paper and wait a few minutes for a color to develop.” The test material is suspended in pullulan, a naturally derived polymeric sugar that is also the platform for the familiar Listerine breath strips. Pullulan allows the testing materials to remain viable for months until used. The new test, which could be commercialized quickly, the researchers say, can diagnose infections even before patients feel symptoms. During cold season, for example, patients could save trips to the doctor and exposing the public by testing themselves at home. The test can also quickly differentiate between illnesses that share similar symptoms, such as headache, fever or diarrhea, permitting a quick diagnosis and earlier treatment. Because it is portable, inexpensive and requires no other equipment, the technology – which can be printed on paper by an inkjet printer – could be used in many environments, such as homes and airports, and in remote locations. Research funding was provided by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada, Ontario Centres of Excellence and Pro-Lab Diagnostics Inc.

"WALNUT CREEK, Calif., Jan. 15, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Child screams from the pain of earache; exhausted parent ventures to drugstore in wee hours to find…nothing. ""Eardrops don't work,"" says Dr. Scott Morehouse, founder of ClearPop, ""because the Eustachian tube, where the pain occurs, is connected to the mouth, not the outer ear.""

The beleaguered parent now drags hollering kid to the doctor's office, only to find the pediatrician reluctant to prescribe antibiotics. Since 2013, the American Academy of Pediatrics endorses a wait-and-see approach, seeking to let more earaches heal on their own without antibiotics.

In light of this, Morehouse developed a lollipop with a patented shape optimized to pull congestion out of the middle ear and into the mouth. ClearPop for Rapid Earache Relief has been shelved by Raley's (CA, NV) select RiteAid locations, and is available at boutique drugstores and Amazon. Moms have flooded https://www.facebook.com/ClearPop with glowing testimonials for this simple drug-free solution that:

-doesn't require an ER or doctor visit.



-can be given along with analgesics or antibiotics.

-is increasingly used by frequent flyers to deal with ear pain that afflicts children disproportionately during air travel.

-is naturally flavored.

-is a delicious treat to a kid.



CLINICAL TESTS

Children diagnosed with Acute Otitis Media, or ear infection, consumed the xylitol and Vitamin C-based product in pediatric offices. After 20 minutes, 88.5% reported their ear pain dramatically reduced or vanished. The earache episode was totally resolved for 80%. Full study report at http://clearpop.com



EAR INFECTION AND ANTIBIOTICS

Ear infections are the Number One reason kids aged 5 and under receive oral antibiotics. Due to increasing concern about antibiotic overuse and its links to obesity, celiac disease, and Superbugs, the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommends against the use of antibiotics to treat routine ear infections in children over 2.

ABOUT CLEARPOP

ClearPop for Rapid Earache Relief represents a simple, safe, pediatrician recommended, clinically effective and fun way to treat earaches. ClearPop is made by Try This First, Inc. a physician-funded ""small pharma"" organization aimed at reducing the estimated 30 million antibiotics prescriptions written to children yearly for ear infection.

"Newswise — RESEARCH TRIANGLE PARK, NC— Major depressive disorder affects more than 32 million Americans, and their first stop for treatment is often their primary care provider. A recent evidence review of several alternatives to medication found that using cognitive behavioral therapy as the first treatment for depression can be equally effective as using a second generation antidepressant.

The research from the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center was published today in the British Medical Journal. The authors focused specifically on comparing second generation antidepressants, such as Wellbutrin, Lexapro and Prozac with cognitive behavioral therapy, which includes several in-person or phone sessions with a therapist to examine how actions and thoughts can impact depression. Second-generation antidepressants refers to newer antidepressants introduced primarily in the 1980s and 1990s.

""Major depressive disorder is a disabling and prevalent form of depression, experienced by more than 16 percent of U.S. adults during their lifetime,"" said Arlene Bierman, M.D., Director, Center for Evidence and Practice Improvement, at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, which funded the study. ""Most patients will be prescribed antidepressants. However, the evidence shows that cognitive behavioral therapy can be just as effective, providing important information for patients and their physicians to consider when choosing among available treatment options.""

After conducting a full review of the scientific literature available, the researchers examined 11 randomized controlled trials with 1,511 patients that compared a second generation antidepressant with cognitive behavioral therapy. They found that symptom improvement and rate of remission were similar between the two options, whether used alone or in combination with each other.

""Primary care clinicians and their patients may not automatically consider alternatives when discussing treatment,"" said Halle Amick, research associate at the RTI International-University of Chapel Hill Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author. ""Our findings indicate that both options should be considered effective initial treatment strategies.""

Side effects from antidepressants can include constipation, diarrhea and dizziness. Patients also sometimes express concerns about becoming addicted to medications and therefore prefer psychotherapy. However, psychotherapy can be time-consuming and may be substantially more expensive, depending on the patient's insurance benefits.

""Given comparable effectiveness, doctors need to discuss advantages and disadvantages of both treatment options with their patients. Such shared and informed decision making might enhance treatment adherence which is one of the main challenges of treating major depressive disorder,"" said Gerald Gartlehner, M.D., associate director of the RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center, who was the principal investigator of the evidence review, which was also published today by AHRQ.

A journal article describing all the review findings will be published in the Annals of Internal Medicine in January.

""Bringing psychotherapy into discussions of treatment may also enhance coordination of care between primary care and mental health care providers in addition to addressing the issue of patient-centered care,"" Amick said. ""If primary care providers discuss psychotherapy with their patients as a valid treatment option, it may empower patients to voice their preferences and truly participate in medical decision-making and encourage them to adopt and adhere to effective treatment of their depression.""

RTI-UNC Evidence-based Practice Center is a collaboration between RTI and the five health professions schools and the Cecil G. Sheps Center for Health Services Research at UNC. It is funded by the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.

"CHICAGO, Dec. 2, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- An analysis of clinical data from over 200 patients treated by Dr. Michael Stehling found that a new procedure that uses MR and ultrasound to guide treatment to the precise tumor location allows for faster recovery times and lower side effects in all stages of prostate cancer. Data found that the most common side effects are either eliminated or greatly reduced using image guided treatment. The study which was conducted at the Prostata Center of Offenbach, Germany (www.prostate-center.org) will be presented today at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America (RSNA).

""The patients we have treated at The Prostata Center have had their cancers destroyed without the need for surgery, with a low incidence of side effects and in most cases have been back on their feet the next day,"" said Dr. Michael K. Stehling, an internationally recognized expert on image guided tumor ablation treatments and primary author of the study. ""The data from this study confirms what we see every day, we have a very attractive approach for patients who are concerned about quality of life challenges and are considering options for the treatment of localized and late stage prostate cancer,"" he said.

Dr. Stehling has treated the most prostate cancer patients in the world using this image guided treatment, while generating the best therapeutic results. At the Prostata-Center which he founded in 2010, Stehling has treated hundreds of patients at every grade and stage of prostate cancer, and helped to advance the use of image guided treatment technologies. Dr. Stehling is a German Professor of Radiology, a former Associate Professor at Boston University and served as Research Assistant to Sir Peter Mansfield, Prof of Physics and Nobel Prize winner in Medicine in 2003 (for discoveries concerning magnetic resonance imaging).

Unlike other treatment procedures for prostate cancer therapy, image guided or irreversible electroporation (IRE) only destroys cells; vital tissue structures are not affected, making IRE the first tissue-selective form of therapy. IRE uses strong electric fields that cause cells to die without exposing the tissue to radiation or heat. IRE is precision guided and reliably destroys cells within the treatment field, but important anatomical structures in and around the prostate such as nerves, the intestinal wall, the sphincter, veins and arteries are spared. Potential issues with erection and bladder control and other side effects are reduced while healing time is minimal, making it an ideal method for focal prostate cancer therapy and for men concerned about quality of life challenges.

For the study, Dr. Stehling and his team of researchers evaluated data from 265 patients with primary (stages T1-T4) and recurrent PCa after surgery, radiation therapy and HIFU. Initial tumor control was achieved in all patients, and during the follow-up period of up to 4 years, the recurrence rates were 0/55 (Gleason <7), 3/117 (Gleason 7) and 10/67 (Gleason >7). There were no IRE-related complications and toxicity was extremely low: 27 patients reported a transient reduction of erectile function (EF) (resolved after 6-8m), 15 a permanent reduction and 2 a permanent loss of EF.

Throughout the study, there were no cases of IRE-related incontinence, even when the lower urinary sphincter was included in the treatment field. Incontinence is one of the most common adverse side effects of current treatments for localized prostate cancer and can have a substantial impact on the quality of life. The IRE treatment also had very low toxicity on the rectum and bladder, even in cases of advanced cancer infiltrating these structures in patients who were not candidates for surgery or radiation therapy anymore.

""Treating prostate cancer with minimal pain and minimal risk of impotence and incontinence, even in patients with advanced and recurrent cancer, with a one-time, one-day treatment, until recently, was unthinkable,"" Dr. Stehling said. ""The cutting edge technology of IRE makes this a reality.""

"TUCSON, Ariz., Nov. 18, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- In a clinical trial conducted for HSRx Group, an Arizona-based biopharmaceutical company, the OTC acne treatment product HSRx 2121 significantly outperformed a market-leading product in reducing acne count, redness and severity.

The single-site, randomized, double-blind, placebo controlled comparative clinical study involved 90 subjects and calibrated results at 1, 2, 3, 7, 14, 28 and 42 days. The trial was conducted by Moore Clinical Research, Inc., an independent FDA-compliant contract research organization with considerable experience in acne product testing.

""For consumers desiring immediate results, HSRx 2121 is the clear choice,"" said Thomas Sullivan, Jr., Chief Executive Officer of HSRx Group. After 24 hours treatment, the percentage of subjects with reduced acne count was 64% greater for those using HSRx 2121 than for subjects using the competing product. At 24 hours, the percentage reduction in total acne count with HSRx 2121 was 20 times greater than it was for subjects using the competing product. ""Acne sufferers' number one priority is getting rid of inflammatory lesions – pimples – fast,"" Sullivan said. ""We demonstrated that with HSRx 2121.""

After 48 hours, the percentage of subjects with unsightly acne-associated redness was reduced nearly three times as much with HSRx 2121 as with the competing product.

At seven days, the percentage of subjects exhibiting reduced severity was six times greater for those using HSRx 2121, compared to those using the competing product. The HSRx product demonstrated superior treatment performance throughout the entire clinical study. ""That makes for a powerful marketing advantage,"" Sullivan said.

Acne treatment represents a vast global market estimated at $3-4 billion annually, with significant expansion expected among surging middle class populations in China and India. ""Acne is a universal plague,"" said Frank Parise, HSRx Group Chief Financial Officer, citing a recent NASA warning that even the International Space Station harbors germs that can cause the disease. ""Acne is among the 10 most prevalent human infectious diseases and recent studies show it has a significant long-term psychological impact on many of the 80+% of teenagers and young adults who suffer from it,"" he added.

""Our acne treatment product has enormous commercial potential, evidenced by the significant licensee interest it has attracted. As with each of our next generation OTC drug products, we intend to license HSRx 2121 to a leading marketing entity that has the resources and expertise to maximize sales, here and abroad,"" Parise said.

"Newswise — LEAWOOD, KS — Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of disability in adults in the United States and knee OA specifically is ranked within the top 10 non-communicable diseases for global disability-adjusted life years. The lifetime risk of suffering symptomatic knee OA is estimated to be 44.7% and approximately 1 in 11 of the US population is diagnosed with symptomatic knee OA by age 60. With this knowledge, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) has released a new scientific statement that provides guidance for physicians and healthcare professionals who provide care for those patients with knee osteoarthritis.

There is a general consensus that the initial management of knee OA treatment should include weight loss and strengthening exercises. However, certain aspects of treatment for knee OA are controversial. In light of these issues, the AMSSM convened an expert writing group of four sports medicine physicians to review the latest data and provide recommendations for the sports medicine community.

“We do not treat groups of people we treat individuals,” said Dr. Thomas Trojian, Lead Author and Past AMSSM Board of Director. “It is important to look at how a person responds to a medication. Does the person improve if given an injection of viscosupplementation more likely than placebo or intra-articular steroid? Using a network meta-analysis we are able to compare the multiple studies done on viscosupplementation and have found that people are more likely to show clinical improvement with viscosupplementation over placebo (saline) and intra-articular steroids. This is different than studies recently published that say the average response differs.” The full report, published ahead of print in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicince (CJSM) and will appear in the (British Journal of Sports Medicine) BJSM, entitled, AMSSM Scientific Statement Concerning Viscosupplementation Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis Importance for Individual Patient Outcomes, includes the following notable AMSSM recommendations and one suggestion:

• AMSSM RECOMMENDS viscosupplementation injections for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade II-III knee osteoarthritis in those patients above the age of 60 based on HIGH quality evidence demonstrating benefit using OMERACT-OARSI Responder Rating but the evidence should be downgraded due to indirectness for those under 60 years of age.• AMSSM SUGGESTS viscosupplementation injections for knee osteoarthritis for those under the age of 60 based on MODERATE quality evidence due to response of treatment in those over 60.• AMSSM RECOMMENDS clinicians and researchers collect OMERACT-OARSI responder data to track individual response to the viscosupplementation.

The full paper will be published in print in the January 2016 issues of CJSM and BJSM.

"Newswise — Anew gastric balloon that can be swallowed like a pill and then filledwhile in the stomach, helped patients lose more than 37 percent oftheir excess weight over four months, according to new researchpresented here at ObesityWeek 2015, the largest international eventfocused on the basic science, clinical application and prevention andtreatment of obesity. The weeklong conference is hosted by the

AmericanSociety for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery (ASMBS) and The ObesitySociety (TOS).

AllurionTechnologies, the manufacturer of the device called Elipse, whichis not yet commercially available, is studyingwhat it says is the “first procedureless gastric balloon” inpatients with a body mass index (BMI) of 27 or more.

Thetreatment involves patients swallowing a capsule that quicklydissolves in the stomach to reveal a deflated gastric balloon inside.With a thin catheter attached to the device, but long enough toremain outside the patient’s mouth, a physician fills the balloonwith fluid (550 mL) to about the size of a grapefruit. The catheteris then removed, while the balloon remains in the stomach for fourmonths. At that point, a valve designed to open on its own, allowsthe balloon to empty and be excreted naturally from the body,eliminating the need for endoscopy or another procedure.

“ Likeother gastric balloons, the mechanism of action of Elipse is likelymultifactorial and includes increased satiety from the reduction ofavailable space in the stomach, delayed gastric emptying, and changesin hormones that control hunger and appetite,” saidRam Chuttani, MD*, study co-author and director of Endoscopy andchief, Interventional Gastroenterology at Beth Israel DeaconessMedical Center in Boston. “Our findings demonstrate that Elipseprovides individuals and their caregivers with a safe, effective, andnon-invasive weight loss intervention that does not require surgery,endoscopy, or anesthesia.”

Researcherspresented interim results for the first 34 patients of a multi-centerstudy that showed individuals lost an average of 22 pounds after fourmonths or 37 percent of their excess weight. Patients also sawimprovements in triglycerides and hemoglobin A1c (HgbA1c) levels,risk factors for heart disease and diabetes. Similar to othergastric balloons, the most common adverse events reported were nauseaand vomiting.

NinhT. Nguyen, MD, immediate pastpresident of the ASMBS and vice-chair, UC Irvine Department ofSurgery and chief of gastrointestinal surgery, who was not involvedin the study said the device is not a permanent solution to weightloss, but has the potential to help those individuals who areoverweight or have obesity and are not candidates for bariatricsurgery.

“ Newtreatment options are being studied and approved for the treatment ofobesity, which is good news for our patients and the healthcareprofessionals involved in their treatment,” said Dr. Nguyen, whowas not involved in the study. “For many struggling with theirweight, procedureless gastric balloon devices may serve as atreatment option that bridges the gap between weight-loss drugs andsurgery.”

TheU.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) this year alone approved theOrberaIntragastric Balloon from Apollo Endosurgery and theReShapeIntegrated Dual Balloon System from ReShape Medical. Bothdevices are indicated for adults with BMIs between 30 and 40 whocould not lose weight through diet and exercise alone. The FDA also approved threeweight-loss drugs since 2012.

AboutObesity and Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery

Accordingto the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), more than 78million adults were obese in 2011–2012. i The ASMBS estimates about 24 million people have severe or morbidobesity. Individuals with a BMI greater than 30 have a 50 to 100percent increased risk of premature death compared to healthy weightindividuals as well as an increased risk of developing more than 40obesity-related diseases and conditions including type 2 diabetes,heart disease and cancer. ii , iii

Metabolic/bariatricsurgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lastingtreatment for morbid obesity and many related conditions and resultsin significant weight loss. The Agency for Healthcare Research andQuality (AHRQ) reported significant improvements in the safety ofmetabolic/bariatric surgery due in large part to improvedlaparoscopic techniques. iv The risk of death is about 0.1 percent v and the overall likelihood of major complications is about 4percent. vi

"EVANSTON, Ill., Nov. 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- People looking to fend off cold and flu as the winter months arrive should speak to a massage therapist about prevention strategies. Regular massages have been shown to make the immune system stronger, according to studies.

""Researchers working with patients with compromised immune systems have found massage therapy can improve how the immune system functions,"" said Jeff Smoot, President of the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA). ""Those same benefits translate to people seeking to fight off the common cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses.""

Massage therapy increases the activity level of the body's white blood cells that work to combat viruses. According to research from Cedars-Sinai, participants in a Swedish massage group experienced significant changes in lymphocytes, which play a large role in defending the body from disease.i A lymphocyte is one of the three subtypes of white blood cells in the immune system.

In a controlled study composed of HIV-positive adolescents, participants who received massage therapy showed enhanced immune function by the end of the 12-week study. The immune changes included increased white blood cells knowns as natural killer (NK) cells, which provide rapid responses to viral-infected cells.ii

An additional randomized study found women with stage 1 and 2 breast cancer may benefit from massage therapy for enhancing dopamine and serotonin while also increasing NK cell number and lymphocytes. Immediate massage benefits included reduced anxiety while the long-term impact increased serotonin values, natural killer cell numbers and lymphocytes,iii which work to strengthen the immune system and cognitive function during sickness.

"Brain stimulation limits calories consumed in adults with obesity

Credit: Dr. Marci Gluck

What

A National Institutes of Health study found that non-invasive brain stimulation decreased calorie consumption and increased weight loss in adults who are obese. The findings suggest a possible intervention for obesity, when combined with healthy eating and exercise. Results were published in Obesity concurrent with a presentation at the 2015 Obesity Society meeting.

Led by scientists at the Phoenix Epidemiology and Clinical Research Branch, part of NIH’s National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases (NIDDK), the team studied a total of nine men and women with obesity who resided in the Branch’s metabolic ward on two separate visits, each for eight days. On each visit, the participants ate a weight-maintaining diet for five days. Then for three days, they unknowingly received either active or sham (fake) transcranial direct current stimulation, or tDCS. Participants then ate and drank as much as they wanted from computerized vending machines. Applied to the scalp, the active tDCS targeted the brain region controlling behavior and reward.

The four people who got the sham stimulation during both visits consumed the same number of calories from the vending machines on each visit and did not lose weight. But the five people who got inactive stimulation on the first visit, and active tDCS at the brain target on the second visit, consumed an average of 700 fewer calories and lost an average of 0.8 pounds on the second visit.

Next, the researchers will compare a group getting only active tDCS with a separate group getting only sham stimulation. More study is needed to confirm the safety and effectiveness of tDCS for weight loss.

"MEMPHIS, Tenn., Oct. 26, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Imagine. A nick of the skin, a flash of cold and 25 minutes on an exam table. For thousands of women, this may soon replace surgery as a treatment for breast cancer.

Cryoablation, using extreme cold to destroy diseased cells, is potentially the first ever procedure to treat breast cancer tumors without the trauma of surgery. Following numerous limited studies, a growing number of women are now being treated with the technique as part of a groundbreaking clinical trial involving leading breast cancer specialists across the country. Utilizing IceCure Medical's innovative IceSense3™ cryoablation system, the multi-center trial is examining cryoablation of certain types of breast cancer. Potentially, it will usher in a new and gentler pathway for the treatment of a disease that affects one in every eight women annually.

The benefits of cryoablation over traditional breast cancer surgery are significant. The procedure is typically performed in a physician's office under ultrasound guidance in less than 30 minutes. It involves a small incision and placement of an IceSense3™ nitrogen-cooled probe into the center of a tumor to freeze it from the inside out. The diseased cells then crack open and die. Eventually they are absorbed by the immune system and new cells take their place.

By contrast, surgical cancer removal often means several hours in the operating room, complications of general anesthesia and weeks or months of recovery. Surgery also typically involves significant breast tissue damage and disfigurement due to large incisions and removal of sizable breast mass.

Cryoablation, however, precisely targets the tumor site and involves insertion of only a slim probe. Therefore, it boasts fast recovery time, significantly improved cosmetic results and greater patient comfort overall. In fact, most women are able to resume normal activities almost immediately following treatment. They experience minimal scarring and excellent cosmetic results.

Physicians participating in the trial report that patients feel minimal discomfort and can watch the procedure on the ultrasound screen. Most are extremely relieved to avoid painful, disfiguring surgery and long recovery times.

""For women with certain types of breast cancer, cryoablation is showing promise as an alternative to surgery, particularly for patients over age 65,"" says Susan K. Boolbol, MD, Chief of the Appel-Venet Comprehensive Breast Service, Mount Sinai Beth Israel, who is participating in the trial. ""For older patients the risks associated with invasive procedures and general anesthesia as well as the discomfort of long recoveries also makes this procedure particularly desirable. As our understanding of tumor biology grows, the ability to offer treatment options other than surgery is important.""

""There is growing awareness treatment should be based on individual tumor biology. We are excited to be participating in this trial where some breast cancer patients can be treated without surgery,"" adds Richard Fine, MD, The West Comprehensive Breast Center, Memphis, TN, another surgeon active in the cryoablation trial. ""Over the next 15 years, women 65 and older will make up one of the fastest growing populations diagnosed with breast cancer. We are confident that the ICE3 trial can prove certain women can be successfully treated less aggressively than in the past. The option of a non-surgical treatment has significant benefits for patients and the overall health care system.""

Cryoablation is well-established in the treatment of liver, kidney, prostate and other cancers. Its effectiveness in breast cancer has been proven in a number of smaller studies, including a recent American College of Surgeons Oncology Group (ACOSOG) trial and extensive long-term ongoing, unpublished studies in Japan. The ICE3 trial, which began patient enrollment in October 2014, will significantly expand data on the technique as a treatment for breast cancer. Patents will be followed for five years to ensure they remain cancer free.

Developed by IceCure Medical (Caesarea, Israel/Memphis, TN), specifically for breast applications, the IceSense3 Cryoablation System™, has a long history of successful treatment of benign breast fibroadenomas. The ongoing refinement of the technology makes treatment more precise and extremely reliable. The IceSense3™ device delivers a stable cycle of extremely cold temperatures and relies on a maneuverable, disposable probe and compact high tech console. For the first time, these advances make precise targeting of tumors extremely reliable.

The ICE3 trial is recruiting and following women aged 65 years and older diagnosed with certain tumor sub-types and measuring less than 1.5 centimeters in diameter. Developed by a diverse, esteemed scientific advisory board, the trial is underway at 20 carefully selected sites throughout the United States. As a market leader in cryoablation treatment of breast disease, IceCure will utilize its resources to provide clinical and technological support to sites in the cancer trial.

"Share Fast Facts CT scans outperform stress tests in spotting clogged arteries. - Click to Tweet

CT angiograms detect blockages in nine out of 10 people. - Click to Tweet

Tests can miss four out of 10 patients with clogged heart vessels. - Click to Tweet

Results of a head-to-head comparison study led by Johns Hopkins researchers show that noninvasive CT scans of the heart’s vessels are far better at spotting clogged arteries that can trigger a heart attack than the commonly prescribed exercise stress that most patients with chest pain undergo.

A report on the findings comparing CT angiograms and stress tests, published online Oct. 14 in the journal Circulation: Cardiovascular Imaging, show the scans correctly identified blockages in nine out of 10 people, while stress tests picked up blockages in six out of 10.

What renders the results of the new study particularly powerful, researchers say, is that each patient underwent all three tests for providing a direct, head-to-head comparison of their ability to accurately spot blockages.

“No tests is 100 percent accurate 100 percent of the time, but our findings indicate CT angiograms get pretty close to that coveted threshold,” says lead investigator Armin Zadeh, M.D., Ph.D., associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. “We hope our findings will settle any residual uncertainty about the effectiveness of these two common noninvasive heart tests.”

The researchers note that the gold standard for detecting blocked arteries remains invasive cardiac angiography, a test using dye and X-rays that requires a catheter to be threaded into the heart’s vessels. But cardiologists have long relied on so-called stress testing as a simpler, cheaper “gatekeeper” procedure to identify people more likely to benefit from the riskier, more invasive and more costly catheterizations.

CT angiograms have recently emerged as yet another non-invasive alternative. A handful of studies, Zadeh says, have suggested CT angiographies may be superior, but uncertainty has persisted due the small number of people involved in these analyses, and stress tests have remained the more popular choice among clinicians.

Results of the new study, the research team says, should help settle lingering doubts among physicians and the nearly 15 million Americans who seek medical attention each year for symptoms that signal a clogged artery, including chest pain, shortness of breath and extreme fatigue.

In CT angiography, clinicians use dye injected into the circulation to visualize blockages inside the arteries. When the dye reaches impenetrable or narrowed passages clogged by fatty buildups or clots, the scan shows a blockage. The so-called nuclear exercise stress tests also use dye and CT scans but instead of directly visualizing the interior of the arteries, they measure blood flow to the heart muscle immediately after a patient walks on a treadmill. Reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is a signal that a narrowed or blocked artery is not supplying the muscle with enough blood. Although exercise stress testing is generally safe for most people, it can rarely trigger an abnormal heart rhythm or even an actual heart attack in people with seriously clogged arteries.

Researchers emphasize that both nuclear stress tests and CT angiograms expose patients to radiation. While many newer CT scans deliver substantially lower doses of radiation than the scans used in nuclear stress tests, the dose and protocols can vary widely from hospital to hospital, researchers say. CT angiograms and nuclear stress tests carry similar price tags —between $750 and $1,200. Researchers say the total tab stemming from either test, including downstream costs related to additional testing due to unclear or unrelated findings, remains unclear and should be an important consideration in crafting any new testing recommendations.

For the current study, 391 patients, ages 45 to 85, seen at 16 hospitals in eight countries, underwent noninvasive CT angiograms, followed by traditional, catheter-based coronary angiographies. Within two months, each patient also underwent an exercise stress test. All patients had symptoms suggestive of heart disease, but not all had a previous diagnosis of the condition.

Overall, non-invasive CT angiograms accurately detected or ruled out artery blockages in 91 percent of patients, compared with 69 percent for stress testing. When researchers analyzed test performance in a subgroup of 111 patients with very high-risk disease as identified on traditional angiography, the diagnostic accuracy of CT angiograms went up to 96 percent, compared with 80 percent for stress testing. In other words, researchers report, stress tests missed two out of every 10 patients with severe disease, marked by multiple blockages.

Current guidelines from the American Heart Association and the American College Cardiology call for a stress tests in all patients who show signs of coronary artery disease to confirm the diagnosis and define the severity of the blockage. CT angiograms are generally reserved only for patients with borderline stress test results. But given its much higher accuracy, the researchers say, CT angiography may be a better first-line test in people with symptoms suggestive of a blocked artery.

"WASHINGTON, Sept. 29, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- The American College of Radiology (ACR), Society of Breast Imaging (SBI) and major medical organizations experienced in breast cancer care continue to recommend that women start getting annual mammograms at age 40. This approach saves many more lives than screening started at a later age or with less frequent exams. To mark National Breast Cancer Awareness Month, women are encouraged to ask their health care providers about scheduling an annual mammogram.

""All women age 40 and over can benefit from annual mammography. Risk-based screening is a poor approach. Seventy-five percent of women diagnosed with breast cancer have no family history or other factors that place them at high risk for the disease. I encourage women to speak with their providers about mammography benefits and limitations and create a schedule to get their annual mammograms,"" said Debra Monticciolo, MD, FACR, chair of the American College of Radiology Breast Imaging Commission.

Breast cancer remains the second leading cause of deaths among women in the United States. In 2015, according to the National Cancer Institute, 231,840 women will be diagnosed with the disease and 40,290 will die from it. Deaths are highest among women who are not screened regularly and have their cancers found at later stage.

""Mammography screening is not perfect but has been shown to markedly reduce the number of women each year who die from breast cancer,"" said Elizabeth Morris, MD, FACR, president of the Society of Breast Imaging. ""The decision whether or not to get a mammogram remains with women. We want them to know that mammography can detect cancer early — when it's most treatable and can be treated less invasively — which not only saves lives but helps preserve quality of life.""

The ACR and SBI believe women 40 and older should have access to mammograms and that Medicare and private insurers should be required to cover them for these exams.

"Researchers analyzed 259 men with prostate cancer. Among the group of participants, 482 tumor, benign and germline samples were looked at. The researchers analyzed the samples and looked for genetic differences that made it so the researchers could categorize the study participants into groups regarding targeted treatments specific to their prostate cancer.

What they found was more than minimal differences among the tumors. They concluded that five different types of prostate cancer were found based on 100 genes. These genes demonstrated the risk of the disease progression, which was more accurate than the currently used Gleason score test and PSA test.

Prior research had shown six of the genes were linked to prostate cancer, however researchers noted in the published study that it turns out the other 94 genes had not been associated with prostate cancer until now.

""If five types of the disease exist, how does this change popular medical opinion on prostate cancer screening? This may mean that each type of the disease needs its own approach to screening, diagnosis, treatment and even recurrence,"" noted Dr. Samadi.

While the findings need further research, larger clinical trials could give better information on individualized treatment for each prostate cancer type. This could lead to a better quality of life and more effective treatment based on which prostate cancer a man is diagnosed with.

Prostate Cancer Key Statistics:

Prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death among men.

Other than skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men.

About 1 in 7 men will get prostate cancer in their lifetime.

Prostate cancer mainly occurs in older men; about 6 in 10 cases are diagnosed in men aged 65 or older. It is much rarer for men younger than 40 years old to develop prostate cancer.

The average age of diagnosis is about 66 years old.

In 2015, it is estimated that there will be more than 27,500 deaths from prostate cancer.

The researchers said the analysis in their study is better at forecasting how prostate cancer will advance compared to the current diagnostic tests being used for prostate cancer such as the prostate specific antigen test and the Gleason score.

""These findings could lead to more optimized diagnostic testing on all aspects of the prostate cancer diagnosis process and brings full circle the coming approach to cancer being an individual disease based very much on the patient's individual genetic profile,"" said Dr. Samadi.

"Tell-tale biomarker detects early breast cancer in NIH-funded study

MRI can detect the earliest signs of breast cancer recurrence and fast-growing tumors.

Researchers have shown that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) can detect the earliest signs of breast cancer recurrence and fast-growing tumors. Their approach detects micrometastases, breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body. The approach may offer an improved way to detect early recurrence of breast cancer in women and men. The work was completed at Case Western Reserve University (CWRU), Cleveland and was funded by the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering (NIBIB), part of the National Institutes of Health.

“MRI has a wide array of diagnostic applications and shows promise in breast cancer detection and treatment monitoring,” said Richard Conroy, Ph.D., director of NIBIB Division of Applied Science and Technology. “The technique used by researchers in this study enables very early detection of metastatic spread, which would allow adaptation of treatment more quickly and hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future.”

The study, published online in the Aug. 12, 2015, issue of Nature Communications, was led by Zheng-Rong Lu, Ph.D., CWRU M. Frank Rudy and Margaret Domiter Rudy Professor of biomedical engineering and an expert in molecular imaging for cancer and other diseases.

“We showed with this technique that we can detect very tiny tumors of just a few hundred cells,” Lu said, adding that the study pushed imaging boundaries, revealing smaller cancers than can be detected with current clinical imaging modalities. “Our imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low-risk tumors. These are two things that potentially can make a big impact on clinical practice and also management of cancer.”

One-third of patients diagnosed with breast cancer eventually develop metastases in distant organs, with an increased risk of death. Breast cancer has a high rate of metastasis to bone, lung, liver, lymph nodes, and the brain. Since small, early-stage cancers are the most responsive to drug treatments, screening is an important aspect of follow-up care for breast cancer patients, and early detection is critical in tailoring appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions. While multiple imaging techniques, including MRI, are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management, they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth.

The earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases. As the name implies, they are often too small to be detected with standard screening. Dr. Lu’s team used a biochemical approach combined with MRI to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases. To detect micrometastases, Lu and his team used MRI imaging — which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images – and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution.

The contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein, or peptide, tagged with a minuscule magnet. They chose the peptide — a chain of just five amino acids — for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells, called fibrin-fibronectin complexes. More importantly, the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cell’s transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth, migration and differentiation. Fibronectin is associated with high-risk breast cancer with poor prognosis.

The researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors. Metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the MRI process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein.

“The primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis,” Lu said. “By also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide, the biomarker is enhanced, generating enough signal for MRI detection of small, high-risk cancer and micrometastases.”

The researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells. After a two-week waiting period, the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed MRI. The MRI imaging detected metastatic tumors, including micrometastases, in lung, liver, lymph node, adrenal gland, bone, and brains of the mice.

Analysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrin-fibronectin complexes, producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue. Using a microscopic imaging approach, called cryo-imaging, and MRI, the researchers verified that the MRI technique could detect micrometastases, even observing bone micrometastases that were less than 0.5mm — the diameter of a very fine pencil lead.

Prior to their study with this contrast agent, Lu’s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging, which is essential for safe clinical use. Their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues. Therefore, they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use.

“The recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important,” said Lu, adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection. “We think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high-risk cancers in the clinic. It could also become useful as a non-invasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress.”

The team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years. They will then pursue human trials with this approach.

"Newswise — Stony Brook, NY – Embargoed for August 4 @ 5:00 PM EST, 2015 – Sleeping in the lateral, or side position, as compared to sleeping on one’s back or stomach, may more effectively remove brain waste and prove to be an important practice to help reduce the chances of developing Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s and other neurological diseases, according to researchers at Stony Brook University.

By using dynamic contrast magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to image the brain’s glymphatic pathway, a complex system that clears wastes and other harmful chemical solutes from the brain, Stony Brook University researchers Hedok Lee, PhD, Helene Benveniste, MD, PhD, and colleagues, discovered that a lateral sleeping position is the best position to most efficiently remove waste from the brain. In humans and many animals the lateral sleeping position is the most common one. The buildup of brain waste chemicals may contribute to the development of Alzheimer’s disease and other neurological conditions. Their finding is published in the Journal of Neuroscience.

Dr. Benveniste, Principal Investigator and a Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook University School of Medicine, has used dynamic contrast MRI for several years to examine the glymphatic pathway in rodent models. The method enables researchers to identify and define the glymphatic pathway, where cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) filters through the brain and exchanges with interstitial fluid (ISF) to clear waste, similar to the way the body’s lymphatic system clears waste from organs. It is during sleep that the glymphatic pathway is most efficient. Brain waste includes amyloid β (amyloid) and tau proteins, chemicals that negatively affect brain processes if they build up.

In the paper, “The Effect of Body Posture on Brain Glymphatic Transport,” Dr. Benveniste and colleagues used a dynamic contrast MRI method along with kinetic modeling to quantify the CSF-ISF exchange rates in anesthetized rodents’ brains in three positions – lateral (side), prone (down), and supine (up).

“The analysis showed us consistently that glymphatic transport was most efficient in the lateral position when compared to the supine or prone positions,” said Dr. Benveniste. “Because of this finding, we propose that the body posture and sleep quality should be considered when standardizing future diagnostic imaging procedures to assess CSF-ISF transport in humans and therefore the assessment of the clearance of damaging brain proteins that may contribute to or cause brain diseases.”

Dr. Benveniste and first-author Dr. Hedok Lee, Assistant Professor in the Departments of Anesthesiology and Radiology at Stony Brook developed the safe posture positions for the experiments. Their colleagues at the University of Rochester, including Lulu Xie, Rashid Deane and Maiken Nedergaard, PhD, used fluorescence microscopy and radioactive tracers to validate the MRI data and to assess the influence of body posture on the clearance of amyloid from the brains.

“It is interesting that the lateral sleep position is already the most popular in human and most animals – even in the wild – and it appears that we have adapted the lateral sleep position to most efficiently clear our brain of the metabolic waste products that built up while we are awake,” says Dr. Nedergaard. “The study therefore adds further support to the concept that sleep subserves a distinct biological function of sleep and that is to ‘clean up’ the mess that accumulates while we are awake. Many types of dementia are linked to sleep disturbances, including difficulties in falling asleep. It is increasing acknowledged that these sleep disturbances may accelerate memory loss in Alzheimer’s disease. Our findng brings new insight into this topic by showing it is also important what position you sleep in,” she explained.

Dr. Benveniste cautioned that while the research team speculates that the human glymphatic pathway will clear brain waste most efficiency when sleeping in the lateral position as compared to other positions, testing with MRI or other imaging methods in humans are a necessary first step.

Other co-authors on the paper include: Lulu Xie, Hongyi Kang, and Rashid Deane of the Center for Translational Neuromedicine, University of Rochester; Jean Logan of the Department of Radiology, New York University Langone Medical Center; and Tian Feng of the Department of Applied Mathematics and Statistics, Stony Brook University.

"Newswise — Chicago – Chronic back and leg pain sufferers in search of better pain relief options may have a new choice. According to a study published in the Online First edition of Anesthesiology, the official medical journal of the American Society of Anesthesiologists® (ASA®), patients who received a novel high frequency form of spinal cord stimulation (SCS) therapy experienced significantly greater, long-term relief for both chronic back and leg pain, when compared to a traditional low frequency form of SCS therapy.“This is the first long-term study to compare the safety and effectiveness of high frequency and traditional SCS therapy for back and leg pain,” said Leonardo Kapural, M.D., lead study author and professor of anesthesiology at Wake Forest University School of Medicine and clinical director at Carolinas Pain Institute at Brookstown in Winston-Salem, N.C. “Chronic back and leg pain have long been considered difficult to treat and current pain relief options such as opioids have limited effectiveness and commonly known side effects. Given the prevalence of chronic pain, high frequency SCS is an exciting advance for our patients.”



SCS is an increasingly common therapy that delivers electric pulses to the spinal cord, through a small device implanted under the skin, for difficult to treat chronic pain in the trunk and limbs. SCS is reversible and is an important option for chronic pain sufferers who otherwise would rely on opioids or back surgery for relief. The new treatment, called HF10™ therapy, uses proprietary high frequency pulses of 10,000 Hz, compared to traditional SCS which uses frequencies of 40 to 60 Hz. HF10 therapy also provides pain relief without paresthesia – a stimulation-induced sensation commonly perceived as tingling or buzzing, which masks a patient’s perception of pain – typical of traditional SCS. These sensations are often distracting or uncomfortable to patients and limit the utility and acceptance of traditional devices. Identifying a new intervention that does not rely on paresthesia to mask pain is novel to SCS and has the potential to improve pain relief and quality of life for these complex patients. In the study, researchers examined 171 patients with chronic back or leg pain who were implanted at 10 comprehensive pain treatment centers. Of these, 90 patients received HF10 therapy, while 81 patients had traditional SCS.



At three months, 85 percent of back pain and 83 percent of leg pain patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain or greater. Conversely, only 44 percent of back pain and 56 percent of leg pain patients in the traditional SCS group experienced a 50 percent reduction in pain. None of the patients in the HF10 therapy group experienced paresthesia. HF10 therapy remained more effective than traditional SCS over the 12 month study period. More patients in the HF10 therapy group reported being “very satisfied” with their pain relief (55 percent versus 32 percent). More than 1.5 billion people worldwide suffer from chronic pain, with lower back pain being the most frequent condition affecting 23 to 26 percent of the population.

"TUCSON, Ariz., July 15, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- Meditation and spiritual fitness are key components in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease according to a new article, ""Stress, Meditation, and Alzheimer's Prevention: Where the Evidence Stands"", published in an early online version of the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease 48(1). The print edition is scheduled to be published in August.

While preliminary studies have suggested a link between meditation, a sense of spirituality or faith and the risk of Alzheimer's disease, the article's author, Dharma Singh Khalsa, M.D., states that a cultivation of higher levels of psycho-social well-being, such as independence, resilience and life purpose represents ""an important new frontier that deserves further research as it is freely available to anyone, anytime, anywhere.""

The article reviews decades of research into the impact that various meditation techniques have had on the prevention of Alzheimer's disease, focusing on one evidence-based practice that Khalsa says can be a powerful part of any Alzheimer's prevention and spiritual fitness program, Kirtan Kriya (KK), a meditation technique which has been successfully used to improve memory in studies of people with subjective cognitive decline and mild cognitive impairment.

Khalsa's article highlights the principles and practices of this 12-minute meditation, with corresponding SPECT scans showing how it successfully activates the posterior cingulate gyrus, an important region of the brain that helps regulate memory and emotional function. The article also summarizes KK's associated benefits, including a diminished loss of brain volume with age, significantly lower levels of depressive symptoms, and greater improvement of mental health, well-being and memory.

""We've been studying the impact of meditation on memory for more than 20 years, and are as encouraged as we've ever been on its powerful role in maximizing brain health,"" said Khalsa, president and medical director of the Alzheimer's Research and Prevention Foundation and a clinical associate professor of integrative medicine at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. ""Science is showing that meditation and spiritual fitness can be an important dimension in battling Alzheimer's, and Kirtan Kriya is a safe, affordable, fast, and effective way to keep the brain spiritually fit.""

"Effectiveness shown in tests on ovarian and bowel cancer

Drug can shut down a cancer cell’s metabolism

Developed by researchers at the University of Warwick’s Warwick Cancer Research Centre

Tests conducted by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute’s Cancer Genome Project

New drug could be cheaper to produce and less harmful to healthy cells

Tests have shown that a new cancer drug, FY26, is 49 times more potent than the clinically used treatment Cisplatin.

Based on a compound of the rare precious metal osmium and developed by researchers at the University of Warwick’s Department of Chemistry and the Warwick Cancer Research Unit, FY26 is able to shut down a cancer cell by exploiting weaknesses inherent in their energy generation.

The researchers argue that the drug could be cheaper to produce, less harmful to healthy cells than existing treatments and has been shown to be active against cancer cells which have become resistant to platinum-based drugs.

The experiments conducted by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute comprising 809 cancer cell lines found that FY26 was 49 times more potent than cisplatin. Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines.

The new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the ‘power house’ of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell’s energy requirements.

In the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy. By stopping this switch of energy source, the drug causes the cancer cell to die.

Lead researcher Professor Peter Sadler, of the University of Warwick’s Department of Chemistry, said explains:

“Healthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria, but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells”.

Commenting on the drug’s benefits when compared to existing platinum-based drugs, such as Cisplatin, Professor Sadler says:

“Platinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging DNA and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting.”

“Existing platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin”.

The research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon:

“Current statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer.

“It is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells”.

The research, supported by the European Research Council and titled Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, is published by PNAS. The paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of FY26, led by PhD student Jess Hearn. Importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of ovarian cancer cells.

Following the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organo-osmium compounds.

"TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hitachi, Ltd. (TSE:6501, “Hitachi”) today announced that Johns Hopkins Medicine has selected Hitachi to provide its proton beam therapy (PBT) system at Sibley Memorial Hospital located in Washington, D.C. This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation’s capital. This will be Hitachi’s fifth PBT system in North America.

The next-generation system “PROBEAT”, which comes with IMPT (Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy) and cone-beam CT, will have improved spot scanning capability in all 3 gantry-type treatment rooms, along with a fixed irradiation room dedicated to cancer research.

Toshiaki Higashihara, President & COO of Hitachi, Ltd. stated that, “We are greatly honored that Johns Hopkins selected Hitachi as their proton partner. As one of the leaders in cancer research and treatment, the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center’s philosophy of being at the leading edge of cancer treatment through research and development is very similar to our Social Innovation concept which supports a healthy and secure society through innovative technologies, systems, solutions and services. The proton center at Sibley Memorial Hospital will be an impressive demonstration of industry and academic medicine collaborating to bring a new technology and new cancer treatment modality to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding communities. Thus, we foresee an exciting, long term relationship that will benefit cancer patients and cancer research.”

In December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the “PROBEAT” system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients.

Given the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world.

Overview of Proton Beam Therapy

Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment.

Overview of Spot Scanning Technology

Unlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation.

"Newswise — MONTREAL June 8, 2015 – Weekly sessions of non-invasive repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation provided sufficient long-term pain relief in 61 percent of patients with central post-stroke pain, and delivered long-term relief for patients who continued for one year, according to a study presented at the International Neuromodulation Society 12th World Congress by Masahito Kobayashi, MD, PhD, of the Department of Neurosurgery, Saitama Medical University – Department of Neurology, Institute of Brain and Blood Vessels, Mihara Memorial Hospital in Saitama, Japan.

Of 18 patients in the open-label series, 11 patients achieved satisfactory-to-excellent pain relief. Pain relief was sustained in six patients who continued treatment for one year. All patients received repetitive transcranial magnetic stimulation (rTMS) to their primary motor cortex once a week for at least 12 weeks.

Satisfactory relief was considered a 40 - 69 percent reduction in pain scores (6 patients) and excellent relief, pain reduction of 70 percent or more (5 patients). Overall, 8 patients who had severe stroke-caused dysesthesias, such as uncomfortable numbness or prickling, experienced less relief than patients without severe dysesthesias, suggesting possible neural circuit damage was inhibiting response to treatment.

The study participants had all been treated medically after a blood clot or bleed in one side of the brain (unilateral ischemic or hemorrhagic stroke). Several weeks into their recovery, they had begun to experience severe hand or leg pain as a consequence of brain damage from the stroke. Such central post-stroke pain can be extremely disabling and difficult to treat, impacting general functioning, mood, and overall quality of life.

Since the 1990s, Japan has been an active center of research into the study of electrical motor cortex stimulation (EMCS) to treat post-stroke pain using surgically implanted devices. The study reported at the INS 12th World Congress builds on observations that electrical motor cortex stimulation’s effectiveness in relieving central post-stroke pain can be predicted by rTMS, suggesting the techniques share similar pain-relief mechanisms.

However, Kobayashi and colleagues point out in their peer-reviewed online publication of this study, “Repetitive Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Once a Week Induces Sustainable Long-Term Relief of Central Poststroke Pain” (Neuromodulation: Technology at the Neural Interface: April 23, 2015)[1] that there has still been controversy about the efficacy of rTMS in post-stroke pain. Kobayashi said in comparison to EMCS, his impression is rTMS efficacy seemed almost the same, without requiring surgery.

In 2014, a review[2] suggested that there is probable efficacy (a level A recommendation) for short-term rTMS treatment of neuropathic pain, including central post-stroke pain, but did not speak to long-term efficacy.

Since pain relief from rTMS increases a few days after treatment, weekly treatment sessions were selected to try to sustain pain relief at treatment intervals that could be maintained on an outpatient basis.

Kobayashi believes neurologists would especially have an interest in this method, which is also attractive due to its low side-effect profile. None of the 18 patients reported any serious side effects from weekly sessions of 10 trains of 10-second 5Hz rTMS, at 90 percent of the active motor threshold. Two patients reported transient, slight scalp discomfort after rTMS.

In addition to the potential of rTMS in pain relief, there has been growing research into noninvasive stimulation to augment progress in physical rehabilitation soon after stroke. It is believed that the stimulation aids in plasticity, the ability of the brain to gradually form new neural connections to take on functions previously performed by damaged areas.

A first phase of the study assessed whether rTMS had a treatment effect on pain. In it, the research team randomly assigned six patients to receive either sham or active rTMS one week and the other treatment the next, measuring pain scores before and after each session.

Once that phase had shown that rTMS did reduce the patients’ pain, an open-label treatment phase began. In this second phase, the 18 patients underwent 12 weekly rTMS sessions. The patients’ pain scores were measured just before each weekly session.

Data were collected for eight years, ending in 2014. Kobayashi said that some patients really hoped to continue rTMS after the study because their pain worsened after rTMS treatment sessions were over, and almost all the patients said that after the study ended, their pain increased to the level before rTMS.

He added that the remaining question to answer is whether the level of the patients’ severe uncontrollable pain would continue to decrease if rTMS continued for several years.",1

Breastfeeding for six months or longer was associated with a lower risk of childhood leukemia compared with children who were never breastfed or who were breastfed for a shorter time, according to an article published online by JAMA Pediatrics.

Leukemia is the most common childhood cancer and accounts for about 30 percent of all childhood cancers. Still, little is known about its cause. Breast milk is meant to exclusively supply all the nutritional needs of infants and current recommendations include exclusively breastfeeding for the first six months of life to optimize growth, development and health.

Efrat L. Amitay, Ph.D., M.P.H., and Lital Keinan-Boker, M.D., Ph.D., M.P.H., of the University of Haifa, Israel, reviewed the evidence in 18 studies on the association between breastfeeding and childhood leukemia.

In a review of all 18 studies, the authors found breastfeeding for six months or longer was associated with a 19 percent lower risk compared with no breastfeeding or breastfeeding for a shorter period of time. A separate analysis of 15 studies found that ever being breastfed compared with never being breastfed was associated with an 11 percent lower risk of childhood leukemia.

The authors suggest several biological mechanisms of breast milk may explain their results, including that breast milk contains many immunologically active components and anti-inflammatory defense mechanisms that influence the development of an infant’s immune system.

“Because the primary goal of public health is prevention of morbidity, health care professionals should be taught the potential health benefits of breastfeeding and given tools to assist mothers with breastfeeding, whether themselves or with referrals to others who can help. The many potential preventive health benefits of breastfeeding should also be communicated openly to the general public, not only to mothers, so breastfeeding can be more socially accepted and facilitated. In addition, more high-quality studies are needed to clarify the biological mechanisms underlying this association between breastfeeding and lower childhood leukemia morbidity,” the study concludes.

Allowing more basic emergency medical service (EMS) staff to administer naloxone could reduce drug overdose deaths that involve opioids, according to a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) study, “Disparity in Naloxone Administration by Emergency Medical Service Providers and the Burden of Drug Overdose in Rural Communities,” published in the American Journal of Public Health.

In 2013, more than 16,000 deaths in the United States involved prescription opioids, and more than 8,000 others were related to heroin. Naloxone is a prescription drug that can reverse the effects of prescription opioid and heroin overdose, and can be life-saving if administered in time.

According to the study findings, advanced EMS staff were more likely than basic EMS staff to administer naloxone. A majority of states have adopted national guidelines that prohibit basic EMS staff from administering the drug as an injection. As of 2014, only 12 states allowed basic EMS staff to administer naloxone for a suspected opioid overdose; all 50 states allow advanced EMS staff to administer the overdose reversal treatment.

“Opioid overdose deaths are devastating families and communities, especially in rural areas,” said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. “Many of these deaths can be prevented by improving prescribing practices to prevent opioid addiction, expanding the use of medication-assisted treatment, and increasing use of naloxone for suspected overdoses. Having trained EMS staff to administer naloxone in rural areas will save lives.”

To reduce opioid overdose deaths, particularly in rural areas, CDC recommends expanding training on the administration of naloxone to all emergency service staff, and helping basic EMS personnel meet the advanced certification requirements.

“Naloxone can be given nasally to a person suspected of overdose, allowing basic EMS staff to administer the drug without injection,” said CDC Senior Health Scientist Mark Faul, Ph.D., M.A. “Naloxone is non-addictive, and expanding training on how to administer the drug can help basic emergency medical service staff reverse an opioid overdose and save more lives.”

National Emergency Medicine Service Information System data for 2012 were reviewed to better understand factors associated with naloxone administration, including demographic data, 911 call information, and details about the scene of an injury or illness as reported by EMS staff.

The findings indicate naloxone was most likely to be administered to women, people between the ages of 20 and 29, and people living in suburban areas.

In general, the rate of opioid overdose death was 45 percent higher in rural areas compared with urban areas. The use of naloxone by rural EMS staff, however, was only 22.5 percent higher when compared with urban EMS naloxone use.

Department of Health and Human Services Secretary Sylvia M. Burwell has made addressing opioid abuse, dependence, and overdose a priority and work is underway at multiple HHS agencies on this important issue. HHS’ Health Resources Services Administration recently released a grant opportunity aimed at reducing opioid overdose deaths in rural communities through funding for communities to purchase naloxone and train health care professionals and emergency medical staff on its use.

CDC works with states, communities, and prescribers to prevent opioid misuse and overdose by tracking and monitoring the epidemic and helping states scale up effective programs. CDC also improves patient safety by equipping health care providers with data, tools, and guidance so they can make informed treatment decisions. Learn more at www.cdc.gov/DrugOverdose.

"SAN DIEGO, April 24, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- University of Louisville announced today results from the Soft Tissue Ablation Registry (STAR), demonstrating that irreversible electroporation (IRE) with the NanoKnife® System, in combination with chemotherapy, doubled the overall survival rate of locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer patients to nearly 24 months. The data was presented at the American Surgical Association annual meeting in San Diego. Locally advanced pancreatic cancer is Stage III cancer that has not yet spread.

Pancreatic cancer has one of the highest mortality rates of all cancers and is expected to climb from the fourth leading cause of cancer-related death in the U.S. to the second by 2020. Ninety four percent of pancreatic cancer patients will die within five years of diagnosis, and 74% of patients die within the first year of diagnosis.

""The STAR data adds to the growing body of evidence that IRE ablation may represent a new treatment paradigm for patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer,"" said Robert Martin, M.D., Ph.D., F.A.C.S., director of the Division of Surgical Oncology, and Professor, Department of Surgery, University of Louisville, James Graham Brown Cancer Center. ""This new analysis of IRE could help change the standard of care for Stage III pancreatic cancer patients whose only treatment options until now were chemotherapy or a combination of chemo-radiation therapy, which will only stabilize the disease and not destroy the tumor. With IRE, these patients now have a surgical treatment option to augment their treatment plan.""

The NanoKnife® IRE system is a tool that destroys cancerous cells by subjecting them to a series of short electrical pulses using high-voltage direct current that does not injure surrounding cells, blood vessels and other vital structures. IRE overcomes rapid growth of the tumor by killing all malignant cells at once so they cannot continue to grow and spread. The NanoKnife® IRE system is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the surgical ablation of soft tissue. It is not approved for use in specific cancers.

About STAR

STAR was a retrospective analysis of IRE performed on 200 consecutive patients diagnosed with locally advanced (Stage III) pancreatic cancer (LAPC) at six centers in the U.S. The centers that collaborated on the study included University of Louisville, Louisville, KY; Henry Ford Hospital, Detroit, MI; Cleveland Clinic, Cleveland, OH; Piedmont Hospital, Atlanta, GA; Swedish Medical Center, Denver, CO; and Cancer Treatment Centers of America, Atlanta, GA.

From July 2010 to October 2014, patients with radiographic Stage III LAPC were treated with IRE and monitored under a multicenter, prospective IRB-approved registry. Perioperative 90-day outcomes, local failure, and overall survival were recorded and compared to standard of care data for Stage III LAPC. All patients underwent induction chemotherapy with 52 percent receiving chemo-radiation, for a median of 7 months (range, 5-13) prior to IRE. IRE was successfully administered to all patients. Nineteen percent sustained complications with a median grade of 2 (range 1-3). Median length of stay was 6 days (range, 4-58) with a median follow-up of 25 months. Six patients (3%) had local recurrence. Median overall survival in both groups was 23.5 months.

"Newswise — LOS ANGELES (EMBARGOED UNTIL 7 A.M. EDT on APRIL 14, 2015) – An injection of stem cells into the eye may soon slow or reverse the effects of early-stage age-related macular degeneration, according to new research from scientists at Cedars-Sinai. Currently, there is no treatment that slows the progression of the disease, which is the leading cause of vision loss in people over 65.

“This is the first study to show preservation of vision after a single injection of adult-derived human cells into a rat model with age-related macular degeneration,” said Shaomei Wang, MD, PhD, lead author of the study published in the journal STEM CELLS and a research scientist in the Eye Program at the Cedars-Sinai Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute.

The stem cell injection resulted in 130 days of preserved vision in laboratory rats, which roughly equates to 16 years in humans. Age-related macular degeneration affects upward of 15 million Americans. It occurs when the small central portion of the retina, known as the macula, deteriorates. The retina is the light-sensing nerve tissue at the back of the eye. Macular degeneration may also be caused by environmental factors, aging and a genetic predisposition.

When animal models with macular degeneration were injected with induced neural progenitor stem cells, which derive from the more commonly known induced pluripotent stem cells, healthy cells began to migrate around the retina and formed a protective layer. This protective layer prevented ongoing degeneration of the vital retinal cells responsible for vision.

Cedars-Sinai researchers in the Induced Pluripotent Stem Cell (iPSC) Core, directed by Dhruv Sareen, PhD, with support from the David and Janet Polak Foundation Stem Cell Core Laboratory, first converted adult human skin cells into powerful induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSC), which can be expanded indefinitely and then made into any cell of the human body. In this study, these induced pluripotent stem cells were then directed toward a neural progenitor cell fate, known as induced neural progenitor stem cells, or iNPCs.

“These induced neural progenitor stem cells are a novel source of adult-derived cells which should have powerful effects on slowing down vision loss associated with macular degeneration,” said Clive Svendsen, PhD, director of the Board of Governors Regenerative Medicine Institute and contributing author to the study. “Though additional pre-clinical data is needed, our institute is close to a time when we can offer adult stem cells as a promising source for personalized therapies for this and other human diseases.”

Next steps include testing the efficacy and safety of the stem cell injection in preclinical animal studies to provide information for applying for an investigational new drug. From there, clinical trials will be designed to test potential benefit in patients with later-stage age-related macular degeneration.

Additional Cedars-Sinai authors include Dhruv Sareen, PhD; Yuchun Tsai, PhD; Bin Lu, MD, PhD; Benjamin Bakondi, PhD; Sergey Girman, PhD; and Anais Sahabian, PhD.

"Newswise — A decrease in the amount of time spent eating and an increase in overnight fasting reduces glucose levels and may reduce the risk of breast cancer among women, report University of California, San Diego School of Medicine researchers in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.

The findings were presented at the American Association of Cancer Research’s annual meeting in Philadelphia.

“Increasing the duration of overnight fasting could be a novel strategy to reduce the risk of developing breast cancer,” said Catherine Marinac, UC San Diego doctoral candidate and first author on the paper. “This is a simple dietary change that we believe most women can understand and adopt. It may have a big impact on public health without requiring complicated counting of calories or nutrients.”

Women who fasted for longer periods of time overnight had significantly better control over blood glucose concentrations. The data shows that each three hour increase in nighttime fasting was associated with a 4 percent lower postprandial glucose level, regardless of how much women ate.

“The dietary advice for cancer prevention usually focuses on limiting consumption of red meat, alcohol and refined grains while increasing plant-based foods,” said co-author Ruth Patterson, PhD, UC San Diego Moores Cancer Center associate director for population sciences and program leader of the cancer prevention program. “New evidence suggests that when and how often people eat can also play a role in cancer risk.”

Women in the study reported eating five times per day with a mean nighttime fasting of 12 hours. Those who reported longer fast durations also indicated they consumed fewer calories per day, ate fewer calories after 10 p.m. and had fewer eating episodes.

Researchers recommend large-scale clinical trials to confirm that nighttime fasting results in favorable changes to biomarkers of glycemic control and breast cancer risk.

Co-authors include Loki Natarajan, Dorothy Sears and Sheri Hartman of UC San Diego; and Linda Gallo and Elva Arredondo of San Diego State University.

Funding for this research came, in part, from the National Cancer Institute-sponsored Ruth L. Kirschstein National Research Service Award (1F31CA183125-01A1), the NCI Centers for Transdisciplinary Research on Energetics and Cancer (1U54CA155435-01) and philanthropic support from Ms. Carol Vassiliadis and family.

"Scientists have found an unexpected use for virtual reality headsets: to help pinpoint people who may later develop Alzheimer’s disease.

The devices, widely used by computer gamers, display images that can be used to test the navigational skills of people thought to be at risk of dementia. Those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to Alzheimer’s later in life, scientists now believe.

By identifying potential patients far earlier than is possible at present, researchers hope it should then become easier in the long term to develop treatments aimed at halting or slowing their condition.

“It is usually thought memory is the first attribute affected in Alzheimer’s,” said project leader Dennis Chan, a neuroscientist based at Cambridge University. “But difficulty with navigation is increasingly recognised as one of the very earliest symptoms. This may predate the onset of other symptoms.

“By pinpointing those who are beginning to lose their navigational skills, we hope to show that we can target people at a much earlier stage of the condition and one day become far more effective in treating them.”

The discovery that loss of navigational skills was associated with Alzheimer’s disease was made several years ago by Chan and colleagues based at several centres in the UK. These studies used tablet computers to test navigational tasks.

But now scientists plan to take their tests to a new level with the use of the virtual reality sets in which wearers are immersed in simulated environments through which they must navigate.

Around 300 people, aged between 40 and 60, will be recruited to take part in the study. Some will have a gene that puts them at risk of the condition or will come from a family with a history of Alzheimer’s. Not all will be destined to be affected by the disease, however. Chan’s project aims to find out who will.

Wearing virtual reality headsets, participants will be asked to navigate their way towards, and then remember details of, a series of different environments.

“We will make a note of those who have particular problems and see if these are the ones who are at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s,” explained Chan. “The aim of the study is very simple: can we detect changes in brain function before people are aware that they have them?”

Researchers recently pinpointed the significance of a tiny area of the brain known as the entorhinal cortex, which acts as a hub in a widespread brain network that controls navigation. This now appears to be the first part of the brain that succumbs to Alzheimer’s.

“The entorhinal cortex is the first brain region to show degeneration when you get Alzheimer’s, and that is where we shall be focusing our research,” said Chan, whose work is funded by the Alzheimer’s Society.

The goal of the work is to help people as they develop the disease. “To date, drug trials for Alzheimer’s have been applied when people have already got dementia, by which time considerable damage to the brain has already occurred,” Chan told the Observer.

“If we can develop drugs and administer them earlier, for instance before the disease has spread beyond the entorhinal cortex, then this would have the potential to prevent the onset of dementia.”",0
"A Chicago couple who previously suffered two miscarriages recently welcomed a healthy baby boy thanks to a breakthrough new fertility test which helps women struggling with achieving a successful pregnancy by examining the mother's DNA.

The test is offering new hope to many family's struggling to conceive.

Carolyn Bilson and Tim O'Brien met three years ago, and say it was love at first sight.

""Literally a month later we knew, we wanted to have children,"" Bilson told ""Good Morning America.""

ABC News

But after two miscarriages, Bilson, then pushing 40, said the couple sought help from a fertility specialist in Chicago who recommended in vitro fertilization.

Their first attempt at IVF, however, failed too, according to Bilson.

""I think it was just so devastating, because we didn't anticipate that,"" she said. ""We thought the hard part would be getting pregnant, not staying pregnant.""

O'Brien added that the most ""frustrating thing"" was that ""you didn't learn anything from the previous miscarriage. So, there wasn't, 'What could we do differently?'""

The couple then learned about a new way to tailor fertility treatments specifically to the DNA of the mother, using a test that can help couples figure out the perfect time for conception, based on that DNA.

ABCNews.com

The Endometrial Receptivity Test uses a tissue sample to look at 238 genes to find out the optimum time for conception, thus increasing the couple's chance to conceive.

For Bilson, that time is two days later than the average woman.

Dr. Ilan Tur-Kaspa, an OB-GYN and the director of Chicago's Institute for Human Reproduction, described the process as ""personalized medicine.""

ABC News

""This is what we are trying to do here by personalized medicine,"" Tur-Kaspa said, adding that you can ""make sure"" that ""the uterus is ready, and optimize a time for implantation.""

The result: Their beautiful baby Westley, who is now nine months old.

""We're so lucky,"" Bilson said. ""We're so blessed.""

ABC News

OB-GYN Dr. Jessica Shepherd told ""GMA"" that this breakthrough new treatment is very exciting to the medical community because it offers another avenue for women who have recurrent miscarriages to potentially get pregnant, when it is something they never thought they could look forward to.

The new technique works by having a doctor take a sample of the women's endometrial tissue, which you can get DNA from, and from that DNA you can tell what part of the cycle is prime time to take the fertilized egg and implant it via IVF, Shepherd added.

Shepherd said that the ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over 40, but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum.

One risk of the procedure many women may not take into account is the emotional effects of it not working and you still miscarrying, Shepherd said. It is a new process and important to go over the risks of the procedure -- which can vary per person -- with your health care provider.",1
"(Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson said its drug, Tremfya, was found to be more effective than a rival medicine from Novartis AG in reducing the severity and affected area in adults with moderate-to-severe plaque psoriasis in a late-stage study.

FILE PHOTO - A Johnson & Johnson building is shown in Irvine, California, U.S., January 24, 2017. REUTERS/Mike Blake

After 48 weeks of therapy, 84.5 percent of the 1,048 participants treated with Tremfya showed 90 percent improvement in disease symptoms, as measured by the Psoriasis Area Severity Index, compared with 70 percent on Novartis’s Cosentyx, J&J said.

J&J is positioning Tremfya as a better alternative to Cosentyx as it seeks to take market share away from Novartis’s drug, which was launched two years ago and is among the top-selling treatments in the $11 billion global psoriasis market.

That market is expected to double to $21.11 billion by 2022, according to U.S. consultant Grand View Research.

With $2.1 billion in sales in 2017, Cosentyx has become one of the top revenue earners for Novartis and is expected to make up for falling revenue from its blood cancer treatment, Gleevec, whose patent expired two years ago.

On a media briefing following the release of J&J’s trial results, Novartis said it expected the data to have “limited clinical relevance” and no impact on plans to expand the Cosentyx label.

J&J also said Cosentyx demonstrated quicker effectiveness than Tremfya during the study.

“These results imply that Cosentyx remains a good option for moderate-to-severe psoriasis patients that want to achieve more rapid skin clearance,” brokerage Jefferies wrote in a note following the results.

“We see Cosentyx secure as a mainstay psoriasis therapy.”

Psoriasis is a chronic condition that causes an overproduction of skin cells, resulting in inflamed, red lesions or plaques, which can be itchy and painful.

About 7.5 million Americans live with plaque psoriasis, of which 20 percent have moderate-to-severe form of the disease, J&J said.

Tremfya, first approved in July 2017 as a plaque psoriasis treatment in the United States, is also being tested as a for psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease.

TUESDAY, Nov. 27, 2018 (HealthDay News) --What if a simple zap to the spine could relieve the debilitating lower back and leg pain brought on by a herniated disk?

Such is the promise of ""pulse radiofrequency"" therapy (pRF), which sends inflammation-reducing pulses of energy to nerve roots in the spine, a new study claims.

The therapy is not new, having first received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in the 1980s.

But recent advances in CT scan technology now enable clinicians to deploy those energy pulses with much more accuracy, experts said. And the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick.

""I was amazed with the results of pRF,"" said study author Dr. Alessandro Napoli. ""Especially having read, as a radiologist, numerous lumbar MRI scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery.""

And as a patient himself, Napoli added that ""from personal experience I can tell you that the treatment is not painful, and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting 10 minutes.""

Napoli is a professor of interventional radiology at Sapienza University of Rome in Italy.

He and his colleagues plan to report their findings Tuesday at the Radiological Society of North America annual meeting, in Chicago. Such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Lower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open, allowing jelly-like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots. Beyond lower back pain, the condition often triggers sciatica, a pain that radiates down a patient's leg.

Standard therapies include over-the-counter pain meds, corticosteroid spinal injections, and/or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion.

The problem, said Napoli, is that such options entail risks without assured relief.

""Steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients, and generally require more sessions,"" he noted. And though surgery safety has ""largely improved,"" Napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection, the need for a minimum two- to three-day hospital stay, the high cost, and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit.

By contrast, pRF is scalpel-free, delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a CT scan-guided electrode. The process, said Napoli, requires no hospital stay, is noninvasive, far cheaper and less risky.

""The rationale for using pRF on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root,"" he explained. ""Without inflammation the pain fades, and the body starts a self-healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients.""

For the study, the Italian investigators compared 128 lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single 10-minute round of CT-guided pRF with 120 patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections.

All the patients had already undergone standard interventions, with poor results.

By the one-year mark following either treatment, a full ""perceived"" recovery was reported by 95 percent of the pRF patients, compared with just 61 percent of the steroid injection patients.

Dr. Daniel Park, director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at William Beaumont Hospital in Royal Oak, Mich., offered some caution on the findings.

He noted that because ""the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone,"" it remains an open question as to whether the pRF procedure really cured the condition.

Still, Park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient's pain, given that ""the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it, and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain.""

Nevertheless, he remains unsure if pRF is truly ready for prime time.

""Best case, I think [pRF] could be an option for people if they [have already] failed therapy and medication,"" said Park. ""It may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections, but they need more treatment. I think this is experimental, and should not be first-line.""

An experimental vaccine that could hold off Alzheimer's disease showed promising results in animal testing, according to researchers at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.

Testing in mice showed that the vaccine safely prevents the buildup of substances in the brain associated with the fatal disease, the team reported this week in the journal Alzheimer's Research & Therapy.

There has been research in monkeys and rabbits as well, and the researchers hope the vaccine will progress to human trials.

If the vaccine proves safe and effective in humans, it could slice the number of dementia diagnoses in half, the study's senior author told USA TODAY.

Dementia is a term used to broadly describe symptoms of cognitive decline; Alzheimer's disease is the most common cause of dementia.

Doris Lambracht-Washington, a professor of neurology and neurotherapeutics at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, said researchers believe the vaccine could extend lives by preventing the disease from developing.

“If the onset of the disease could be delayed by even five years, that would be enormous for the patients and their families,” Lambracht-Washington said in a statement. “The number of dementia cases could drop by half.”

Lambracht-Washington said the study marks major progress toward a safe and effective vaccine.

Previous attempts to find an Alzheimer's vaccine either caused harmful side effects, such as brain inflammation, or used less effective approaches, she said.

The vaccine works by prompting the body to produce antibodies inhibiting the buildup of amyloid and tau, two proteins that are hallmarks of the degenerative brain disease.

The vaccine is one of several promising treatments aimed at reducing the buildup of those substances before they become deadly plaques and tangles in the brain.

About 5.7 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the University of Texas. The number could double by 2050.",1
"Scientists are inching closer to a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life-threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption. While the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy, it has proven successful in building up patients’ tolerance to peanuts over time, lessening the potential for life-threatening complications.

“We’re excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it,” said allergist Stephen Tilles, MD, ACAAI former president, study co-author and consulting advisor for Aimmune Therapeutics, according to EurekAlert. “Our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day, many would tolerate as much as two peanuts. We were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to 12 months of treatment, and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts.”

FDA WARNS AGAINST HONEY PACIFIERS AFTER TEXAS INFANTS HOSPITALIZED WITH 'RARE' ILLNESS

The results, which were presented Sunday at the College of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology Annual Scientific Meeting and published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were based on study participants ranging in age from 4 to 55 years old. All participants, who mostly fell between ages 4 and 17, had a peanut allergy, but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time.

Participants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board-certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge (OFC).

“Reactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment,” Tilles said, according to EurekAlert. “On average, the participants were able to tolerate a 100-fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning. In addition, the symptoms caused by the 100-fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study.”

EXPERTS: CHILDREN AT RISK OF LEAD POISONING IN CHATTANOOGA

With FDA approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies. The study’s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy.

“This is not a quick fix, and it doesn’t mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want,” Jay Lieberman, MD, vice chair of the ACAAI Food Allergy Committee and study co-author, said, according to EurekAlert. “But it is definitely a breakthrough. The hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of 2019. If that happens, people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures.",1

"(CNN) A five-minute neck scan could predict a person's risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge, researchers have said.

The test, which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck, could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline, according to the study by scientists at University College London (UCL), who presented their work Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference.

A group of almost 3,200 patients, aged 58-74, had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002, before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years, from 2002 to 2016.

People with the most intense pulses, which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow, were up to 50% more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions, the research found, because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brain's network of blood vessels.

Pulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down -- usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use -- and can no longer ""cushion"" the blood flow coming from the heart.

""If you can detect [the risk] in people in mid-life, it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle,"" said Dr. Scott Chiesa, post-doctoral researcher at UCL.

""What's good for the arteries is good for the brain,"" he added in summary of his findings. ""Dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging. How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline.""

If the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age.

And the scans would be ""well set up for routine testing,"" according to Chiesa. ""It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do.""

When healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain.

But damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study.

""What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,"" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research.

Vascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia.

Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases.

Around 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide, according to the World Health Organization , with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050.

In the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics.

'Promising findings'

The study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations.

""Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,"" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK.

But he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: ""The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia.""

There is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms.

""Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next.""

Previous studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level , but its effects remain largely incurable.

More research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia.

""While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,"" said Routledge.

Routledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.",1
"Artificial intelligence can be used to spot Alzheimer's six years before a patient would normally be diagnosed, a study shows.

Doctors used the self-learning computer to detect changes in brain scans too subtle for humans to see.

The system was able to identify dementia in 40 patients an average of six years before they were formally diagnosed.

British AI expert Prof Noel Sharkey, from the University of Sheffield, said of the findings: ""This is exactly the sort of task that deep learning is cut out for - finding high-level patterns in data.

""Although the sample sizes and test sets were relatively small, the results are so promising that a much larger study would be worthwhile.""

Boffins from the University of California trained the computer using more than 2,100 scans from 1,002 patients.

The scans measure brain activity by tracking the uptake of a radioactive liquid injected into the blood.

Research has linked the development of Alzheimer's to particular changes in certain brain regions but these can be difficult to spot.

The Alzheimer's algorithm was able to teach itself to recognize patterns in brain scans that indicated disease.

As a final test, it was given a set of 40 scans from 40 patients it had never studied before.

It proved to be 100 percent accurate at detecting Alzheimer's disease many years before the patient was later diagnosed.

Dr Jae Ho Sohn, who worked on the project, said: ""We were very pleased with the algorithm's performance.

""It was able to predict every single case that advanced to Alzheimer's disease.""

Early detection of Alzheimer's could open the door to new ways of slowing down or even halting the progression of the disease.

Dr Carol Routledge, from Alzheimer's Research UK, said: ""The diseases that cause dementia begin in the brain up to 20 years before any symptoms start to show, presenting a vital window of opportunity for us to intervene before widespread damage occurs.

""This study highlights the potential of machine learning to assist with the early detection of diseases like Alzheimer's, but the findings will need to be confirmed in much larger groups of people before we can properly assess the power of this approach.""

The research is published in the latest issue of the journal Radiology.

"The FDA has approved a new flu medication in the form of a single-dose pill.

Interested in Flu Season? Add Flu Season as an interest to stay up to date on the latest Flu Season news, video, and analysis from ABC News. Add Interest

The medication, called XOFLUZA, was designed to make the flu shorter if taken within 48 hours of onset and can be prescribed to patients 12 and older once they've been diagnosed with the illness, according to the FDA.

The new medication is designed to significantly reduced the duration of flu symptoms by more than one day, when compared to a placebo in clinical trials, the FDA said.

Researchers believe the medication will prevent patients from spreading the flu, which could help reign in contagion rates following the 2017-2018 flu season, which saw 900,000 hospitalizations and 80,000 deaths -- the deadliest season in four decades, according to the FDA. The medication was approved under a priority review.

The medication is the first in a new class of antiviral medications that blocks an enzyme within the flu virus, which stops viral replication early in the influenza cycle, the FDA announced.

XOFLUZA is similar to Oseltamivir, also known under the brand name Tamiflu, but ""decreases viral shedding faster"" and is associated with less side effects, Dr. Todd Ellerin, the infectious disease specialist at South Shore Hospital in Massachusetts, told ABC News.

""Like Tamiflu, it seems to work better the quicker it gets into the patient,"" Ellerin said.

In clinical trials, XOFLUZA demonstrated efficacy against a wide range of influenza, including Tamiflu-resistant strains, and has also proved effective against some strains of Asian bird flu, such as H5N1, according to the FDA.

The medication is the ""first new flu medicine"" of its kind -- with a novel proposed mechanism -- in nearly 20 years, said Dr. Sandra Horning, chief medical officer and head of global product development at Genentech, the company selling the pill in the U.S., in a statement to ABC News.

""If patients see their doctors within 48 hours of symptom onset, one dose of XOFLUZA can significantly reduce the duration of flu symptoms,"" Horning said.

"ZURICH (Reuters) - An experimental cancer drug that Novartis hopes will raise the profile of its oncology portfolio cut the risk of death or disease progression by more than a third in breast cancer patients with a hard-to-target gene mutation.

FILE PHOTO: Swiss drugmaker Novartis' logo is seen at the company's plant in the northern Swiss town of Stein, Switzerland October 23, 2017. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo

The Swiss drugmaker’s BYL719, a so-called PI3K inhibitor also known as alpelisib, combined with hormone therapy fulvestrant boosted median progression-free survival (PFS) to 11 months, up from 5.7 months for patients who got only hormone therapy, the company said on Saturday.

BYL719 plus fulvestrant cut risk of death or progression in those patients by an estimated 35 percent, Novartis said.

Novartis said earlier this year that this study, called SOLAR-1, of hormone receptor positive, HER2- breast cancer with mutations of the PIK3CA gene showed that YL719 helped patients.

But this specific benefit data is being released on Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology’s annual conference in Munich.

Even though PIK3CA mutations are the most common genetic change in hormone-receptor positive breast cancer, trials of agents seeking to put a brake on this pathway to tumor growth have largely disappointed including on safety issues.

Other drugmakers including Roche have seen similar investigational medicines stumble, making Novartis’s progress here hopeful news, doctors involved in the trial said.

“The results of SOLAR-1 are the most encouraging observed to date from a trial evaluating a PI3K inhibitor” for patients with this kind of breast cancer, said Fabrice Andre, a professor at France’s Institut Gustave Roussy.

“These data have the potential to allow physicians to address an unmet need in this patient population by using a biomarker-driven treatment to inform their sequencing decisions,” Andre added.

Like other companies, Novartis is seeking to personalize treatment for cancer patients by using biomarkers like those showing PIK3CA gene mutations to help guide treatment.

TALKS WITH REGULATORS

This week, Novartis signed a deal to have Roche unit Foundation Medicine provide genomic profiling of patient samples taken from Novartis’ clinical oncology trials. Other cancer drugmakers like Bristol-Myers Squibb and Merck also have Foundation deals.

Samit Hirawat, head of Novartis’s cancer drug development, said in an interview the side-effects profile of alpelisib held up.

“We don’t see as much diarrhea, we do not have CNS (central nervous system) side effects, we do not have the liver effects,” he said.

Novartis plans to file with regulators for approval of the drug this year, Hirawat said, adding he also has strategies to broaden the indication, including tough-to-treat triple-negative breast cancer.

“PIK3CA mutations are present in many other tumor types,” Hirawat said. “There is a larger program we are putting into place.”",1

THURSDAY, Oct. 18, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- In what researchers are calling a ""breakthrough,"" two preliminary trials have found that either of two triple-drug regimens could potentially benefit 90 percent of people with cystic fibrosis.

The trials were short-term, finding that the drug combinations improved adult patients' lung function over four weeks. But experts said they were optimistic the results will hold up in the larger, longer-term trials already underway.

What's most exciting, they said, is that the triple-drug approach could open up new options to nearly all cystic fibrosis patients.

""This is not a cure for cystic fibrosis,"" stressed Dr. Steven Rowe, who led one of the trials. ""But it could be game-changing.""

Cystic fibrosis (CF) is a genetic disorder that causes persistent lung infections. Over time, extensive lung damage leads to respiratory failure. At one time, children with CF usually died before they reached school age. But with improved treatments, the typical life expectancy is now about 40 years, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation.

Cystic fibrosis is caused by various mutations in a gene called CFTR. In the past several years, drugs that target those underlying genetics have become available. Known as CFTR modulators, they were heralded as a major advance in treating the disorder.

However, they work well only for a small number of people with certain CFTR mutations, explained Rowe, director of the Cystic Fibrosis Research Center at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

The most common mutation that causes cystic fibrosis is called F508del -- and it has proven tougher to tackle, Rowe said.

About half of people with CF carry two copies of the mutation (one inherited from each parent). For them, a combination of two existing CFTR modulators can ease breathing problems -- but the overall effects are only ""modest,"" Rowe said.

Then there's the 30 percent of CF patients who carry only one copy of F508del, plus another defect known as a ""minimal-function"" mutation. For them, the existing CFTR modulators do not work at all.

Both new trials focused on those two groups of patients. The results are published in the Oct. 18 New England Journal of Medicine, to coincide with the researchers' presentation at a North American Cystic Fibrosis meeting, in Denver.

Rowe's team tested a combination of two available CFTR modulators -- tezacaftor and ivacaftor -- plus an experimental one, known as VX-659. The other trial used the same existing drugs, along with a similar new drug, dubbed VX-445.

Rowe's team randomly assigned 54 adults with cystic fibrosis to either take the triple-drug regimen or be in a comparison group. In the comparison group, patients with one F508del mutation took placebo pills, while patients with two copies of the mutation took tezacaftor and ivacaftor alone.

After four weeks, the trial found, the triple-drug therapy had improved lung function in patients with both types of mutations. Their performance on a test called FEV1 rose by as much as 13 percentage points, on average -- what Rowe described as a ""pronounced improvement.""

The other trial had nearly identical results.

This is the first time, Rowe said, that CFTR modulator therapy has ""pushed the needle"" for patients with one F508del mutation.

An editorial published with the studies said they ""represent a major breakthrough.""

Now the questions are whether the improved lung function can be sustained, and whether the drugs prevent symptom exacerbations and other complications, wrote Dr. Fernando Holguin, of the University of Colorado, Aurora.

Vertex Pharmaceuticals, Inc. is developing both experimental drugs.

""The ability of these potential drugs to treat individuals with a single F508del mutation means that more people than ever before could benefit,"" said Dr. Michael Boyle, senior vice president for therapeutics at the foundation. ""This is very exciting news for our community.""

Rowe agreed there are still important questions about the triple-drug regimens. One is, how well do they work for younger patients?

Patients as young as 12 are included in the larger ongoing trials, Rowe said.

So far, the treatments appear safe. Most side effects in the four-week trials were ""mild to moderate,"" the researchers said, and included cough, headache and increased sputum.

If the experimental drugs are ultimately approved, there will be the real-world issue of price.

Vertex currently markets the combination of tezacaftor and ivacaftor as Symdeko -- at a reported list price of $292,000 a year.

In the United States, more than 30,000 people have cystic fibrosis, according to the foundation.

TUESDAY, Oct. 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating a specific set of nerves that are nestled along the spine may deliver relief to those who suffer from chronic back pain and cut the need for opioid painkillers, new research suggests.

The therapy, which targets the root ganglion nerves, is more effective than other spine stimulation procedures because it places tiny leads precisely at the area where pain originates, unlike other devices that provide more generalized stimulation, the researchers said.

""In certain patients who have not gotten relief from other treatments, this therapy may give sustained pain relief and may allow them to reduce opioids for at least 18 months and perhaps longer,"" said lead researcher Robert McCarthy. He's a professor of anesthesiology at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago.

The dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells, on both sides of each of the spine's vertebra, and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body, spinal cord and brain. Stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain, the researchers explained.

A pacemaker-like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain, McCarthy said.

The pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness. The strength of stimulation, programmed by a doctor, is based on the patient's level of pain, he said.

The treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation, McCarthy said. In spinal cord stimulation, a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine, but the pulses don't target the specific pain source.

In addition, dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain, McCarthy said.

The goal of this study, he said, was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period. McCarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in 67 people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to 18 months. Among the participants, 17 had the device for over a year.

Before receiving the device, most patients rated their pain as an 8 on a scale of one to 10, with 10 being the worst. For most patients, the device reduced pain by 33 percent, which was significant, the researchers reported.

In addition, patients said they experienced a 27 percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain. In all, 94 percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial.

The procedure was not without complications. Five patients needed to have the wires implanted again, two patients had them removed because they were infected, and one had the device removed because of a complication.

McCarthy said the therapy is not widely available, even though it was approved by the FDA in 2016. At the moment, its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device.

Also, the procedure isn't covered by all insurance companies, so out-of-pocket costs to patients can be very high. It is, however, covered by Medicare, he said.

For uninsured patients, the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from $15,000 to $50,000 or more, according to a 2008 report funded by the Washington State Department of Labor and Industries.

Spine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment, according to Blue Cross Blue Shield. Other insurance companies may have varying policies.

McCarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available, especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain.

One pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure.

""The results of this study are very significant,"" said Dr. Kiran Patel, director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

It shows long-term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements, she said.

""In my pain practice and career, dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain,"" Patel said.

""I encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate,"" she said.

The findings were presented Sunday at the American Society of Anesthesiologists annual meeting, in San Francisco. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Two doses of Stelara, already approved for psoriasis, psoriatic arthritis and Crohn’s disease, was tested in 961 patients with moderate-to-severe ulcerative colitis (UC) who had failed prior therapy.

Both 6 mg/kg and 130 mg doses of the intravenous treatment showed clinical remission in significantly more patients, compared with those on placebo, after eight weeks, the company said.

The treatment and the placebo arms reported similar proportion of side effects, with one patient on the 6 mg/kg dose dying following excessive bleeding, J&J said.

SUNDAY, Sept. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- It's a perfect case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend.

A potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer, a small, preliminary study reports.

The bacteria, Clostridium novyi-NT, can cause gas gangrene and sepsis if infection is allowed to run amok in a wound.

But when injected into a tumor, Clostridium novyi-NT appears to both attack the cancer directly and encourage the body's immune response against the cancer cells, said lead researcher Dr. Filip Janku. He is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.

""Patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria, but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and, in some patients, clinically meaningful activity,"" Janku said.

Clostridium novyi has been linked to human illness. In 2000, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the United Kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria.

The strain used in this clinical trial, Clostridium novyi-NT, had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin, which can be lethal in humans, Janku said. The NT stands for ""non-toxic.""

Clostridium novyi flourishes in low-oxygen environments. Researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting, by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site.

""Normal tissues, even if they are low on oxygen, they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate,"" Janku explained. ""Cancerous tissue is low in oxygen, most often in the center of the cancers.""

To test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer, researchers injected the tumors of 24 patients with a single dose of Clostridium novyi-NT, ranging from 10,000 to 3 million spores.

Fifteen of the patients had sarcoma, two patients had melanoma, and seven had a variety of cancers, the researchers said.

The scientists expected Clostridium novyi-NT to help fight the tumor in two ways.

First, the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells, Janku said.

""If that happens, it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor-specific antigens, which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system,"" Janku said. ""It can prime the immune system to attack the cancer.""

The bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn't kill off tumor cells, Janku added.

Patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week, and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said.

""Clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics,"" Janku noted.

The bacteria germinated in the cancers of 11 out of the 24 patients, with tumor cells dying off as a result.

Tumor shrinkage of greater than 10 percent was observed in 23 percent of patients. However, Janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed, making the lesion appear larger than it actually is.

Following bacterial therapy, cancer stabilized in 21 patients. When both injected and uninjected lesions were included, the stable disease rate was 86 percent, the researchers reported.

The potential for Clostridium novyi-NT to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing, said Sacha Gnjatic, who is associate director of the Human Immune Monitoring Center at Mount Sinai in New York City.

""That's where the promise of this type of therapy lies. You would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you're disrupting the tumor cells,"" Gnjatic said. ""What would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non-injected tumors. That's the holy grail of immunotherapy.""

Janku said he's particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas, which are cancers that occur in bone, muscle and soft tissues.

""Classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn't seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas,"" Janku explained.

Researchers have moved on to the next phase, in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab (Keytruda) will also be treated with a single injection of Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku said. The researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers.

However, they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from Clostridium novyi-NT, Janku added.

Two patients treated with the heaviest dose of 3 million spores of Clostridium novyi-NT fell ill with sepsis and/or gas gangrene, leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at 1 million spores.

Researchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients, meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked, Janku said.

""That didn't result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region, but it's a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients,"" Janku said.

Patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects, such as low blood pressure or fever, he added.

The trial results were to be presented Sunday at the International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference, in New York City. The meeting is jointly sponsored by the Cancer Research Institute, the Association for Cancer Immunotherapy, the European Academy of Tumor Immunology, and the American Association for Cancer Research.

Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"(Reuters Health) - People struggling with irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) might feel better with antidepressants or psychotherapy, a recent study suggests.

People with IBS typically suffer from chronic abdominal pain, gas, diarrhea and constipation. While some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms, this approach doesn’t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain.

For the current analysis, researchers examined data from 53 trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy, either alone or in combination, versus placebo treatments or “usual management” in people with IBS.

Rates of “no relief” were highest with placebo treatments. People were 34 percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and 31 percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy, the study found.

“One component of IBS is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels; simply summarized, this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel, or both,” said Dr. Michael Camilleri, a researcher at the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine and Science in Rochester, Minnesota, who wasn’t involved in the current study.

“Since there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity, some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels,” Camilleri said by email.

Psychiatric conditions including depression, anxiety, and somatisation - physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins - are common among people with IBS, researchers note in the American Journal of Gastroenterology.

Although the use of antidepressants is common among IBS patients, psychotherapy is not, the study authors note.

One limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment, researchers note. Another drawback is that these studies weren’t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve IBS symptoms.

Still, a psychological evaluation may make sense for IBS patients because it’s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression, said Dr. Agnieszka Kulak-Bejda, a psychiatry researcher at the Medical University of Białystok in Poland who wasn’t involved in the study.

Antidepressants may work better for certain types of IBS, and the study findings also suggest that the type of medication may matter, Kulak-Bejda said by email.

A family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of IBS, the analysis found. But another family of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) was better than a placebo for easing symptoms like pain and bloating and improving quality of life.

“The decision to use antidepressants as a form of therapy should be taken individually,” Kulak-Bejda said. “The decision should be made after considering all the pros and cons.”

Lead author Dr. Alexander Ford of the University of Leeds in the U.K. didn’t respond to requests for comment.

"The enlarged organ tugs apart the mitral valve, which controls blood flow from the left atrium into the left ventricle. The distorted valve functions poorly, its flaps swinging apart. Blood that is supposed to be pumped into the body backs up into the heart and lungs.

A vicious cycle ensues: The heart enlarges, so the mitral valve leaks. The leaky mitral valve makes the heart enlarge even more, as it tries to compensate, and heart failure worsens.

In the new study, a device called the MitraClip was used to repair the mitral valve by clipping its two flaps together in the middle. (The clip is made by Abbott, which funded the study; outside experts reviewed the trial data.)

The result was to convert a valve that barely functioned into one able to regulate blood flow in and out of the heart.

Until today, researchers were not sure that fixing the mitral valve would do much to help these patients. A smaller study in France with similar patients failed to find a benefit for the MitraClip.

But that research included many patients with less severe valve problems, the procedure was not performed as adeptly, and the patients’ medications were not as well optimized as in the new study.

In the new trial, 614 patients with severe heart failure in the United States and Canada were randomly assigned to receive a MitraClip along with standard medical treatment or to continue with standard care alone.",1
"In an article on Popular Science’s website, Jay writes about her experience with pain and the next-generation way she’s finding relief.

She is hardly alone in her suffering. According to the National Center for Health Statistics, an estimated 25.3 million Americans, or 11.2 percent of U.S. adults, experience chronic pain. It can interfere with work and home life and leave patients debilitated, disabled and depressed. So it makes sense that Jay jumped at the chance to experience long-term pain relief with the help of a spinal-cord stimulator.

Jay lays out the hows and whys of spinal stimulation, and she paints a vivid picture of a life in agony, a journey that has included skeptical doctors, plenty of painkillers and unanswered questions about the future.

She also describes her path to spinal stimulation, how the device works with the body to short-circuit pain, and the many roadblocks to relief that patients face.

“Even for me, the battle is not over,” Jay writes. “Since this surgery I’ve actually had another disc herniate, complicating everything. My spine isn’t cured, and I still hurt all the time. But the pain is far more controlled, and I can function much better at my current level of discomfort.”

As the human and financial costs of the opioid crisis rise, spinal stimulation may become more popular, even though it’s expensive. Jay says she was lucky: Her insurance covered much of the six-figure bill for the procedure.

"Medical marijuana can provide relief from symptoms from dozens of health conditions with minimal negative side effects, according to new research.

Two studies published recently in the journals Frontiers in Pharmacology and Medicine found that patients with health conditions such as chronic pain and insomnia saw ""statistically and clinically significant therapeutic benefits"" when they used medical cannabis, according to a press release from the University of New Mexico.

Researchers from the university studied data obtained through the Releaf App. This app, developed by several of the studies' authors, is ""the largest repository of user-entered information on the consumption and effect of cannabis use in the United States,"" the release states. It has almost 100,000 entries.

The app is designed to record how using marijuana corresponds to changes in the intensity of symptoms and any side effects a person experiences. It helps ""track and learn which types of cannabis, dosing and ingestion methods work best.""

The study published in Frontiers in Pharmacology found that users suffering from 27 different health conditions with symptoms ranging from seizures to depression reported a mean reduction in symptoms of 2.8 to 4.6 points on a zero to 10 point scale after consuming cannabis in various forms, including concentrates and topicals. People using the drug to treat anxiety- and depression-related symptoms reported more relief than people with pain symptoms.

In the second study, researchers examined how cannabis buds treated insomnia. Cannabis users on the Releaf App experienced a reduction of symptom severity of an average 4.5 points on a zero to 10 point scale. According to the study, people who consumed the drug via pipes and vaporizers experienced greater relief of symptoms, and those who vaped experienced fewer negative effects.

According to the release, data from the app showed that an overall 94 percent of cannabis users suffering from a variety of health conditions reported that the intensity of their symptoms was reduced after consuming the drug. Additionally, use of marijuana was associated with non-serious side effects.

""If the results found in our studies can be extrapolated to the general population, cannabis could systematically replace multi-billion dollar medication industries around the world. It is likely already beginning to do so,"" Jacob Vigil, co-author of the studies, said in the release.",1

"One single dose of cannabidiol, a chemical extracted from cannabis, decreases brain abnormalities in people with psychosis.

According to a study published Wednesday by King's College London in JAMA Psychiatry, cannidiboil, also referred to as CBD, acts in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms. The chemical is a non-intoxicating compound found in cannabis.

Researchers examined participants who were experiencing psychotic symptoms, but had not yet been diagnosed with psychosis, as well as healthy patients. Some subjects with symptoms were given placebo, while others received a single dose of CBD. All the participants then underwent an MRI scan while performing a memory task that engages regions of the brain related to psychosis, a press release stated.

Results from the MRI scans showed that participants displaying psychotic symptoms had abnormal brain activity compared to healthy participants. However, those that had received cannabidiol showed decreased abnormal activity compared to those who received the placebo. These results suggest that CBD can help re-adjust brain function to normal levels.

The researchers aren't entirely sure how CBD works in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms, but the results show that it has a therapeutic effect, according to the press release.

""The mainstay of current treatment for people with psychosis are drugs that were first discovered in the 1950s and unfortunately do not work for everyone,"" Sagnik Bhattacharyya, co-author of the study said in the release. ""Our results have started unravelling the brain mechanisms of a new drug that works in a completely different way to traditional antipsychotics.""

A previous King's College London study also discovered that the chemical has antipsychotic effects, and in June, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first medication made from cannabidiol to treat two rare forms of epilepsy.",1
"“Let’s talk about your test results,” my neurologist said.

She looked as if she had good news. Instead, it was shocking.

The carotid artery on the left side of my neck, one of the brain’s two main sources of blood and oxygen, was clogged with fatty plaque, the doctor said. The artery was almost completely blocked.

There must be a mistake, I thought frantically. I exercise and am healthy and young. Actually, I’m 68, but, you know, a young 68. You are in danger of a major stroke, she said, and need an operation. Immediately.

The irony wasn’t lost on me. As a journalist covering the medical field, I have spent years writing about strokes, most of which are caused by clots blocking blood flow to the brain. Now I faced the unnerving question: Am I going to become a weird punch line? As in: Did you see that the guy who writes all those stories about strokes just had a big one?

A blocked carotid artery didn’t seem possible for an active person like me. I’ve never smoked. I’ve run, lifted weights or done something aerobic like playing tennis pretty much every day of my life. I watch what I eat. I even wrote an article about how I kept my bad cholesterol in check with diet and exercise, not medication.

While I’m addicted to cheese, and my weight has climbed some, I’ve eaten foods like salmon and oatmeal with fervor for more than 20 years. So I figured I was exempt from medical crises.

The diagnosis made me reconsider dilemmas that had once seemed academic. For example, should older Americans be screened for blocked carotid arteries?

Critical Paths The carotid arteries are passageways through which blood and oxygen move to a person's brain and face. When fatty plaque obstructs an artery, the blood supply can be reduced or cut off, sometimes resulting in a stroke.

External carotid arteries supply blood to face and neck 2. Internal carotid arteries supply blood to brain 1 1 2 2 DETAIL Internal External Blockage caused by fatty plaque Blood flow Common carotid artery

Clots cause about 700,000 strokes that lead to 130,000 deaths annually in the U.S. and are the primary preventable cause of disability, according to the American Stroke Association. Carotid disease is a main cause of those strokes—nearly 200,000 strokes a year, vascular specialists say. Yet 80% of those patients have no symptoms before the strokes.

In 2014, a U.S. task force concluded that people with no symptoms don’t have to be screened for carotid disease, saying that the risks, such as poor surgery, “outweigh the benefits.” But the task force—a panel of private doctors assigned by law to help set U.S. medical policy—focused on screening in the general population, not older patients.

The task force said there aren’t enough carotid-caused strokes to warrant screening everyone. Of course, not everyone with carotid blockage will get surgery; thousands of people with the condition can benefit from drug therapy.

My experience, along with some evidence from screening of thousands of individuals, raises questions about the task force’s conclusions. The Society for Vascular Surgery recommends screening people over 65 with coronary disease, high blood pressure or a history of smoking.

The task force generally supports screening Americans for breast cancer, with 253,000 new cases in women and 41,000 estimated deaths annually, as well as colorectal cancer, with 135,000 new cases and 50,000 deaths a year. Government and private insurance pay to screen for these illnesses, but not for carotid screening of non-symptomatic people, which can cost about $70 a person.

After hearing the jarring news about my dangerously blocked carotid, I faced a big decision. My wife Christa and I live near Washington, D.C. Our daughter, Maddie, was supposed to be married in San Francisco in June, a week after the neurologist told me I needed surgery right away. Suddenly the prospect of being at the wedding seemed iffy.

Conventional wisdom says that among the 65-and-older set, only those with symptoms should be tested. That often means individuals who have had mini-strokes, which tend to be brief periods in which the patient has something wrong on one side of the body, usually for a few minutes. Symptoms often include slurred speech, temporary vision loss, a one-sided facial droop and arm or leg weakness or numbness.

Vascular surgeon George Lavenson Jr. wrote in 2012 in the Journal for Vascular Ultrasound that among 22,146 people screened for carotid disease during four public screening campaigns between 2001 and 2006, about 7.5% were found to have blockage of 60% or more—enough to warrant treatment with medication.

“It is hard to understand how many leaders in the medical profession can object to a one- to two-minute accurate screen of seniors that can find the 7.5% with silent carotid artery disease,” Dr. Lavenson said. Those patients can be “evaluated and managed to prevent them from being one of the 700,000 clot-caused strokes we continue to have annually.”

Most doctors would have put me in the asymptomatic, or less-risky, category. But five years ago, I went out for a run of about 7 miles along the Potomac River. At the end of the run, my right leg started shaking. That seldom happened again until the past few months, when it started recurring more often, along with shaking in the right arm.

My physician, Joel Taubin, recommended a neurologist, Rhanni Herzfeld, of the Neurology Center in Washington. She prescribed tests to discern the cause of the shaking, perhaps a pinched nerve, incipient epilepsy, a neurological disorder or a tumor. The results ruled them all out.

Then an MRI of my head showed a few white spots on the left side. Dr. Herzfeld wondered if I might have had some “silent strokes,” sending tiny bits of artery plaque floating to my brain—and now appearing as white spots on the scan. Fatty plaque accumulates in most people’s arteries, and can form clots that break off and can cause strokes.

Dr. Herzfeld ordered a carotid ultrasound of the arteries on both sides of my neck. It’s a quick, painless and very accurate scan. Moments later, we were talking in her office. My right carotid artery was perfectly clear, she said. The left was almost completely blocked and I needed immediate surgery to clear it.

I asked if we could treat the obstruction with anti-platelet medication, such as Plavix.

“No, your blockage is just too extensive,” Dr. Herzfeld said. She recommended that Bruce A. Perler, a professor of vascular surgery at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, do the procedure.

The effectiveness of carotid-artery surgery in people without symptoms—but major blockage—was established two decades ago by the Asymptomatic Carotid Artery Stenosis trial, funded by the National Institutes of Health. It showed, in hospitals in the U.S. and Canada, that the risk of stroke or death in surgery patients after a median 2.7 years was 5.1%, less than half that of people treated only with drugs. An international study published in 2010 in the Lancet showed similar benefits from surgery.

I consulted with other doctors, including one who said, “This isn’t quite an emergency, but it’s urgent.”

The operation is serious, with the rates of stroke and death within 30 days after surgery totaling about 2.4% in major studies examined by the task force. The task force noted that this typical measure can be as high as 5% at some low-volume hospitals.

People considering this operation should ask their hospital, surgeon or academic medical center about their rates of stroke and death after surgery. Few hospitals and surgeons in the U.S. publish their individual results. Dr. Perler’s rate was well under 1%. He said my risk of stroke was 10% to 15% over five years, probably in the first year.

A week before Maddie’s wedding, my wife and I met with Dr. Perler at Johns Hopkins. On the drive to Baltimore, we called Maddie. She sounded frightened and I told her maybe I wouldn’t need surgery—or could put it off. We also told her brothers, Jamie and Will, and her sister, Samantha, what was going on.

Dr. Perler’s test confirmed Dr. Herzfeld’s findings: I definitely needed surgery. My artery was almost completely obstructed by “echolucent” plaque—a type that can easily form clots, break off and cause strokes.

We discussed timing. Dr. Perler’s next surgery day was June 18. That would leave me four days to recover before the wedding. He warned that I would be “miserable” doing that. But his next surgery day after that wasn’t until June 27.

“You can safely wait until next week,” he said, “but I wouldn’t wait two months.” Then he added the words I remember most: “We’ll take good care of you.”

My wife and I decided on June 27—and headed to San Francisco for the wedding. It was an untraditional ceremony with no white veil or a parade of bridesmaids. Maddie wore a champagne-colored, beaded dress. I have never seen her so happy—except maybe when she was playing My Little Pony as a 6-year-old. I was simply happy to be there.

On the morning of June 27, Dr. Perler started operating at 7:30. Within two hours, he had cleared the plaque from my carotid artery. Later, he told me it was so clogged—about 99%—he couldn’t even detect a pulse in it.

When I woke up, I was relieved to see that my eyes and fingers all worked. I could think and speak clearly. I was even able to complain to the nurses about how lousy I felt.

I spent two days in intensive care, with my blood pressure surging at times. About two weeks after the operation, I felt pretty normal. I’ve resumed running and weight-lifting. I recently played golf for the first time since the surgery and feel great.

But mostly I feel lucky to have gotten a test that may have saved my life.

Getting Screened A national company, Life Line Screening, will do a carotid screen for $70, or with other tests such as for aortic aneurysms, for $149.

Hospitals’ accredited labs will do carotid ultrasound tests typically for $200 to $300, but usually only on a doctor’s order.

Insurers, private and government, generally will pay only if the patient has symptoms, including a mini-stroke.

The Society for Vascular Surgery’s site, vascular.org, can direct people to specialists who can do testing.

"TMS treats conditions by delivering brief, powerful magnetic field pulses that stimulate nerve cells in the brain. The procedure is noninvasive and doesn't require anesthesia, and the pulses are delivered via an electromagnetic device or coil that is placed or worn on the head.

The Food and Drug Administration made the announcement on Friday, expanding the use of a technology that has been around for decades. The FDA first approved TMS devices for major depression in 2008, and in 2013 they were approved to treat pain associated with some types of migraine headaches.

The approval was based on a clinical trial of 100 people with obsessive-compulsive disorder, where roughly half received treatment with TMS and the other half had a sham treatment that didn't deliver the electromagnetic pulses. People who were taking medication for OCD continued to do so for the trial.

Overall, 38% of the people with the real device responded to the treatment compared with 11% of those with the sham device. A response was considered a 30% reduction in the Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (YBOCS) score, which is used to measure the severity of OCD symptoms.",1

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For women with advanced breast cancer who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, an experimental drug could improve survival, a new study suggests.

The BRCA mutations are linked with a greater risk for aggressive breast and ovarian cancer. The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones.

In a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug's maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found.

""For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston.

When it's functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers.

PARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate.

In addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors ""to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,"" Litton said.

The trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

In January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer.

Similar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency.

In the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found.

The drug does have side effects. Among women receiving talazoparib, 55 percent had blood disorders, mostly anemia, compared with 38 percent of those receiving standard chemotherapy.

In addition, 32 percent of the women receiving talazoparib had other side effects, compared with 38 percent of those on standard chemotherapy.

Oncologist Dr. Marisa Weiss is the founder and chief medical officer of Breastcancer.org. ""Smart medicines like this PARP inhibitor work better than traditional chemo in women with HER2-negative metastatic disease and a BRCA1/2 genetic mutation,"" she said.

This targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study.

Normal cells are mostly spared. As a result, more cancer cells are killed with fewer side effects, Weiss said.

""Most importantly, patients themselves have reported a better experience with less hair loss and improved quality of life,"" she said.

Weiss advises women with advanced breast cancer to have genetic testing.

""In both my clinical practice and within the online support community, we advise women with metastatic breast cancer to get genetic testing upon diagnosis, in order to get the best care first,"" she said.

The trial was funded by drug maker Pfizer, and the results were published Aug. 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the first time ever has green-lighted a birth control app to be marketed as a method of contraception.

The app, Natural Cycles, calculates when a woman is most likely to be fertile using their daily body temperature data and their menstrual cycle information.

The app then tells users what days they are more likely to be fertile and should abstain from sex or use protection if they do not wish to get pregnant.

Natural Cycles

""Consumers are increasingly using digital health technologies to inform their everyday health decisions, and this new app can provide an effective method of contraception if it’s used carefully and correctly,"" Dr. Terri Cornelison, the assistant director for the health of women in the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health, said in a statement.

""But women should know that no form of contraception works perfectly, so an unplanned pregnancy could still result from correct usage of this device,"" she added.

The app had a ""perfect use"" failure rate of 1.8 percent in clinical studies that involved more than 15,500 women, or a ""typical use"" failure rate of 6.5 percent, according to the FDA. The ""typical use"" failure rate took into account women who sometimes did not use the app correctly or may have had unprotected sex on a day when the app flagged that they were fertile.

STOCK PHOTO/Getty Images

Natural Cycles has, however, courted controversy in Europe, as some women have reported unwanted pregnancies while using the app as their main form of birth control.

Sweden's public broadcasting company SVT reported that 37 out of 668 women who received an abortion at a Stockholm hospital from September 2017 to the end of December 2017 were using the app and still had an unwanted pregnancy.

ABC News' chief medical correspondent Dr. Jennifer Ashton emphasized that no method of contraception is perfect except abstinence, so it's not completely surprising that women have still gotten pregnant while using it.

Ashton added that apps can be useful in that they enourage women to be aware of their bodies' monthly changes. If a woman does decide to use an app for birth control, however, she needs to have a plan for what she would do if she does have an unplanned pregnancy.

Most contraception pills have a ""typical use"" failure rate of approximately 9 percent, according to Ashton, which is actually higher than the rate of the app, the FDA's data showed.

Still, Asthon says that women should ask their doctors about risks, benefits and alternatives for any contraceptive method they are using.",1

TUESDAY, Aug. 7, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Dialysis patients waiting for kidney transplants might safely accept an organ from a donor infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV), a new study finds.

Using hepatitis C-infected kidneys would expand the organ pool and save lives, said lead researcher Dr. Peter Reese. He's an associate professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia.

""There is a tremendous lack of kidneys for transplant,"" he explained. ""Because of the opioid crisis, there are many people who die from a drug overdose and have HCV and want to donate their organs.""

But these infected kidneys are discarded, even though they are otherwise healthy. And many are from younger people, Reese said.

Of roughly a half-million patients in the United States who were on dialysis for late-stage kidney disease in 2016, only 19,000 received kidney transplants. This is partly due to organ shortages, researchers have reported. And the average wait time for a non-infected kidney is more than two years, compared to eight months for an HCV-infected kidney.

New, less toxic treatments for hepatitis C opened the door for transplanting infected kidneys and then successfully treating the infection, Reese said.

In a study of 20 uninfected patients, researchers found that transplanting infected kidneys and then treating recipients for HCV resulted in a 100 percent cure rate. Half were evaluated six months after their transplant and the others a year after.

""And we found that these kidney transplants were working as well as kidney transplants from uninfected patients,"" Reese said.

The potential cost savings could be significant, he added. Dialysis can cost more than $88,000 a year, according to the U.S. National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases.

Though some patients might not want to take the risk associated with an infected kidney, others might consider it a good option, given the high death rates for dialysis patients awaiting transplants, the researchers suggested.

The report was published online Aug. 6 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

Dr. Adnan Sharif, a consultant transplant nephrologist at Queen Elizabeth Hospital and University of Birmingham in the United Kingdom, wrote an accompanying editorial.

Sharif said the excellent short-term outcomes and 100 percent cure rate of HCV in organ recipients should prompt transplant centers to rethink use of HCV-infected kidneys.

""We must be bold in our approach to utilizing HCV kidneys,"" he said.

Sharif acknowledged, however, that using HCV-infected kidneys would represent ""a significant shift in our attitude to risk, procurement of organs and counseling potential recipients appropriately about the risks -- albeit minimal.""

But the cost effectiveness of using these kidneys versus remaining on dialysis would be significant, he noted.

Another study, published in the same journal in July, reported similar success in transplants of HCV-infected kidneys into HCV-infected patients. About 15 percent of dialysis patients have HCV, the researchers said.

Sharif said other organs from HCV-infected donors, such as hearts and lungs, might also be safely transplanted, expanding those organs' supply, as well.

""Using such donors could lead to many life-saving or enhancing transplants,"" he said.

"Worried About Dementia? You Might Want to Check Your Blood Pressure

Enlarge this image toggle caption John Rensten/Getty Images John Rensten/Getty Images

Every day, Dr. Walter Koroshetz, 65, takes a pill as part of his effort to help keep his brain healthy and sharp.

The pill is his blood pressure medication. And Koroshetz, who directs the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, says controlling high blood pressure helps him reduce his risk of dementia.

He also keeps his blood pressure down by exercising and paying attention to his weight and diet. ""I'm a believer,"" he says.

Koroshetz is urging other people with high blood pressure to follow his lead.

He is responsible for the institute's public health campaign called Mind Your Risks. Its goal is to let people know that there is a link between high blood pressure, stroke and dementia.

When blood pressure rises, it strains the tiny blood vessels that keep brain cells alive, Koroshetz says.

""With every pulse of your heart, you are pushing blood into these very small blood vessels in the brain,"" he says. And when the heart pushes too hard, as it does when blood pressure is elevated, it can cause damage that can lead to a stroke.

At least two large studies have revealed an alarming trend among stroke patients, Koroshetz says.

""If you had a stroke, even a small stroke, your risk of dementia within the next two years was greatly magnified,"" he says. ""So there's something about having a stroke that drives a lot of the processes that give rise to dementia.""

The evidence is clearest for a type of dementia called vascular dementia. It occurs when something blocks or reduces the flow of blood to brain cells.

But high blood pressure also appears to increase a person's risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, which is associated with the accumulation of plaques and tangles in the brain.

If people knew about the link between dementia and high blood pressure, they might be more inclined to do something about it, Koroshetz says.

""Only about 50 percent of people who have hypertension are actually treated,"" he says. ""So I think there's a lot to be said for trying to get high blood pressure under control.""

Koroshetz's campaign is getting some help from the Alzheimer's Association.

The group will present new research on blood pressure and Alzheimer's at its annual scientific meeting in Chicago, which starts July 22. And the group is encouraging people to control high blood pressure.

""The good news is that we can control blood pressure now,"" says Maria Carrillo, the group's chief science officer. ""We can do that with exercise, with lifestyle, with healthy eating and also with medications.""

Koroshetz is using all of these approaches. And he says other people with high blood pressure should follow his lead.

""When you get to be my age, you're going to be very grateful that you controlled your blood pressure and exercised,"" he says.",1
"A Simple Emergency Room Intervention Can Help Cut Suicide Risk

Enlarge this image toggle caption FangXiaNuo/Getty Images FangXiaNuo/Getty Images

Many people who attempt suicide end up in an emergency room for immediate treatment. But few of those suicide survivors get the follow-up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again.

Now, a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts. The intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge.

""It reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half,"" says Barbara Stanley, a psychologist at Columbia University and the lead author of the study. ""That's a phenomenal difference.""

The study, which was published Wednesday in JAMA Psychiatry, included 1,200 patients at five Veterans Affairs hospitals around the country. The findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country.

You Are Not Alone If you or someone you know may be considering suicide, contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 (en Español: 1-888-628-9454; deaf and hard of hearing: 1-800-799-4889) or the Crisis Text Line by texting 741741.

""When someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt, they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months,"" says Stanley. ""It's like a ticking time bomb.""

This is the first large-scale study of the Safety Planning Intervention, which Stanley and her group developed in 2008 and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country. It can be provided by a physician, a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training.

""The interesting thing about the Safety Planning Intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different [health care] settings,"" says Brian Ahmedani, director of behavioral health research at the Henry Ford Health System in Detroit, who wasn't involved in the new study.

Many health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide, he says. That's because, as his own work has shown, almost 83 percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death. Yet only 50 percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness.

The intervention studied by Stanley and her group starts in the ER or a clinic, before the suicidal patient is released. First, a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person's warning signs for a suicide attempt.

""If they've grappled with being suicidal, they know what their warning signs are,"" says Stanley. For example, she says, someone might say, "" 'I find that I'm staying in my room, not answering the phone, not answering texts, not answering emails.' That could be a warning sign."" Others might have repeated thoughts that they're not worthy.

The next step is for the patient — with help from the clinician — to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation.

For most people, this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours, she says.

The coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games, watching TV or talking to a loved one.

If people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing, they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them, notes Stanley. ""For suicidal people, the passage of time is their friend,"" she says.

The provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide. For example, if they own a gun, they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them. ""If you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use, time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside,"" she says.

Safety planning includes follow-up phone calls with the patient — the first call is made within 72 hours of being discharged from the ER. The provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed. The provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long-term care. A provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor.

That follow-up is key, says Julie Goldstein Grumet, a psychologist at the Zero Suicide Institute at the Education Development Center, a Washington, D.C.-based nonprofit.

""People often fall off and they don't follow up on their referrals,"" she says. ""And the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides.""

To evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention, Stanley's team looked at five VA emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four VA emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them.

Among the nearly 1,200 people who received the intervention, half as many people had made suicide attempts (or had come very close) as those in the control group. In other words, the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge. Two-thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans, and they were also twice as likely to get follow-up mental health treatment when compared with the control group.

""The study is incredibly important ... because it shows brief interventions work,"" says Goldstein Grumet.

Rick, a father in Missouri, says a safety plan may have saved his 12-year-old daughter's life. (NPR is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter's privacy.)

In September 2017, she came very close to taking her own life. When he found out about this from her school principal the next day, Rick rushed her to the ER at Mercy Hospital Jefferson. ""The whole process was overwhelming, because you have your 12-year-old who's wanting to end her life,"" Rick says. ""And she'd not shared any of that with us.""

The hospital wasn't part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides.

""The crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with,"" he says.

He says his daughter didn't want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles, but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways. During times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back, she agreed to watch TV with her mother or call or text her father.

Rick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day. And he responds by distracting her with something completely different.

He says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated.

""It was something that she could follow through with,"" he says. ""It gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence.""

He says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents.

""That's what is so powerful about a safety plan,"" says Ahmedani. ""The patient is the author of their safety plan, but it's guided by a provider.""

As part of the 2012 National Strategy For Suicide Prevention, many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the Zero Suicide Initiative, which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works.

While safety planning has begun to be used across the country, it ought to be adopted universally, says Goldstein Grumet.

""It is a brief intervention that hospital workers, primary care staff, outpatient behavioral health, can all be trained in to utilize,"" she says.",1
"(Reuters Health) - Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in older people, suggests a U.S. study.

The results suggest that vision fixes, like a new eyeglass prescription or surgery to remove cataracts, can go a long way toward helping older people stay mentally sharp, said lead author D. Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

“Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,” she said in a telephone interview.

Poor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology.

To investigate, Zheng’s team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year.

Over the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person’s vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger.

While the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn’t well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people.

She recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly.

“This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,” said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn’t involved in the research.

“If you’re aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,” she said in a phone interview.

The good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration “are highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they’re detected early.”

"Epidiolex was approved for patients age 2 and older who suffer from Lennox-Gastaut and Dravet syndromes. Both cause uncontrolled daily seizures and put patients at high risk for other physical and intellectual disabilities, injury and early death.

AD

The disorders afflict fewer than 45,000 people in the United States, but experts expect Epidiolex to be prescribed for other types of epilepsy as well. The drug is the first treatment approved for Dravet syndrome.

AD

FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said the approval was “a reminder that advancing sound development programs that properly evaluate active ingredients contained in marijuana can lead to important medical therapies.” The medication, tested in three randomized, placebo-controlled trials with more than 500 patients, was effective in reducing seizures, the FDA said.

Gottlieb noted that the action was “not an approval of marijuana or all of its components” but rather of one specific CBD medication for a particular use.

AD

The agency, he added, remains concerned about “the proliferation and illegal marketing of unapproved CBD-containing products with unproven medical claims.”

In April, an advisory committee unanimously recommended approval of the drug for the two types of epilepsy.

The FDA previously cleared medications containing synthetic versions of THC for nausea for patients getting chemotherapy and for other uses, but it had not approved any drug derived from the plant itself. Marijuana and its components, including CBD, are Schedule 1 controlled substances — meaning they are banned because they are thought to have a high abuse potential, no medical value and serious safety implications.

AD

AD

Now that Epidiolex is approved by the FDA, cannabidiol is expected to be reclassified by the Drug Enforcement Administration within 90 days. However, it isn’t clear whether such a reclassification would involve CBD products in general, the CBD formulation used specifically in Epidiolex or something else.

For those who have long argued that cannabis offers medical benefits, the FDA approval represents a milestone, “a recognition that the plant is a rich source of compounds which have potential therapeutic activity,” Justin Gover, chief executive of GW Pharmaceuticals, the London-based company that developed the drug, said in an interview last week. “We are just scratching the surface of what could be a range of cannabis-based medications.”

The medication, which will continue to be manufactured in Britain, will be marketed by Greenwich Biosciences, the U.S. subsidiary of GW Pharmaceuticals. The drugmaker is testing other CBD treatments for glioblastoma and schizophrenia.

AD

Shlomo Shinnar, president of the American Epilepsy Society and a neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in New York, has said the drug will be “a very valuable addition” to the limited options for treating severe childhood-onset epilepsy. Shinnar said he will welcome approval of a medicine that had undergone stringent FDA review for safety and effectiveness.

Many parents already are giving children unregulated CBD formulations that are available in medical marijuana dispensaries in the many states where such operations are legal. Some have said that they have no intention of switching to the new prescription CBD drug because the products they're using are helping their children. Others said they are anxious to try an FDA-approved product.

TUESDAY, June 19, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that a single blood test could confirm type 2 diabetes, saving patients time and health care costs.

Currently, it's recommended that a blood test focused on elevated fasting levels of blood sugar (glucose) or a blood component called glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c) be confirmed with a second blood test at a follow-up visit.

But taking the test twice takes up time and money and could still result in missed diagnoses, said a team from the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health in Baltimore.

In the new study, researchers led by Hopkins epidemiologist Elizabeth Selvin looked at data on more than 13,000 people in a long-running U.S. heart disease study. The study began in the 1980s, and along the way has recorded valuable data from participants, including diabetes test data.

Selvin's group analyzed that data, and reported that a positive result for glucose and HbA1c from just a single blood sample can confirm type 2 diabetes.

This could change care, ""potentially allowing a major simplification of current clinical practice guidelines,"" Selvin said in a university news release. ""Doctors are already doing these [glucose and HbA1c] tests together -- if a patient is obese, for example, and has other risk factors for diabetes, the physician is likely to order tests for both glucose and HbA1c from a single blood sample.

""It's just that the guidelines don't clearly let you use the tests from that one blood sample to make the initial diabetes diagnosis,"" she explained.

Diabetes is treatable, but about 3 million Americans with the disease don't know they have it.

""I'm hoping that these results will lead to a change in the clinical guidelines when they are revised in early 2019, which could make identifying diabetes a lot more efficient in many cases,"" Selvin said.

Diabetes experts welcomed the findings.

""Diabetes moves fast, and the cost of diabetes has increased more than 20 percent since 2012,"" noted Dr. Robert Courgi. The new study ""helps us move quicker to treat diabetes,"" he said.

""By diagnosing diabetes quicker, we can improve outcomes,"" said Courgi, an endocrinologist at Northwell Health's Southside Hospital in Bay Shore, N.Y. ""The current standard is to delay diagnosis with repeat office visits and blood work. Now we can educate the patient sooner and start treatment earlier to prevent complications of diabetes such as heart attack, dialysis and amputations.""

Dr. Gerald Bernstein coordinates the Friedman Diabetes Program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He agreed that quicker diagnosis could mean better treatment and outcomes for patients.

""The CDC reports that greater than 52 percent of the U.S. population has either clinical diabetes or prediabetes,"" Bernstein noted. ""Given these numbers, any abnormality of glucose should be regarded as sufficient reason to start preventative treatment with an education program, lifestyle change and first-line medication such as metformin.""

According to Bernstein, if only one diagnostic test were needed, ""this would mean that a follow-up visit would be a look at the treatment benefits -- rather than a confirmation of an abnormal glucose.""

The study was published June 19 in the journal Annals of Internal Medicine.

"(Reuters Health) - A system of automated twice-daily texts and the ability to use text messaging to receive answers to questions about treatment helps relieve some of the stress of chemotherapy for women with breast cancer, researchers at the Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia reported Monday.

The feasibility study was designed to see if texting could relieve some of the anxiety that comes with the fatigue, hair loss and other body changes that can accompany anticancer drugs.

Compared to 52 women who only received an American Cancer Society pamphlet on chemotherapy, the 48 women in the texting group reported an overall lower level of distress and a higher quality of life during their therapy. They also felt they had better communication with their doctors.

The text messages were most effective at reducing distress at the 2- and 4-month marks, according to the data presented by chief author Kuang-Yi Wen, an assistant professor in the Cancer Prevention and Control program at Fox Chase. At the fourth month mark, “the gap was huge” between the texting and control groups, she told Reuters Health in a telephone interview.

Texting also played a role in helping patients feel like they were in control of their treatment, particularly during the first month.

Texting did not affect the odds of developing symptoms of depression.

Surprisingly, the older the patient, the greater the likelihood that she would text back, seeking more information.

One of the patients texted the program 1,217 times. “That’s what’s good about this program. Everyone has different information-seeking behavior” and the system can respond to that, Dr. Wen said.

The findings were released at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in Chicago.

"From Chaos To Calm: A Life Changed By Ketamine

Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR

For six years now, life has been really good for James. He has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in New York City. He enjoys spending time with his wife and kids.

And it has all been possible, he says, because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine.

Before ketamine, James was unable to work or focus his thoughts. His mind was filled with violent images. And his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes.

Ketamine ""helped me get my life back,"" says James, who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career.

Ketamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the 1960s. And almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind-bending party drug.

But ketamine's story took a surprising turn in 2006, when researchers at the National Institutes of Health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours. Since then, doctors have prescribed ketamine ""off label"" to thousands of depressed patients who don't respond to other drugs.

And pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine-related drugs to treat depression. Johnson & Johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year, though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting.

Meanwhile, doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression. And there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety, bipolar disorder, post-traumatic stress disorder, and perhaps even obsessive-compulsive disorder.

""I think it's actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time,"" says Dr. Martin Teicher, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and director of the Developmental Biopsychiatry Research Program at McLean Hospital.

Ketamine may also offer new hope for people like James who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders.

James had a happy childhood, he says. But his thoughts were out of control. ""I always felt like I was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me,"" he says.

He spent much of his childhood terrified of ""an unknown, an ambiguous force out there."" The fear was ""overwhelming,"" he says. ""I literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until I went to college.""

And there was something else about James: his body temperature.

""I overheated constantly,"" he says. ""I would wear shorts all year long. In my 20s in my apartment I would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter.""

In his late 20s, James saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. So he started taking stimulants.

At first, the pills helped him focus. Then they didn't, no matter how many he took.

He'd done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry. But now James was trying to work at home, and it wasn't going well.

""ADHD pills will make you interested in anything,"" he says. ""So I was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart. I was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart. I was going in a massive downward spiral.""

James had always suffered from mood swings. But now they were rapid and extreme. And he couldn't stop thinking about gruesome scenarios, like a murderer coming for his family.

""My wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me,"" he says. ""She would go to work for a few hours, then rush home. There would be times I'd call her just screaming, 'Please come home. I can't get through another minute.' ""

Eventually, James found his way to Dr. Demitri Papolos, an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at Albert Einstein College of Medicine.

""He was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office,"" Papolos says. ""He was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat.""

Papolos diagnosed James with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the ""fear of harm phenotype."" It typically appears in childhood and often doesn't respond to traditional psychiatric drugs.

But Papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine. ""It's been transformational,"" he says.

In January, Papolos published a study of 45 children with the problem. They inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week. Nearly all got dramatically better.

Scientists still aren't sure why ketamine works, but there's evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire, to alter the connections between cells. That process has been linked to recovery from depression. And it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders.

""I think it's having multiple effects, and that means it's probably useful for multiple different disorders,"" Teicher says.

One of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation. And that could explain why patients like James usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine.

James started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day. He says his response was dramatic.

""One day I turn to my wife and I'm like, 'I feel calm today. I don't know if it's the sun coming in, I don't know if it's just the way we're sitting here, but I feel like I could go and sit at the computer and work.' ""

The next day, James did sit down at his computer. A month later, he was back at work.",0
"A blood test for 10 different types of cancers could one day help doctors screen for the disease before patients show symptoms, researchers at the world’s largest gathering of oncologists have said.

The test, called a liquid biopsy, screens for cancer by detecting tiny bits of DNA released by cancer cells into blood. The test had particularly good results for ovarian and pancreatic cancers, though the number of cancers detected was small.

Researchers hope the test will become part of a “universal screening” tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients.

“This is potentially the holy grail of cancer research, to find cancers that are currently hard to cure at an earlier stage when they are easier to cure,” said Dr Eric Klein, lead author of the research from Cleveland Clinic’s Taussig Cancer Institute. “We hope this test could save many lives.”

The study, by a research team that also included scientists from Stanford University, was presented at the annual conference of the American Society of Clinical Oncologists in Chicago.

Simon Stevens, the chief executive of NHS England, said “new techniques” such as cancer blood tests could “unlock enormous survival gains, as well as dramatic productivity benefits in the practice of medicine”.

“Now, as the NHS marks its 70th anniversary, we stand on the cusp of a new era of personalised medicine that will dramatically transform care for cancer and for inherited and rare diseases,” said Stevens.

The research scrutinised the cases of more than 1,600 people, 749 of whom were cancer-free at the time of the study, with no diagnosis, and 878 of whom had been newly diagnosed with a disease.

The test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic, ovarian, liver and gallbladder cancers, correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients.

The blood test found lymphoma and myeloma with slightly less accuracy, at 77% and 73%, and bowel cancer in two out of three patients. Lung cancer was detected in 59% of patients. Head and neck cancer was detected in 56% of patients.

Researchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer, but noted further “clinical development” was needed.

The number of patients in whom cancers were detected was small. For example, although the test detected ovarian cancer with 90% accuracy, only 10 ovarian cancers in total were detected.

Nevertheless, researchers aim to develop a tool that could be used by for all people regardless of their family history. “Potentially this test could be used for everybody,” said Klein.

Prof Nicholas Turner from the Institute of Cancer Research in London described the findings as really exciting and as a possible universal screening tool. “Far too many cancers are picked up too late, when it is no longer possible to operate and the chances of survival are slim,” he said. “The goal is to develop a blood test, such as this one, that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages.”

Klein added: “It is several steps away and more research is needed, but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age, such as those over 40, to see if they have early signs of cancer.”",1
"THURSDAY, May 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Because vertigo can have many causes, treating it can be difficult, but researchers have identified a new type that may be effectively treated with medication.

""These conditions can be difficult to diagnose and quite debilitating for people, so it's exciting to be able to discover this new diagnosis of a condition that may respond to treatment,"" said Dr. Ji-Soo Kim, a researcher at Seoul National University in South Korea.

Vertigo -- episodes of dizziness that can last for minutes or days -- may be triggered by a number of health issues, ranging from an inner ear disorder to tumors. In some cases, the cause is unclear. Patients can also experience other uncomfortable symptoms, including vomiting, headaches and motion sickness.

For the study, researchers recruited 338 people who had vertigo with an unknown cause. Some had attacks rarely, maybe once a year. Others had them two to three times a week. Participants also developed nausea, headaches and could not tolerate head movements during the attacks.

To diagnose the new vertigo, the researchers had patients sit in a dark room. They then moved each patient's head forward and shook it from side to side for about 15 seconds.

Afterwards, a video recorded the patients' eye movements. The researchers noticed that uncontrolled eye movements, called nystagmus, lasted longer in people with this new form of vertigo.

The findings were published online May 23 in Neurology.

""It's possible that the vertigo occurs when this unstable mechanism is disrupted by factors either within the person's body or in their environment,"" Kim said in a journal news release.

This new form of the condition is called recurrent spontaneous vertigo with head-shaking nystagmus. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo.

They were compared to 35 others whose vertigo is triggered by other conditions, including the inner ear disorder Meniere's disease. Those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for 12 seconds -- twice as long as those with Meniere's and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis.

Those with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition, the study showed.

Preventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely.

The researchers followed the new vertigo patients for an average of 12 years. Five had no more attacks, 14 had an improvement in their condition, and only one person had a worsening of symptoms. The others' outcomes were not revealed.

(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday expanded the use of Novartis AG’s relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Gilenya to treat children and adolescents.

MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults.

Gilenya is the first FDA-approved drug to treat pediatric patients suffering from relapsing MS, the U.S. health regulator said.

In a clinical trial 86 percent of patients receiving Gilenya remained relapse-free after 24 months of treatment, compared to 46 percent of those who were administered another MS drug.

Gilenya was first approved by the FDA to treat adults with relapsing MS.",1
"Less invasive procedure, often for osteoarthritis, used in only 9% of cases, researchers find

Many more people facing surgery for knee problems would be better off with a partial rather than total knee replacement, which should allow them to recover faster, say experts.



Partial replacements are also cheaper, say researchers from Oxford University. The NHS, however, needs to get the support of surgeons, many of whom rarely carry out the less invasive procedure.

Knees, stretching and heel-striking: three running myths debunked Read more

Partial replacements, also known as unicompartmental replacements, are suitable for people who have arthritis in just one side of the knee, usually the inner. They can be carried out with a smaller incision using minimally invasive surgery, but they are only suitable for people whose ligaments inside the knee are strong.



Researchers from the Nuffield Department of Orthopaedics, Rheumatology and Musculoskeletal Sciences (NDORMS) publishing in the BMJ Open journal found that the less invasive procedure was being used less than it could be.

The main reason for the surgery is osteoarthritis. About half of all patients should be suitable for a partial replacement, but an analysis of data routinely collected by the National Joint Registry showed that of 98,147 knee replacements undertaken in 2016, only 9% were partial.

“The main strength of this study is that we were able to use real data, from very large numbers of people, about their actual operations, their GP visit, and their own reported quality of life outcomes in a way that is not always possible,” said Dr Rafael Pinedo-Villanueva, the co-lead researcher and NDORMS senior health economist, who is funded by the National Institute of Health Research Oxford Biomedical Research Centre and the Medical Research Council.

“This has allowed us to provide strong proof that partial knee replacements are both better for patients and cheaper for the NHS.”

Whether people had a partial or total replacement varied by surgeon, as did the success of the operation, the researchers discovered. Those surgeons who carried out more partial replacements had better outcomes from them than surgeons who did fewer.

“This is an important finding,” said co-lead researcher Prof David Murray. “If surgeons aim to use partial knees in a quarter or more of their knee replacements this will substantially improve the results of knee replacement and will save money. In addition, more partial knee replacements will be done and more patients will benefit from this procedure.”

Ed Burn, first author of the paper, said they needed to get surgeons on board. “For patients and the NHS to see the benefits of partial replacements, we need the buy-in of surgeons, who would need to feel comfortable performing a greater proportion of their knee replacements as partials,” he said.

“If we see surgeons carrying out this procedure more often, the proportion of knee replacements that are partials would increase from the current figure of 9% and we would see an increase in future economic and population health gains.”",1
"Scientists have announced the development of a highly accurate and reliable technique for diagnosing prostate cancer. The Dundee University-based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography (SWE) to detect prostate tumours. The method is non-invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques.

Prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the UK. One in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than 47,000 new cases being diagnosed every year. Men aged 50 or over, men with a family history of prostate cancer, and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition.

“Current diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient, leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients,” said the Dundee University team’s leader, Professor Ghulam Nabi. “Our new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery.”

The prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut. Current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate (known as a digital rectal examination or DRE), MRI scans, a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate-specific antigen (PSA) in the blood.

Each carries problems. PSA results can be unreliable; a DRE is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment; MRI scans cannot always give a definitive answer; while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive.

The new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound. Cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour.

“We have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as MRI,” added Nabi. “The technique has picked up cancers which MRI did not reveal. We can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous, where it is and what level of treatment it needs. This is a significant step forward.”

The trial tests involved around 200 patients. “Now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer,” Nabi said.

SWE technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases. However, to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team.

“The technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers, while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer,” said Simon Grieveson, head of research funding at Prostate Cancer UK, which funded the Dundee project (with support from the Movember Foundation).

“With an average of one man dying every 45 minutes from prostate cancer in the UK, the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever.”

In the past few years, a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease, including Michael Parkinson, Ian McKellen and most recently Stephen Fry, the comedian and former rector of Dundee University, who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour.

“This breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the UK, not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence,” said Fry. “It is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging.

"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - A late-stage trial of Amgen Inc’s experimental drug Aimovig found that it reduced episodic migraines by at least half in 30 percent of patients who had failed up to four previous treatments, while 14 percent of placebo patients achieved that goal, the company said on Tuesday.

FILE PHOTO: An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California October 21, 2013. The biopharmaceutical company reports earnings on Tuesday. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith

The 12-week trial, presented this week at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology, involved 246 patients suffering four to 14 migraine headaches a month who had tried two to four preventive treatments that either did not work for them or had intolerable side effects.

“This is a trial in really difficult to treat patients,” professor Uwe Reuter, trial investigator and managing medical director at Charité Universitätsmedizin in Berlin, told Reuters in a telephone interview. He said previous studies excluded patients who had tried more than two other treatments.

Reuter said the 17-point gap between the treatment and placebo groups was in line with previous Aimovig studies.

Aimovig, currently under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, is likely to be the first drug in a new class designed to target calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP), which plays a key role in migraine activation. A decision by the FDA is due by May 17.

Amgen has partnered with Novartis AG to co-commercialize Aimovig in the United States, while Amgen has rights to the drug in Japan and Novartis has rights to commercialize in rest of world. The drug, a monoclonal antibody, was given monthly by injection at a dose of 140 mg for the trial.

Similar drugs are under development at companies including Eli Lilly & Co and Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd, but Amgen emphasizes that Aimovig is the only one that targets the CGRP receptor pathway, rather than CGRP itself.

Aimovig has the “potential to help fill treatment gaps in more difficult patient populations whose migraine has not been adequately managed with current therapies,” Sean Harper, executive vice president of research and development at Amgen, said in a statement.

Amgen said Aimovig trial patients also had statistically and clinically meaningful improvements in secondary trial goals including fewer monthly migraine days and better physical function.

Researchers said no Aimovig patients stopped treatment due to side effects, while around 1 percent of placebo patients discontinued because of side effects.

Analytics firm GlobalData has forecast that CGRP antibodies will generate combined sales of $4 billion by 2026.",1

MONDAY, April 16, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- People with chronic back pain often try painkillers and other treatments without success. Now, a new study suggests a program of education and exercise may provide relief.

Helping patients think differently about pain and encouraging them to move in ways they previously feared appears to ease pain and improve function, researchers say.

""People with chronic neck and/or back pain should be educated about their pain, [and] should be reassured,"" said lead researcher Anneleen Malfliet.

They should ""learn to put pain into the right perspective, should remain active or increase their activity levels gradually, and should avoid fear of moving,"" said Malfliet, of Vrije University Brussels in Belgium.

Physical therapists and doctors can guide patients in this process, she added.

""They should also avoid the use of scary, unreassuring labels or diagnoses,"" and not limit movement in therapy, she said.

To test the experimental approach, Malfliet and her colleagues randomly assigned 22 men and 38 women to the program. They assigned another 25 men and 35 women to standard care -- exercise, and back and neck education.

""The experimental therapy, focusing on functionality, not using pain as a reliable symptom, and not as a guideline to adapt movements or activities, leads to better treatment outcomes,"" Malfliet said.

The program led to a significant and clinically important reduction of pain, she said.

Patients in the program reported 50 percent less pain after the treatment. They also reported paying less attention to pain.

In general, they also had less disability, a reduced fear of moving, and improvement in mental and physical outlook, according to the study authors.

""These positive effects were found until the last follow-up measurement at one year after treatment,"" Malfliet said.

The program involves ""pain neuroscience education with cognition-targeted motor control training,"" she said.

What does that mean?

Pain neuroscience education aims to change patients' beliefs about pain, to increase their knowledge of pain and to decrease its threat, Malfliet said.

Besides focusing on the makeup of the spine, the program stressed lifting techniques and stretching. Participants also learned the value of strength, endurance and fitness training.

Many back patients are afraid certain movements will cause them pain, so they avoid them. The new exercises are designed to help overcome that fear, Malfliet said.

The regimen included the best known exercises for back pain and general exercises, she said. It also included group classes, online activities and personalized training sessions.

""Be active, and move without fear of pain or reinjury,"" Malfliet said. ""Your level of activity or way of moving before the chronic pain began should be used as a guideline target.""

Whereas back pain studies involving exercise and drugs have shown changes to the brain's gray matter, the program in this study found no brain changes, Malfliet said.

Dr. Kiran Patel is director of neurosurgical pain at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

Patel said the dual mental and exercise approach is used to treat phantom pain in patients after a limb amputation. It's rarely used for back pain, she said.

But this study suggests these methods also can help reduce spinal pain, she said.

""The program, however, is quite time-intensive and is not covered by insurance,"" Patel said.

""Although it's promising, we really have to see the benefit long-term to justify the cost,"" she added.

The report was published online April 16 in JAMA Neurology.

"The reports underscore the increasingly important first-line role that immunotherapy, which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells, is taking against the deadliest cancer.

AD

“Immunotherapy is rapidly, in combination with other treatments and on its own, dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer,” said Leena Gandhi, an oncologist at NYU Langone Health who led the study on the immunotherapy-chemotherapy combination, called Keynote-189. “Instead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve, immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build.”

AD

Lung cancer is the second-most-common malignancy in the United States, after breast cancer. The American Cancer Society estimates that 234,000 people will be diagnosed with the disease this year, and 154,050 will die of it.

Most patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer — disease that has spread beyond its original site — initially receive chemotherapy, which provides only marginal benefit. But the disease is so lethal that many patients don’t survive long enough to try second- or third-line treatments, so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier.

AD

The trial that grabbed much of the spotlight Monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than 600 untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non-small cell lung cancer — a common type of the disease. The patients did not have cancer-causing mutations. One group was treated only with chemo, while the other got an immunotherapy drug called Keytruda plus chemo. Some of the results had been released previously, but not specific details.

AD

After a median follow-up time of 10.5 months, Gandhi said, the patients in the combination group were 51 percent less likely to die, compared with patients in the chemo-only arm.

“For the first time, adding another drug has significantly impacted the long-term outlook for those patients,” she said.

AD

Scientists who weren't involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant. H. Jack West, an oncologist at Swedish Medical Center in Seattle, said, “It is literally practice-changing — immediately.”

Roy Herbst, an oncologist at Yale Cancer Center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before. Still, he said, the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement. The estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about 34 percent, about double the proportion for the chemo-only group.

AD

Last May, the Food and Drug Administration approved the Keytruda-chemo combination based on an early-stage trial. But many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn’t initially show a survival benefit, Gandhi said.

AD

Experts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the Keytruda-chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein, called PD-L1, found on their cancer cells. Researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy.

Last week, in a related development, Merck, which makes Keytruda, reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone, compared with chemo. Experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo.

AD

In a second study published Monday, researchers used two other immunotherapy medications — Opdivo and Yervoy, both made by Bristol-Myers Squibb — to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors.

AD

The patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen, compared with people who received only chemotherapy, said Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center oncologist Matthew Hellmann, who led the study.

He said the results established the double-immunotherapy combination as a first-line treatment for patients with a high “tumor mutational burden,” but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival. And he said the trial showed that “tumor mutational burden” is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications.

AD

Another study published Monday used immunotherapy in a different way — for patients with early-stage lung cancer. Researchers at Johns Hopkins and Memorial Sloan Kettering gave patients two doses of Opdivo — the first a month before surgery, the second two weeks before the operation — to try to stimulate anti-tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse.

AD

Nine of the 20 patients who got Opdivo had a “major pathologic response” — a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery.

Drew Pardoll, director of Hopkins’ Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy, said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival. But if future studies show that, he added, then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery.

"Researchers report some of the most encouraging results yet for treating lung cancer with the latest immune-based treatments, most of which have been approved to treat other types of tumors.

In three papers presented at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, and published simultaneously in the New England Journal of Medicine, lung cancer experts found innovative ways to weaken lung tumors to improve people’s chances of surviving the disease.

“There is definitely a high unmet need,” says Patrick Forde, assistant professor of oncology and associate member of the Bloomberg-Kimmel Institute for Cancer Immunotherapy at Johns Hopkins, of the lack of effective treatments for lung cancer. Currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return, and chemotherapy typically leads to only a 5% improvement in people’s chances of living five years — but an up to 70% chance of being exposed to serious toxicities.

The studies involve a group of immune-based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors, which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system. The medications target a protein called PD-1, its related PD-L1, or CTLA-4, which protect the body’s cells from being killed by immune cells; because tumors are normal cells growing out of control, they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells. A series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs, first approved in 2011 initially for treating melanoma, expose the tumor cells to the immune system. Based on their success in treating skin cancers, scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers, including tumors in the lung.

In one study, called CheckMate-227, researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Nearly 300 people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune-based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment. After nearly a year, the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was 42% less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy.

What’s more, say the study’s authors, doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two-drug combination of nivolumab (Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) and which are not. In the study, he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress.

Currently, lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy, but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person’s disease in order to improve their chances of survival. For example, newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person’s cancer. Doctors can also determine if a person’s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study. Putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors, “more than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision-based treatments,” says Dr. Matthew Hellmann of the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC), lead author of the study. In addition, “a year after treatment, three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy.”

The results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced NSCLC, by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first, as many doctors currently do. While nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic NSCLC, for example, that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy. This combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment, instead of chemotherapy.

There may also be other ways to improve outcomes for people with advanced NSCLC. In another study, researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immune-based checkpoint inhibitor, pembrolizumab (Keytruda), helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy. People getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were 51% less likely to die after 10.5 months than people receiving chemotherapy alone. “The magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see,” says Dr. Leena Gandhi, associate professor of medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center and co-author of the study. Pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about 25% to 30% of people with advanced NSCLC who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug, but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy.

The results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer. In a third, small study of 21 people diagnosed with early stage disease, researchers led by a team at Johns Hopkins and MSKCC found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse, thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer. When the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out, they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab, the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells, meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune system’s killer cells to attack them. And when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy, they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells, suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer.

“We expected to see some response, but I don’t think we expected to see a 45% significant response,” says Forde. “To give you some idea of how significant that is, with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around 20% of the time.”

Forde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re-training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time — possibly even a lifetime. “The Holy Grail is to have a relatively non-toxic therapy that could potentially use the body’s own immune system to prevent recurrence,” he says. “And while our study is only with 21 patients, the early indications from this study are very positive.”

Taken together, the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated, significantly improving people’s ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time, as well as live longer with the disease.

"I love my local YMCA for many reasons beyond my daily swim. Top of the list: the friendships and conversations in the locker room that are frequent sources of valuable information, connections and motivation. For example, I recently overheard a discussion about Y members and friends of members who had experienced devastating attacks of shingles, including one woman who nearly lost an eye and another who was left with unrelenting nerve pain.

That was the push I needed to end my procrastination about getting the new shingles vaccine, Shingrix, which was approved by the Food and Drug Administration last October after studies involving 16,600 people showed it to be far more effective at preventing this disease than the first shingles vaccine, Zostavax, which I had had a decade earlier. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that people 50 and older, including those previously immunized with Zostavax, should now get the Shingrix vaccine.

The process was surprisingly simple and less costly than I had anticipated (list price is $280 for the two-part shot without insurance). All I needed was a prescription from my doctor. I took it to my local pharmacy, where a staff pharmacist administered the vaccine. I’ll get the second part the same way in May. My Medicare Part D insurance covered it with a $40 co-pay for each part. (The cost may be higher if the vaccine is administered in a doctor’s office, so check first.)

Many millions of Americans, especially those older than 40, are susceptible to an eventual attack of shingles, caused by the very same virus that causes chickenpox. Once this virus, varicella zoster, infects a person, it lies dormant for decades in nerve roots, ready to pounce when the immune system is weakened, say, by stress, medication, trauma or disease. One-third of Americans eventually get shingles, but the risk rises with age, and by age 85 half of adults will have had at least one outbreak of shingles.",1

(CNN) Experts have proposed using medical marijuana to help Americans struggling with opioid addiction. Now, two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy.

The studies, published Monday in the journal JAMA Internal Medicine , compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not. One of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicare Part D between 2010 and 2015, while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by Medicaid between 2011 and 2016.

The researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had 2.21 million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under Medicare Part D, compared with those states without medical cannabis laws. Opioid prescriptions under Medicaid also dropped by 5.88% in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws, according to the studies.

""This study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications,"" said David Bradford , professor of public administration and policy at the University of Georgia and a lead author of the Medicare study.

""And for pain patients in particular, our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective.""

Medicare Part D, the optional prescription drug benefit plan for those enrolled in Medicare, covers more than 42 million Americans, including those 65 or older. Medicaid provides health coverage to more than 73 million low-income individuals in the US, according to the program's website

""Medicare and Medicaid publishes this data, and we're free to use it, and anyone who's interested can download the data,"" Bradford said. ""But that means that we don't know what's going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population, and for that, I'm afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive.""

'This crisis is very real'

The new research comes as the United States remains entangled in the worst opioid epidemic the world has ever seen. Opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past 15 years and has been implicated in over 500,000 deaths since 2000 -- more than the number of Americans killed in World War II

""As somebody who treats patients with opioid use disorders, this crisis is very real. These patients die every day, and it's quite shocking in many ways,"" said Dr. Kevin Hill , an addiction psychiatrist at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School, who was not involved in the new studies.

""We have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years, and it's certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we're feeling,"" he added. ""I don't think that's the only reason, but certainly, it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids.""

Like opioids, marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain as well as other conditions such as seizures, multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse . Research suggests that the cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems rely on common signaling pathways in the brain, including the dopamine reward system that is central to drug tolerance, dependence and addiction.

""All drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways. For example, cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain,"" Hill said. ""So it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other.""

But unlike opioids, marijuana has little addiction potential, and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the United States, according to Bradford.

""No one has ever died of cannabis, so it has many safety advantages over opiates,"" Bradford said. ""And to the extent that we're trying to manage the opiate crisis, cannabis is a potential tool.""

Comparing states with and without medical marijuana laws

In order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids, the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions.

Both teams, in fact, did find that opioid prescriptions were significantly lower in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws. The team that looked at Medicaid patients also found that the four states that switched from medical use only to recreational use -- Alaska, Colorado, Oregon and Washington -- saw further reductions in opioid prescriptions, according to Hefei Wen , assistant professor of health management and policy at the University of Kentucky and a lead author on the Medicaid study.

""We saw a 9% or 10% reduction (in opioid prescriptions) in Colorado and Oregon,"" Wen said. ""And in Alaska and Washington, the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant.""

The first state in the United States to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was California, in 1996. Since then, 29 states and the District of Columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis. All of these states include chronic pain -- either directly or indirectly -- in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use, according to Bradford.

The details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns, the researchers found. States that permitted recreational use, for example, saw an additional 6.38% reduction in opioid prescriptions under Medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use, according to Wen.

The method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns. States that permitted medical dispensaries -- regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products -- had 3.742 million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under Medicare Part D, while those that allowed only home cultivation had 1.792 million fewer opioid prescriptions per year.

""We found that there was about a 14.5% reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on -- and that was statistically significant -- and about a 7% reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on,"" Bradford said. ""So dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates.""

The impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed. Specifically, states with medical cannabis laws saw 20.7% fewer morphine prescriptions and 17.4% fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws, according to Bradford.

Fentanyl prescriptions under Medicare Part D also dropped by 8.5% in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws, though the difference was not statistically significant, Bradford said. Fentanyl is a synthetic opioid, like heroin, that can be prescribed legally by physicians. It is 50 to 100 times more potent than morphine, and even a small amount can be fatal, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse

""I know that many people, including the attorney general, Jeff Sessions, are skeptical of cannabis,"" Bradford said. ""But, you know, the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl.""

'A call to action'

This is not the first time researchers have found a link between marijuana legalization and decreased opioid use. A 2014 study showed that states with medical cannabis laws had 24.8% fewer opioid overdose deaths between 1999 and 2010. A study in 2017 also found that the legalization of recreational marijuana in Colorado in 2012 reversed the state's upward trend in opioid-related deaths.

""There is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that legal access to marijuana can reduce the use of opioids as well as opioid-related overdose deaths,"" said Melissa Moore , New York deputy state director for the Drug Policy Alliance. ""In states with medical marijuana laws, we have already seen decreased admissions for opioid-related treatment and dramatically reduced rates of opioid overdoses.""

Some skeptics, though, argue that marijuana legalization could actually worsen the opioid epidemic. Another 2017 study , for example, showed a positive association between illicit cannabis use and opioid use disorders in the United States. But there may be an important difference between illicit cannabis use and legalized cannabis use, according to Hill.

""As we have all of these states implementing these policies, it's imperative that we do more research,"" Hill said. ""We need to study the effects of these policies, and we really haven't done it to the degree that we should.""

The two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in Medicaid and Medicare Part D, meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire US population.

But both Hill and Moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years, more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy.

""There is a great deal of movement in the Northeast, with New Hampshire and New Jersey being well-positioned to legalize adult use,"" Moore said. ""I believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in Arizona, Florida, Missouri, Nebraska and South Dakota as well that voters will decide on in Fall 2018.""

Hill called the new research ""a call to action"" and added, ""we should be studying these policies. But unfortunately, the policies have far outpaced the science at this point.""",1

Take Elliott Francis, 64, who had his second hip replacement surgery in February. Growing up, he was “a jumper and a rebounder,” he said, scooping basketballs off the rim during Roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college.

For a generation that pounded its joints doing aerobics, running marathons, and carving up the ski slopes, it’s time to roll out the spare parts.

Baby boomers, determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought, are fueling a surge in joint replacements. Taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods, aging Americans are getting so many new hips, knees, shoulders, and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand.

Hip replacements in the United States more than doubled between 2000 and 2014 — from 160,282 to 371,605 a year — according to the most recent data from the Healthcare Cost and Utilization Project, which tracks hospital discharges. Knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period, from 274,467 to 680,886.

The procedures can cost up to $50,000 for knees and $40,000 for hips, though the prices vary widely among Medicare and private insurers, which typically bear the bulk of the cost. The average age of patients listed in the American Joint Replacement Registry is about 66.

With millions more boomers still in their late 50s and early 60s, the trend will only continue.

“They’re aging, they’ve had some injuries, and they want to continue to be active into their 60s, 70s, and 80s. And they need a good joint to do that,” said Dr. David Mattingly, surgeon in chief at New England Baptist Hospital in Boston, one of the nation’s top orthopedics centers.

The surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky-high expectations — something doctors struggle to manage. Despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes, replacement joints don’t create superhumans. Still, many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym, the golf course, or the cross-country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital.

Winthrop retiree John Carver, 76, is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in February. “My goal is to get back to an hour — 30 minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises,” he said. A Marine veteran who ran the New York City Marathon the year he turned 40, Carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in May, early enough “to be ready for golf season.”

For those who are still working at physically demanding jobs, there are other considerations.

“I’m up and down the scaffolding all day,” said David Smith, 62, of Arlington, a construction superintendent in Boston who had a hip replacement in January. “My first focus was to just get on my feet so I can work another 10 years. So I said, ‘OK, let’s get this done.’ ”

Smith, who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites, plans to return to his job this spring. But he has already resumed golfing — on a March trip to visit his son and his family in Atlanta. And, he promised, “I will get on the skates again.”

Like Smith, many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery, pain caused by “bone-on-bone” friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning. Some took multiple cortisone shots, hoping to avoid surgeries. But having had the procedures, many say they wish they’d done it sooner.

West Newbury’s town clerk, Mike McCarron,, 62, played high school and college football and once climbed Mount Washington in the winter. McCarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in 2011. “I had a coupon,” he joked. Now he runs on the treadmill at his Merrimack Valley gym and hikes in the Maine wilderness.

Susan Nadworny, 61, of Melrose, owned an aerobics studio in Boston’s North End during the 1980s and 1990s. There, she spent three or four hours a day leading high-impact exercise classes. Nadworny, who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities, had knee replacement surgery last April. Nearly a year later, she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods.

The vast majority of joint-surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward, with success rates topping 95 percent, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons, a physicians organization. In patient-reported surveys, some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures. Smaller numbers suffer serious complications, ranging from blood clotting to hospital-acquired infections.

New England Baptist expects to perform a record 7,000 knee and hip replacements at its Mission Hill campus this year, a nearly sixfold increase from the 1,200 annually it did in the mid-1980s. “Most of the busy guys do 15 to 20 a week,” Mattingly said.

Last year, the average salary for joint-replacement specialists topped $575,000, reported the Dallas consulting firm Merritt Hawkins & Associates, compared with just over $230,000 for family doctors.

Because of improvements in materials and the way they’re treated and sterilized, implants — which include polyethylene and titanium alloys — don’t wear down as fast as they once did. Implants now have a 90 percent chance of lasting two decades, much longer than in the past, Mattingly said.

While physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration, genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when, he said. Knee replacements were first offered in the 1960s, and hip replacements began in the 1940s, so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent.

But boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn’t mean they can resume all of the high-impact activities that were a major part of their lives.

“Nobody will return to playing football,” Mattingly said. “The person who struggles is the one who’s done long-distance running for years and just doesn’t want to give it up.”

Technology could eventually change that. Joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients, but a Billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further. ConforMIS Inc. uses 3-D printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints. It sells between 17,000 and 20,000 personalized knee implants a year — still a small share of the market — and last year won US regulatory approval for its first hip implants.

“The baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care,” said ConforMIS chief executive Mark Augusti. “Technology has to be part of the solution. Baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years.”

Stephanie Donvan, 60, of Arlington, who received a ConforMIS knee replacement in May, recalled feeling like she was “carrying a dead tree trunk” before the surgery.

Now, she said, “I’m out walking my Lab about five miles a day, every day. I can run in the snow and ride my bike. I have complete range of motion . . . We want to keep going till we’re in our 80s or 90s. We don’t want to give up all the things we’re doing.”

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche’s Tecentriq immunotherapy combined with other drugs boosted lung cancer patients’ survival versus an older cocktail, the Swiss company said as it seeks an edge on Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb.

Mixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies.

The latest trial success follows Roche’s announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer.

The Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail.

While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading.

“We are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,” said Sandra Horning, Roche’s chief medical officer.

She also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers.

The world’s biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals’ cheaper copies.

Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an “already robust” set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq’s use as an initial treatment of lung cancer.

“We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,” Baader’s Bruno Bulic said.

“Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche’s profitability going forward.”",1
"The Pap test has already reduced the incidence of cervical cancer by more than 60%. Now it may become a key step in the early detection of two other gynecological malignancies — ovarian and endometrial cancers — that have been notorious killers because they’re typically caught so late.

A new study has found that by genetically analyzing the harvest of cells from a Pap smear, doctors could identify 81% of endometrial cancers and 33% of ovarian cancers. Some of those cancers were in their earliest stages, when they’re more likely to respond to treatment.

When the Johns Hopkins University researchers tested an alternative means of collecting cells — a longer brush that sweeps cells from the lining of the uterus — they positively identified endometrial cancer in 93% of cases and ovarian cancer in 45% of cases.

And when they added a blood test to the ovarian cancer screening regimen, they were able to detect that deadly cancer in 63% of patients who had it.

“Having the possibility to detect these cancers earlier is very exciting,” said Dr. Nickolas Papadopoulos, a coauthor of the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

It’s the latest example of how scientists hope to detect cancer earlier and with greater precision by looking in blood and other easily accessible fluids for cells that bear the telltale genetic mutations of cancer.

While such “liquid biopsies” have not yet made their way into widespread use, they hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer screening.

In January, the same research team presented promising findings in the journal Science on a blood test called CancerSEEK that’s capable of detecting malignancies of the liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colon, lung and breast. Earlier this week, they published findings in the journal eLife on a urine test to detect cancers of the urothelial tract or urinary bladder.

As a screening test for cervical cancer, the Pap smear has been a staple of gynecological checkups for more than six decades. It’s named for Dr. George Papanicolaou, the physician who first showed that cancerous cells of the cervix could be detected by microscopic inspection.

The Pap test has dramatically driven down deaths from cervical cancer, which used to be one of the most common cancers in women. However, the test does a poor job of detecting endometrial or ovarian cancer, which together kills about 25,000 women in the United States each year.

Women thought to be at high risk of those cancers are sometimes screened with a blood test that detects an immune system biomarker called CA-125, or with a transvaginal ultrasound that looks for telltale thickening of the uterus’ endometrial wall. But those tests fail to detect many cancers, and also send up a lot of false alarms. So they’re frequently not used until a woman complains of symptoms.

The result is often a diagnosis at an advanced stage, when treatments are more invasive and less likely to be successful.

Tumor cells from ovarian and endometrial cancers shed and are carried into the uterine cavity and endocervical canal, where they can be collected with the Tao brush or the Pap brush. (Y. Wang et al. / Science Translational Medicine )

In the new study, the researchers measured the accuracy of their PapSeek test on 1,658 women. They already knew that 1,002 of the women were free of either cancer and 656 of them had either ovarian or endometrial cancer.

Researchers collected cervical fluid samples with a Pap smear brush and a slightly longer tool called a Tao brush, which reaches beyond the cervix and into the uterus, nearer to where ovarian and endometrial cancers take hold. Then they used the PapSeek test to sequence the samples, focusing on 18 genes that tend to develop mutations in those cancers. The test also checked the samples for aneuploidy, the presence of abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cells.

When the researchers used the longer Tao brush, they were able to detect endometrial cancer in all but 7% of the women who had the disease, and close to half of the ovarian cancers. Combined with the fact that these tests were performed with a mere swipe of the uterine wall, these measures of “sensitivity” — the ability to detect cancers that are actually there — represent a major improvement over the screening tests currently available.

When they supplemented the analysis of Pap and Tao brush samples with a hunt for mutated cells in the women’s blood, they were able to detect ovarian cancer in well over half of those who had it.

When endometrial and ovarian cancers are especially aggressive and when they have progressed to advanced stages, they are easier to find with existing screening methods. But an important measure of a test’s usefulness is whether it can detect the most aggressive types of cancer before they have metastasized.

By that measure too, the PapSeek test looked promising. When it was used to scan the Tao brush samples, it identified 89% of the high-grade endometrial cancers in patients while their malignancy was still confined to the endometrium. It was also able to identify 80% of those with high-grade ovarian cancers before they had spread.

Just as important, the tests were remarkably good at avoiding false-positive signals, which would needlessly alarm women and lead to riskier and more-invasive tests to confirm a diagnosis. For both types of cancer, the PapSeek test’s “specificity” — its ability to accurately recognize the absence of disease — approached 100%.

Papadopoulos said he was surprised and heartened that the Pap test — or a close variant of it — could be repurposed to look for gynecological cancers that are typically caught way too late.

While the team hopes to improve the test’s sensitivity, he said that even this early version would likely boost women’s chances of earlier detection by a considerable margin.

“It doesn’t have to be perfect to help at least some women” who might otherwise die of these stealthy cancers, Papadopoulos said. “Women are already used to having Pap smears, and everyone can give a vial of blood.”

TUESDAY, March 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Tiny pellets could treat arthritic knee pain, delaying the need for knee replacement surgery, a small study has found.

Microparticles inserted into small blood vessels around the knee helped reduce the pain and improve function in eight arthritis sufferers, according to clinical trial results. The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles.

""Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla.

Bagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study.

Much of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining.

To treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material.

The microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said.

""It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,"" he said.

The small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said.

Those eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said.

Physical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added.

Overall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded.

Bagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether.

""You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,"" he said.

Final results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said.

They think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said.

""Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,"" Bagla said.

Dr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure ""very promising,"" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain.

""This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,"" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study. He's a professor of radiology and surgery at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis.

Research presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration took a fresh step on Thursday towards setting a maximum nicotine level for tobacco products in a bid to lower tobacco-related deaths across the country, saying it would collect public comment and scientific research over the next three months.

FILE PHOTO: A woman disposes a cigarette in Los Angeles, California, May 31, 2012. REUTERS/Jonathan Alcorn

The move was part of a comprehensive plan the agency announced last summer to regulate tobacco and nicotine, FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said on a call with reporters. That plan marked a major shift designed to give adult smokers a wider range of alternatives, including potentially less harmful e-cigarettes.

The agency is seeking to determine a level of nicotine in cigarettes and other tobacco products that would be minimally addictive or nonaddictive, according to a draft proposal.

It hopes setting such a standard would also help prevent teenagers who experiment with tobacco from becoming addicted.

The FDA estimates that setting such a standard would help 5 million smokers quit within a year and prevent more than 33 million teens and young adults from becoming regular smokers by the year 2100.

“There is no other single action our country can take that would prevent more young people from smoking or save more lives,” said Matthew L. Myers, president of Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids.

Major tobacco players such as Altria Group and British American Tobacco are grappling with sales declines in the U.S. market and hoping to recoup revenue through novel tobacco and nicotine products such as e-cigarettes.

Altria Group has partnered with Philip Morris International to sell a novel device called iQOS, which heats but does not burn tobacco. The FDA is currently reviewing the iQOS application.

The FDA is seeking additional research and data for public review, Gottlieb said, as it tries to develop a nicotine product standard. Gottlieb said the FDA was also seeking public opinion on whether a product standard should be implemented all at once or gradually.

The comment period will be open through mid-June, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products.

The FDA will continue to take enforcement actions against companies that inappropriately target children, including through the promotion of e-cigarettes, Gottlieb said.

James Figlar, executive vice president of research and development for R.J. Reynolds Tobacco Company, part of British American Tobacco, said the company would work with the agency to create a path for alternative, less harmful tobacco products to reach the market.

The FDA will seek public input and scientific research on the role that flavors such as menthol play in tobacco addiction, and for the regulation of premium cigars, Gottlieb said.

“We’ll also advance key parts of our tobacco plan very soon,” he said.",1

TUESDAY, March 13, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A pill that combines three blood pressure-lowering drugs improves people's chances of lowering their high blood pressure, researchers report.

The pill contains low doses of the three medications -- telmisartan, amlodipine and chlorthalidone.

The finding stems from a study of 700 people, who averaged 56 years old. All had high blood pressure.

Among those who took the so-called ""triple pill"" for six months, 70 percent had achieved their blood pressure targets, compared with 55 percent of those who received their usual care. Usual care meant taking whatever blood pressure medicine their doctor prescribed.

The rate of side effects was no greater among those who took the three-in-one pill than among the usual care group.

""Based on our findings, we conclude that this new method of using blood pressure-lowering drugs was more effective and just as safe as current approaches,"" lead author Ruth Webster said in a news release from the American College of Cardiology. She's a researcher with the George Institute for Global Health at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia.

The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Orlando, Fla. The findings should be considered preliminary because research presented at meetings has not undergone the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals.

""The most urgent need for innovative strategies to control blood pressure is in low- and middle-income countries,"" Webster said. ""The triple pill approach is an opportunity to 'leapfrog' over traditional approaches to care and adopt an innovative approach that has been shown to be effective.""

High blood pressure increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and kidney problems.

""A control rate of 70 percent would be a considerable improvement, even in high-income settings,"" Webster said. ""Most hypertension guidelines in these countries do not recommend combination blood-pressure-lowering therapy for initial treatment in all people.""

The findings, she said, ""should prompt reconsideration of recommendations around the use of combination therapy.""

"A new class of drugs could be life-changing for millions of women in menopause who suffer with hot flashes.

A medication being tested in the U.K. and here in the U.S. may be the key to alleviating several of the uncomfortable menopause side effects -- and hopefully without the need for hormone replacement therapy, according to an analysis published in the journal Menopause.

""The potential for this drug class to really improve many of the symptoms of the menopause, such as hot [flashes], difficulty sleeping, weight gain, and poor concentration, is huge,"" lead author Dr. Julia Prague of the Imperial College London. ""To see the lives of our participants change so dramatically and so quickly was so exciting, and suggests great promise for the future of this new type of treatment.""

About 70 percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms -— the familiar hot flashes -- which, in some cases, last for years. This new drug, labeled MLE4901 for research, is being tested in clinical trials and offers hope for curtailing postmenopausal symptoms.

The previous ""go to"" therapy was supplemental estrogen, which proved to have side effects like blood clots or even breast cancer.

MLE4901 is taken orally and works by blocking one brain chemical called neurokinin B from binding to its receptor. The interaction between these two has been linked to the regulation of temperature in the brain when someone is deficient in estrogen—like in menopause.

""We were able to identify this new therapeutic use for the compound -- which had previously been sitting on the shelf unused -- and within three years show this type of drug may make a tangible difference to the lives of millions of women,"" Professor Waljit Dhillo, an NIHR Research Professor from the Department of Medicine at Imperial College London said.

Previous studies showed that giving women an extra amount of the brain chemical neurokinin B resulted in hot flashes -- and genetic differences between people could be the reason why some have more of the chemical, or more severe postmenopausal symptoms, than others.

This small study done at the Imperial College of London involved 37 women between the ages of 40 and 62 years who did not have a period for at least 12 months, the definition of menopause, and who suffered at least seven hot flashes per day. The groups received either MLE4901 twice a day for 4 weeks, or a placebo pill on the same schedule. Two weeks later the groups swapped their treatments.

At the end of the study, those who took MLE4901 had the frequency of their hot flashes reduced by 72 percent and the severity of hot flashes decreased by 38 percent. This improvement started as early as three days after first taking the drug and relief continued for the whole month of treatment.

""We already knew this compound could be a game-changer for menopausal women, and get rid of three-quarters of their hot flushes in four weeks,"" Dhillo added. ""But this new analysis confirms the beneficial effect is obtained very quickly -- within just three days.""

Sleep and concentration improved after three days, too, which was an added bonus. The researchers noted that those improvements could have been related to the reduction in hot flashes.

All this is promising, but more research is needed and possibly a variation in the drug. A previous study on MLE4901 was associated with liver toxicity in a few participants, which resolved when they stopped taking it. They hope slightly modifying the drug may improve that side effect.

Larger studies on MLE4901 are underway in the U.S. and U.K. that will help gain an understanding of the drug’s safety and effectiveness. Like any new drug, safety and effectiveness have to be proven to the FDA before the drug can be offered in the U.S.

Breast cancer test kits by genetic testing company 23andMe just received Food and Drug Administration approval.

The prescription-free test is the first to report on three specific BRCA1 and BRCA2 breast cancer gene mutations, according to the FDA.

By analyzing DNA collected through a saliva sample, the test detects increased risk of developing breast, ovarian or prostate cancer.

But “it has a lot of caveats,” warned Donald St. Pierre, acting director of the FDA's Office of In Vitro Diagnostics and Radiological Health. The test detects only three out of more than 1,000 known BRCA mutations. That accounts for a small percentage of people. Those most at risk of developing such cancers are of Eastern European Jewish descent.

“The test should not be used as a substitute for seeing your doctor for cancer screenings or counseling on genetic and lifestyle factors that can increase or decrease cancer risk,” he said.

These tests might help with prevention, but cannot diagnose cancer and cannot rule out your chances of getting cancer, 23andMe said.

Still, the company, which already tests DNA for other health risks as well as ancestry, said this cancer test is ""a step in the right direction.""

"This Chef Lost 50 Pounds And Reversed Prediabetes With A Digital Program

Enlarge this image toggle caption Katherine Streeter for NPR Katherine Streeter for NPR

People who are diagnosed with prediabetes can delay or prevent the disease if they change their lifestyle and lose a significant amount of weight. But here's the challenge: How can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more? Increasingly, the answer might include digital medicine.

""Just telling people to do things doesn't work,"" says Sean Duffy, CEO of Omada Health. If it were easy, there wouldn't be more than 80 million adults in the U.S. with prediabetes.

Omada has rolled out a digital program, delivered on smartphones and other devices, that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits. It includes e-coaching; peer support; education; diet and exercise tracking; and electronic nudging. (Forget to weigh in or track your meals? You'll get texts or emails reminding you to do it.)

""Week by week we have lessons on different themes, "" Duffy explains. ""They're interactive, and there's little games"" to keep it dynamic. Participants are matched with a group of peers (online) and they're led by a coach, who they can text or email back and forth with. ""We call it the symphony effect,"" Duffy says, because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track.

Getting started

Sometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight. Don Speranza is in his late 60s and lives on a farm along the Columbia River in Washington state, where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife. He's also the chef at the inn. ""I'm immersed in food all day,"" Speranza says.

Last year he received an email from his doctor at Kaiser Permanente with some test results. ""It was like a gut punch, "" Speranza says.

Based on his weight, which had been crept up to 210 pounds, and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose, he was diagnosed with prediabetes. This means his blood sugar level was elevated, but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition.

""It was a real come-to-Jesus moment,"" Speranza recalls. He knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations.

When he signed up for the Omada program, the first thing he received was a scale. He began to weigh himself daily. He also began to track what he was eating. Each day he'd log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard. His coach could see the data, too, and give him advice and encouragement.

""Oh, my coach, "" Speranza says. ""I can't sing her praises enough, she was so responsive."" Even though they never met in person, they bonded. He took her advice and suggestions.

He realized, for instance, that he ate too much of the wrong things. ""Homemade breads and croissants, pasta and pizza,"" Speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice.

Speranza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods. Temporarily, he cut out all these refined carbohydrates. He had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests.

Instead, he began to fill his plate with more protein, vegetables and healthy fats. He raises animals on his organic farm, so he eats pastured meats, and a lot of salmon.

""Week by week, I'd make one or two little changes at a time, "" Speranza says. ""It was a game changer.""

The weight began to fall off, and he started to move more. His coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine. He says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee. ""Now, I'll start the coffee,"" he says, but before he drinks it, ""I'll go outside and walk."" He tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device. He began with 2,000 steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly. And he rides a stationary bike, too.

""Now, I can almost keep up with my wife,"" Speranza says with a laugh.

Since last May, he has lost about 50 pounds (52, to be exact, but it fluctuates a bit) and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range. He no longer has prediabetes.

""I feel so much better,"" Speranza says. As a baker, he buys flour in 50 pound sacks. ""Now, when I look at [the sacks] I'm aghast to think that's what I was carrying around.""

Success is not automatic

Not every Omada Health participant makes the progress they're aiming for. After all, pulling off these changes is difficult

""I'm still on the journey to get to more optimal, health"" says Lonny Northrup, who lives in Utah. He lost weight while participating in the program, but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss, he felt stuck and he says he didn't get the personal support he would have liked from the program. ""For [many] days in a row I got an email saying, 'Hey, we noticed you didn't step on the scale,' "" he says. ""For some reason that didn't get escalated to the coach."" So he says that was a disappointment.

Overall, he says he would recommend the Omada Health program to a friend. ""I got really good, specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle,"" Northrup says. And he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key, too.

There is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working. A recent pilot study with Utah-based Intermountain Healthcare that included about 200 people, all of whom were at high risk of Type 2 diabetes, found that 75 percent of the participants completed the Omada program and lost at least 5 percent of their body weight. And about 1 in 4 participants lost 7 percent of their body weight or more. That's promising, because there's evidence that a 7 percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about 60 percent.

""This is one of the most exciting things,"" says Mark Greenwood, a physician with Intermountain.

Omada Health is not the only player in this space. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs, delivered both in-person and online, including Vida, which bills itself as a ""health transformation team"" that is data and tech-driven.

Additionally, traditional players in the weight loss space, such as Weight Watchers, now offer some similar incentives, such as personal coaching.

Greenwood says he'd like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs. And he says he's pleased with the results of the pilot study of Omada's program.

""The data really does confirm that when you give people tools and help, instead of just preaching to them, it really does help.""",1
"Chemotherapy is administered to a cancer patient via intravenous drip in Durham, N.C. IVs are one of the most common things in health care.

New research calls into question what’s in those IV bags that nearly every hospitalized patient gets. Using a different intravenous fluid instead of the usual saline greatly reduced the risk of death or kidney damage, two large studies found.

The difference could mean 50,000 to 70,000 fewer deaths and 100,000 fewer cases of kidney failure each year in the U.S., researchers estimate. Some doctors are hoping the results will persuade more hospitals to switch.

“We’ve been sounding the alarm for 20 years” about possible harms from saline, said Dr. John Kellum, a critical care specialist at the University of Pittsburgh. “It’s purely inertia” that prevents a change, he said.

Kellum had no role in the two studies, which were discussed Tuesday at a critical care conference in San Antonio and published by the New England Journal of Medicine. Federal grants helped pay for the work.

IVs are one of the most common things in health care. They are used to prevent dehydration, maintain blood pressure, or give patients medicines or nutrients if they can’t eat.

Saline — salt dissolved in water — has been the most widely used fluid in the U.S. for more than a century even as evidence has emerged that it can harm kidneys, especially when used a lot.

Other IV solutions called balanced fluids include saline but also contain potassium and other things that make them more like plasma, the clear part of blood. They’re widely used in Europe and Australia.

The studies involved 28,000 patients at Vanderbilt University who were given IVs of saline or a balanced fluid. For every 100 people on balanced fluids, there was one fewer death or severe kidney problem.

Since there are about 30 million people hospitalized in the U.S. alone each year, “there are tens or hundreds of thousands of patients who would be spared death or severe kidney problems by using balanced fluids instead of saline,” said one study leader, Vanderbilt’s Dr. Matthew Semler.

After seeing the results two months ago, Vanderbilt hospital officials decided to primarily use balanced fluids. The University of Pittsburgh also has largely switched to them, Kellum said.

The fluids cost about the same — a dollar or two per IV — and many suppliers make both types, so switching should not be hard or expensive, doctors said.

IV fluids have been in the news since Hurricane Maria hit Puerto Rico last fall, shutting down electricity to three plants owned by Baxter International (BAX), one of the biggest makers of these fluids. The shortage has eased, but some supply issues remain.

"(Reuters Health) - People who get minimally-invasive surgery to replace damaged heart valves have an easier time completing daily tasks and a better quality of life after the procedure, a research review suggests.

The analysis focused on people with what’s known as aortic stenosis, which occurs when the large blood vessels leading away from the heart narrow, forcing it to work much harder to pump blood. The condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain, shortness of breath, fatigue and heart failure.

Patients in the study had minimally-invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place. This procedure, known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement, is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin - it doesn’t require cutting open the chest.

Afterward, patients could walk significantly further in six-minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity. On average, they added almost 42 meters (138 feet) to their performance before surgery.

In addition, patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery.

The results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion, said Dr. David Cohen, director of cardiovascular research at Saint Luke’s Mid America Heart Institute in Kansas City, Missouri.

“These symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity (inability to perform physical exertion) and also impact a patient’s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life,” Cohen, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email.

“By replacing the diseased aortic valve, transcatheter aortic valve replacement (and surgical valve replacement) reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her ‘normal’ quality of life - limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have,” Cohen said by email.

Overall, the current analysis included 2,775 patients from a total of 20 previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery.

Participants were 82 years old, on average, and they were typically considered high-risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues.

The smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from 36 to 484 patients, and most of them followed patients for as long as six to 12 months after surgery.

One limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life, lead study author Nicola Straiton of the University of Sydney and colleagues note in Age and Ageing. Straiton didn’t respond to emails seeking comment.

People who don’t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve.

Surgeons may also perform what’s known as angioplasty, which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve; sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent, or tiny wire mesh cage, to keep the artery propped open.

Results of the current study reaffirm that a minimally-invasive procedure can be a viable option, even for elderly people who are high-risk surgical patients, said Dr. Samir Kapadia, a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

“Replacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity,” Kapadia, who wasn’t involved in the study, said by email. “Transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed.”

"Blood and urine test, believed to be first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders

Scientists in Britain say they have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children.

Researchers at the University of Warwick said the test, believed to be the first of its kind, could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders (ASD) in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives.

ASDs mainly affect a person’s social interaction and communication, with symptoms that can include speech disturbances, repetitive and/or compulsive behaviour, hyperactivity, anxiety, and difficulty adapting to new environments.

As there is a wide range of ASD symptoms, diagnosis can be difficult and uncertain, particularly at the early stages of development. It is estimated that about one in every 100 people in the UK has ASD, with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls.

Scientists said their research found a link between ASD and damage to proteins in blood plasma. They found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma, which found children with ASD had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine (DT) and certain sugar-modified compounds called advanced glycation end-products (AGEs).

Genetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of ASD, while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors, mutations, and rare genetic variants. However, researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet-to-be-identified causes of ASD.

They also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with ASD.

The Warwick team worked with collaborators at the University of Bologna in Italy, who recruited 38 children who had been diagnosed with ASD along with a control group of 31 other children between the ages of five and 12. Blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis.

The Warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups. Working with a further collaborator at the University of Birmingham, the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between ASD and healthy controls. The outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method.

They said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify ASD at very early stages, indicate how the ASD is likely to develop further to more severe disease, and assess if treatments were working.

The research was led by Naila Rabbani, reader of experimental systems biology at the University of Warwick, who said: “Our discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention. We hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors.

“With further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles – or ‘fingerprints’ – of compounds with damaging modifications. This may help us improve the diagnosis of ASD and point the way to new causes of ASD.”

The research has been published in the journal Molecular Autism.

• Note added 27 February 2018: The UK autism research charity, Autistica, provided the following comment to the Guardian: “This is a small, early-stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism. At this stage, the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism. For example, we don’t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from ADHD, anxiety or other similar conditions. There have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism. Still, the best way to diagnose autism is through clinical interview and observation, which takes into account the many features of autism.”",0
"Story highlights The test looks for elevated levels of two proteins after brain injury

There are about 2.8 million concussion-related hospital visits every year

(CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has, for the first time, approved a blood test to help detect concussion in adults.

The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures two biomarkers: proteins known as UCH-L1 and GFAP that are released upon injury to the brain and pass through the blood-brain barrier. Elevated levels of the proteins can be detected within 15 or 20 minutes of injury. The test can be taken within 12 hours of injury, and results can be obtained within three or four hours.

Patients are currently diagnosed with concussion based on a combination of symptoms as well as imaging. However, CT scans don't always detect concussion.

""Over 90% of CT scans (for concussion) are negative. And you get 200 times the radiation of a chest X-ray. It's expensive; it's not terrific,"" said Hank Nordhoff, chairman and CEO of Banyan Biomarkers, maker of the new test. It can help determine whether a patient further needs a CT scan, based on a physician's concerns.

""Today's action supports the FDA's Initiative to Reduce Unnecessary Radiation Exposure from Medical Imaging -- an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam, at the right time, with the right radiation dose,"" FDA Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb said in a statement Wednesday.

"""Remarkable"" -- that’s how researchers are describing the results of a new study done on mice displaying traits associated with Alzheimer's disease.

The deletion of just a single enzyme saw the near total reversal of the deposition of amyloid plaques found in brains of those with Alzheimer's, improving cognitive functions in the mouse subjects, according to the study from researchers at the Cleveland Clinic, published Feb. 14 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine.

These promising research findings center around deleting a gene that produces an enzyme called BACE1, which helps make the beta-amyloid peptides that accumulate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzyme’s activity dramatically reduces production of beta-amyloid peptides, which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms -- including memory loss -- associated with Alzheimer's.

By using BACE1 inhibitors to gradually lower the enzyme's levels, researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice, offering hope for human subjects down the line, according to the study.

Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research via Journal of Experimental Medicine

However, researchers urge caution with the results as many Alzheimer’s discoveries seem to hold true in mice, then fail in people.

Cleveland Clinic researcher Riqiang Yan, Ph.D., an author on the study, told ABC News that in the mouse model, the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted, completely stopping the enzyme's production. But in humans, it’s unlikely that BACE1 inhibitors would totally halt the enzyme's production, Yan said.

Nonetheless, five BACE1 inhibitors are being tested in human subjects currently, Yan added.

“BACE1 inhibitors are still hopeful for AD patients if they have no unwanted side effects or can be tolerated for long-term use,” Yan said.

Yan added researchers are currently in phase II and, in some cases, phase III clinical trials for the various compounds.

"A Japanese drug company is offering up a big claim: Shionogi & Co. says it has an experimental pill that can kill the flu virus within a single day, according to news reports.

In a clinical trial, a single dose of the drug made by the pharmaceutical company eliminated the virus from people's bodies in a median time of 24 hours, The Wall Street Journal reported. Both Japanese and American flu patients were included in the trial.

The experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug, Tamiflu, the company told the Journal.

The drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications. The flu virus spreads through the body by invading cells. Once inside a cell, it hijacks the cell's machinery, forcing the cell to make copies of the virus. Then, the newly copied viruses break out of the cell, spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process.

This flu season could be worst in a decade

Existing drugs, including Tamiflu, work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell, the Journal reported. The experimental drug, however, kicks into action earlier, working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place, the Journal said.

Japanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in Japan by early March, the Journal reported. The drugmaker plans to apply for approval in the U.S. this summer; however, the drug likely wouldn't be available here until next year.

"Researchers have developed an ultraviolet (UV) lamp that kills the influenza virus but isn’t harmful to human skin or eyes, according to a new study in Scientific Reports. They hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places, such as schools, hospitals, and airports.

“We’ve known for a century that UV light is extremely efficient at killing microbes, bacteria, and viruses,” says study leader David Brenner, director of the Center for Radiological Research at Columbia University Irving Medical Center. For that reason, UV devices are often used for sterilization — for medical equipment in hospitals, for example, or drinking water for backcountry campers.

But conventional germicidal lamps aren’t safe for humans to be around. With prolonged exposure, they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes. “So up until now, they’re only really practical when people aren’t around,” say Brenner. “You can sterilize a hospital room, but not when anyone’s inside.”

About five years ago, Brenner says, the Columbia team came up with a potential solution. Light on the far end of the UV-C spectrum, known as far-UVC, has very short wavelengths. The researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses, but can’t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes.

“We wanted to get all the benefits of UV light in terms of killing microbes, but none of the health hazards,” says Brenner. Earlier studies, on animals and humans, have shown that exposure to far-UVC light does indeed appear to be safe. “We haven’t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells, whereas with conventional UV light we’ve always seen lots of biological damage,” he says. Previous research has also shown that far-UVC light can kill MRSA bacteria, a common cause of infections after surgery.

Now, Brenner and his colleagues have show that UVC light can effectively kill airborne influenza. In their new study, aerosolized particles of the H1N1 seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far-UVC light. The light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal UV light, while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active.

“We think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting,” says Brenner. “Think about doctor’s waiting rooms, schools, airports and airplanes—any place where there’s a likelihood for airborne viruses.” And unlike the flu vaccine, he says, far-UVC light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, including newly emerging virus strains.

Brenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp, which could become a cost-effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level. “The lamp we’re using at the moment costs less than $1,000, and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation, the price would drop dramatically,” he says. “We don’t see cost as being a limiting factor here.”

UVC lamps could also have potential implications in clinical settings, as well — in the operating room during surgeries, for example. “No matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand, the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like MRSA,” says Brenner. “If you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air, you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound.”

Brenner can’t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available, but he says he’s “extremely optimistic” about the technology. “There has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces, and this is an approach that may solve that problem.”

MONDAY, Feb. 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As a particularly nasty flu season rages across the United States, scientists have found a powerful new disinfectant that makes ""light"" work of the virus.

Researchers say a certain spectrum of ultraviolet light -- called far-UVC -- easily kills airborne flu viruses while posing no risk to people.

It could offer a new, inexpensive way to eliminate airborne flu viruses in indoor public spaces such as hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, airports and aircraft, said the team from Columbia University Medical Center in New York City.

The disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed, said lead research David Brenner.

But he believes ""the use of overhead, low-level far-UVC light in public locations would be a safe and efficient method for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis.""

As the researchers explained, broad-spectrum UVC light kills viruses and bacteria, and it is currently used to decontaminate surgical equipment. But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it's not used in public spaces.

However, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option.

In prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous ""superbug"" -- without harming human or mouse skin.

In this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus.

""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,"" said Brenner, who directs Columbia's Center for Radiological Research.

However, ""because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,"" he said in a university news release.

Lamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced.

""And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,"" he said.

Two flu experts were encouraged by the findings.

""The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,"" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y.

""Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,"" Grosso said. ""Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses.""

Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed.

He noted that the technology's cost ""is not prohibitive, and it is safe. This use can sterilize the air in a public space, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses.""

The findings were published online Feb. 9 in the journal Scientific Reports.

TUESDAY, Jan. 30, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Stimulating the brain with an implantable device may be safe -- and possibly helpful -- for some people with Alzheimer's disease, a small pilot study suggests.

In what researchers described as a ""proof of concept"" treatment, three Alzheimer's patients had deep brain stimulation (DBS) wires implanted in the brain -- in areas related to skills like planning, judgment and problem-solving.

Over the next 18 months or more, the tactic appeared to be safe. And there were ""signals"" that it was slowing down two of the patients' decline, said lead researcher Dr. Douglas Scharre, director of cognitive neurology at Ohio State University's Wexner Medical Center.

Deep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of Parkinson's disease and certain other brain disorders.

But it's far too early to know whether it has value for people with Alzheimer's, Scharre stressed.

""This is not ready for prime time,"" he said. ""It's not something patients can ask their neurologist for.""

Keith Fargo, who directs scientific programs and outreach for the Alzheimer's Association, agreed.

It's ""much too early"" for patients or caregivers to seek out DBS, said Fargo, who was not involved in the study.

Instead, he said, these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is ""a reasonable route"" to study in larger clinical trials.

The results were published online Jan. 30 in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain, then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest. Sometimes called a ""brain pacemaker,"" it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain ""circuits.""

The theory behind trying DBS for Alzheimer's patients, Scharre said, is similar to the ""use it or lose it"" principle: If key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells, it might slow decline.

Right now, Scharre noted, medications for Alzheimer's target brain chemicals involved in memory.

But Alzheimer's impairs all kinds of mental functions -- including judgment, planning and decision-making. And those issues have a huge impact on daily life, for patients and their caregivers, Scharre added.

So, the patients in his study received DBS, for at least 18 months, to brain areas that regulate those mental skills. All three patients were in the earlier stages of Alzheimer's and were on standard medications.

After starting DBS, all saw a general decline in their memory, problem-solving and other skills. But they declined at a slower rate, compared to 96 similar patients whose information was taken from an Alzheimer's research database.

Two of the DBS patients declined at a ""meaningfully"" slower rate, according to Scharre. That included one who actually showed some improvements.

That patient was LaVonne Moore, 85, of Delaware, Ohio. When she entered the study, she was not preparing any meals. After two years of deep brain stimulation, she'd regained that skill -- and was better able to perform some other simple tasks, like selecting her clothes and organizing outings.

In a Ohio State news release, her husband, Tom Moore, said her Alzheimer's has progressed, but more slowly than he'd expected.

""LaVonne has had Alzheimer's disease longer than anybody I know, and that sounds negative, but it's really a positive thing because it shows that we're doing something right,"" Moore said.

If DBS ever becomes an option for Alzheimer's, Scharre said it would not be for everyone.

It would not be appropriate, for example, for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions.

In the pilot study, side effects included hot flashes, heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin, which were reversed by adjusting the DBS settings, the researchers said.

There is no larger trial in the works yet, according to Scharre.

What's needed, said Fargo, is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device.

On a broader level, he noted, this study highlights an important point: ""Alzheimer's disease is more than just amnesia.""

For caregivers, Fargo said, the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging. So any new therapies that help address those issues would be welcome.

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's -- a number that could rise to 16 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer's Association.

"Many of these patients find themselves stuck with depression, cognitive problems, headaches, fatigue and other symptoms. Known as post-concussion syndrome, this phenomenon is often difficult to treat. Antidepressants can lift moods, painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness, but most researchers agree that these remedies don't heal the injury within the brain.

Could oxygen do the trick? A growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment, which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher-than-normal air pressure, may work.

AD

AD

""These patients don't have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains,"" said Shai Efrati, a researcher and physician at Tel Aviv University in Israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist. ""Hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain.""

But other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended.

""People want to believe that hyperbaric can fix [brain injuries], and it can't,"" said David Cifu, a researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries.

Compressed air has been used by doctors since the 17th century. In 1917, two German inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness, which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly. For the past 50 years, hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the Food and Drug Administration as a treatment for non-healing wounds, carbon monoxide poisoning, burns and decompression sickness. Over the past decade, doctors in the United States and internationally have begun using it to treat mTBIs.

MTBIs include sports-related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents. Also, between 2000 and 2017, 308,853 American service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries, according to the Department of Defense.

Patients with an mTBI typically experience symptoms that include headache, dizziness, fatigue, depression, anxiety and cognitive impairment. Known as post-concussion syndrome (PCS), this phenomenon is difficult to treat. Doctors use antidepressants, pain medications, biofeedback and physical therapy, but these strategies do not always work.

The nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury. The organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances, and even more to heal when injured. And often, the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen. So, just as the brain needs extra resources, it faces an energy crisis. Often, Efrati and others say, injured brain cells don't die, but may persist for years or decades, alive but hobbled. Hyperbaric therapy, he said, can return them to full function, even years after the injury.

AD

AD

""Oxygen is different, because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue,"" said Paul G. Harch, a physician in New Orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke.

Patients typically receive between 40 and 60 hour-long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months. During each treatment, they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber, which varies in size from a person-size tube to a large room that can hold several patients. While in the chamber, patients breathe in pure oxygen, typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea-level air; in this environment, the lungs take in about 10 times as much oxygen as under normal conditions.

Researchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains. Efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways. The extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells, and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair. It increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury, promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain, and boosts the activity of mitochondria, which provide energy to cells throughout the body. Scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue.

AD

AD

Efrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body. Pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage. ""A non-healing wound in the leg and a non-healing wound in the brain,"" he said, ""they are the same basic thing.""

Efrati came to the field accidentally. Eight years ago, as director of research at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center in Tel Aviv, he was asked to oversee the hospital's small hyperbaric chamber. He knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn't especially interested in it. But he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect. A patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn't heal — a common symptom in diabetes. The man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier, which left him unable to speak more than a few words. The hyperbaric treatment healed his feet — and also revived his ability to speak. Other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results. He began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain, and this work has become his focus. In 2008. Efrati founded and now directs the Sagol Center for Hyperbaric Medicine and Research at Tel Aviv University and Assaf Harofeh, where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility.

As the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown, it has become increasingly controversial. Critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars — the treatment typically costs between $200 and $400 per session and is rarely covered by insurance — on a technique that rarely if ever helps. Between 2009 and 2015, Cifu oversaw three studies for the Department of Veterans Affairs — reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about $70 million — of about 60 active-duty service members with post-concussion syndrome. The studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms.

Overall, there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury, in part because pressurized oxygen can't be patented, which limits its potential profitability. ""It's very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic,"" Harch said.

A few studies besides Cifu's have looked at humans. In a paper published in October, Efrati and colleagues examined 15 post-concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment. Using brain imaging, the scientists found that after treatment, the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant. They say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain. In addition, tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed. In another study, published in 2015, researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to 56 patients with prolonged post-concussion syndrome. They found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life.

While the research remains inconclusive, some American doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries.

Ziad Mirza is one of them. For most of his career, he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around Baltimore. Two years ago, he became chief medical officer for Hyperheal Hyperbarics, a company with three clinics in the Baltimore area. Since then, he said, he has treated about a half-dozen brain-injury patients, with mostly positive results.

One of these patients is Parisa Cook, 29, who in 2016 was found to have a tennis ball-size tumor in her brain. Surgeons removed it, but the operation was not a complete success. Cook, who lives in Baltimore, began to suffer from debilitating symptoms: She had problems with her short-term memory; she had constant headaches and couldn't concentrate; her vision became blurry and dark; and her hearing was altered, so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud. Specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma.

Over the course of a year, she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments. Nothing helped. A policy analyst for the Maryland Department of Health, she worried that she would have to quit her job. She began to consider suicide. ""I felt completely hopeless,"" she said.

Then Cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment. She got in touch with Mirza and began treatments. After a single session, she said, her vision was no longer wobbly; after 20 sessions over a month, she felt ""perfect."" ""It was a complete 180,"" she said. ""This treatment saved my life.""

Cook's primary-care doctor, Sujay Pathak, an internist in Baltimore, first saw her in February. ""Her life was totally interrupted by this. She couldn't function,"" Pathak said.

But a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in September, she ""got suddenly and rather miraculously better,"" Pathak said.

Of course, such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research. Efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research. ""Definitely, we need more science,"" he said. ""We have a lot to learn. But we are seeing the results with our patients. It works, again and again and again.""

"Many more stroke victims than previously thought can be saved from disability or death if doctors remove blood clots that are choking off circulation to the brain, a new study has shown.

“These striking results will have an immediate impact and save people from lifelong disability or death,” Dr. Walter J. Koroshetz, director of the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, said in a statement. “I really cannot overstate the size of this effect.”

The key finding is that there is often more time than doctors realized in which brain cells can still be rescued by a procedure to remove the clot. Traditional guidelines have set a limit of six hours after stroke symptoms begin, and said after that it would be too late to help.

The study showed that the time window could be expanded to 16 hours. However, the findings do not apply to every stroke victim. The researchers used a special type of brain imaging to identify the patients who still had live brain tissue that could be saved if the blood supply was restored. Only about half the patients who were screened qualified for treatment, known as thrombectomy, which uses a mechanical device to pull clots out of a blood vessel.",1
"A treatment is offering hope for millions of patients with sleep apnea, a disorder that causes people to stop breathing when they're asleep. An estimated 22 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea, putting them at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke and memory loss. Patients who are older, overweight and male are generally most at-risk, reports CBS News correspondent David Begnaud.

""I wasn't breathin'. I wasn't getting the correct amount of oxygen. My thought process had gone,"" said Peggy Siravo. Her memory got so bad, her family thought she had dementia. Exhausted, the 59-year-old could barely do her job as a nurse – and she knew something wasn't right.

""I knew I was in trouble,"" Siravo said.

Siravo has severe obstructive sleep apnea, where her throat muscles relax, blocking her airway and disrupting her sleep. On average, she stops breathing 53 times an hour, that's nearly once every minute during a night's sleep. She said on a night, she could be up four hours and sleep two.



She did not find relief from the CPAP machine, a common treatment that delivers constant pressurized air. She even needed oxygen on top of that.



""And then that didn't work. That's when they introduced me to Inspire and saved my life,"" Siravo said.

""Inspire"" is an FDA-approved pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest. It senses when breathing slows down and sends an electrical pulse to the tongue to stimulate it forward, keeping the airway open.



""This has been revolutionary. It's been a game changer,"" Dr. Maurits Boon said. He is Siravo's doctor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia.



""She'd given up. And she had memory issues, she was miserable,"" Boon said. ""This is not a benign disease… it actually shortens people's lives.""

A few months after having the Inspire device implanted, Siravo went to a sleep lab to see how it was working. They ran tests throughout the night. Early the next morning, Boon revealed the results.



""So before we activated the device, we have all sorts of problems… This is basically your brain saying, 'I'm not breathing.' … And after we activate the device it's perfect,"" Boon explained. ""Look at your oxygen. Nice, stable, flat line, staying around 96-97 percent. So this is good as it gets.""

""Okay,"" Siravo said.

""And as far as I'm concerned, this is a cure. This is awesome,"" Boon said.

A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 68 percent of patients experienced less sleep apnea after getting the implant.



For years, all Siravo and her husband, David, wanted was a good night's rest – and now they're finally getting it. Every night, Siravo turns on the implant before heading to bed.



""What's it like to sleep now?"" Begnaud asked.

""Great. Turn myself on. I go to sleep,"" Siravo said. ""And then I get up. And I turn myself off. And I have a normal day like you and everybody else.""

""Doesn't work for everybody. But man, it worked for you,"" Begnaud said.

""It sure did. It saved my life,"" Siravo said.

Inspire is not for everyone. It's only for moderate to severe cases, and like any surgery, there is risk of infection. For Siravo, she said her memory is back to 100 percent. The device costs around $20,000 not including the surgery.",0

THURSDAY, Jan. 11, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Injecting a calcium-based cement into the bones of some people with knee or hip pain could help them avoid joint replacement surgery, Ohio State University doctors say.

The calcium phosphate cement flows into the spongy inside portion of the bone, filling in microfractures and other damaged areas, and it hardens in about 10 minutes' time, said Dr. Kelton Vasileff, an orthopedic surgeon at the university's Wexner Medical Center.

The cement braces the bruised or injured joint bone from the inside, Vasileff explained, and eventually is replaced by new bone as part of the body's natural healing process.

The procedure, called subchondroplasty, has been available to people with knee problems for years, Vasileff said. Now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it.

It is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement, and typically is performed on an outpatient basis, Vasileff said.

The procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery, so there's less risk of infection, and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden, Vasileff said.

However, subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients. Those with full-blown bone-on-bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure, Vasileff said.

""People who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned, this isn't going to fix the arthritis,"" Vasileff said. ""But there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis. In these patients who might otherwise have needed a knee or hip replacement to deal with that, this could be an alternative.""

Software engineer Ben Wallace underwent subchondroplasty in November to help shore up a damaged hip.

""The end of September I noticed I was really struggling to move around my left leg very well,"" said Wallace, who lives in Columbus, Ohio. Imaging scans revealed a hip in very bad shape, with a misshapen femur.

A five-hour surgery cleaned up the femur and bolstered the bone with cement.

""It's been going really great. I'm better than what they expected. One week after surgery I was off the crutches, walking on my own,"" Wallace said.

""I figured I'm going to have a fake hip in there at the age of 30, which was very depressing,"" Wallace explained. ""The fact I was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise.""

Subchondroplasty has shown solid potential, but orthopedic surgeon Dr. Matthew Hepinstall is concerned that it might be ""oversold"" to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery.

""The claims that are being made are not evidence-based yet, although they are intellectually appealing,"" said Hepinstall. He is associate director of the Center for Joint Preservation & Reconstruction at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York City.

""It's just important not to oversell this,"" he added.

The best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint, but have somehow ""overloaded"" and injured the bone, causing swelling and pain, Hepinstall said.

""If you inject this substance into the bone, you're basically providing internal support, a scaffold protecting the bone. That can theoretically reduce bone pain,"" Hepinstall noted.

""The appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint, you're injecting something to help the bone, but keeping the patient's own anatomy,"" Hepinstall continued.

""But there's a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this, who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure, but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain,"" he stressed.

""We don't want to send the message to people who have bone-on-bone, with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they're all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone,"" Hepinstall said. ""This is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability, just a little thinning of the cartilage.""

"Story highlights Luxturna, a one-time treatment, corrects a genetic mutation that can lead to blindness

Spark Therapeutics set the price for the gene therapy at $425,000 per eye

(CNN) A one-time treatment with Luxturna, the first US Food and Drug Administration-approved gene therapy for an inherited disorder, will cost $425,000 per eye.

Spark Therapeutics Inc., the Philadelphia-based maker of voretigene neparvovec, announced Wednesday in a statement that it reached an agreement in principle with Harvard Pilgrim and affiliates of Express Scripts to make the one-time treatment available to patients with a rare genetic defect that often leads to blindness.

The mutation affects both eyes, usually at the same pace, so most patients would need treatment for both eyes, a Spark Therapeutics spokeswoman said.

In some cases, the gene therapy will be available under an ""outcomes-based rebate arrangement."" The company also stated that its proposal to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, the government program that covers about 100 million Americans, would allow installment payments for the drug.

""For a one-time therapy, like Luxturna, a non-traditional payment and distribution model is necessary to ensure needs of all parties -- patients, payers and providers -- are addressed,"" said Jennifer Luddy, a spokeswoman for Express Scripts.

"Scientists and health professionals gush about the benefits of exercise in study after study, and new research from the American Academy of Neurology is no exception.

The organization updated its guidelines for those with mild cognitive impairment Wednesday, and published them online in Neurology. The condition – which people develop as they age – involves issues with thinking and memory. It affects more than 6 percent of people in their 60s, and it increases to 37 percent for those age 85 and older.

Among the guidelines:

Doctors should tell people with mild cognitive impairment to exercise consistently, as six-month studies have indicated exercising twice a week could improve memory.

Medical professionals can suggest cognitive training for people, though the evidence isn't strong that this could be beneficial for improvement.

Mild cognitive impairment should not be confused with dementia – mild cognitive impairment comes with milder symptoms – though evidence has shown it can escalate to that point. Those with dementia may have trouble with daily tasks like getting dressed and making meals, but with mild cognitive impairment, people tend to have more difficulty than others their age remembering things like appointments or where they keep their car keys, the Los Angeles Times reports.

The guidelines note that no Food and Drug Administration-approved medications exist for mild cognitive impairment treatment, nor are high-quality, long-term studies in the works that imply drugs or dietary changes could aid people who have the condition.",1
"It's no secret that many people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may gravitate towards cigarette smoking. Many experts indicate that there is an association between people with the disorder and the desire to light up.

Dr. Jeffrey Newcorn, professor of psychiatry and director of the Division of ADHD and Learning Disorders at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai, says that there is indeed a relationship between ADHD and smoking. ""People with ADHD are at somewhat of an increased risk to abuse drugs,"" he says, adding that the drug they're more likely to resort to is nicotine because of its role in modulating the neurotransmission of dopamine in the brain.

People with ADHD don't produce as much dopamine – a neurotransmitter linked to the ability to regulate emotional response – as someone without the disorder. Dopamine is also associated with feelings of reward and pleasure. Research has found a connection between ADHD symptoms and lowered dopamine levels, or issues with the efficiency of the brain's dopamine receptors.

Newcorn explains that through the years there have also been some schools of thought that people with ADHD have a harder time quitting the habit. This ultimately drove researchers to think about developing a nonstimulant alternative in the form of a drug that safely mimics the effects of nicotine. However, he says that this hasn't yet panned out.

Instead, what has gained more attention, Newcorn says, is research about any possible roles ADHD stimulant medications may play in helping someone with the disorder quit, or at least reduce nicotine use. ""There has been and continues to be a lot of interest in this area,"" Newcorn says.

More About Smoking Less, Not Stopping Completely

According to Scott H. Kollins, professor and vice chair for research in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Duke University School of Medicine, there isn't a concrete ""yes"" or ""no"" to the question of whether ADHD stimulants can help an ADHD person quit. In fact, he says that rather than this being an issue of quitting the habit altogether, it appears that the focus is more about ADHD stimulants' role in possibly lessening the number of cigarettes smoked.

In fact, Kollins was involved in a study – published in the Journal of Attention Disorders – that touched on this very subject. The journal states that ""our findings suggest that among adult regular smokers with ADHD who are interested in quitting, LDX does not increase the probability of smoking cessation more than does placebo, but is associated with a significant overall reduction in the amount of cigarettes smoked and is effective for reducing ADHD symptoms."" LDX stands for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate, an ADHD stimulant more commonly known by the brand name Vyvanse.

In this and other related research Kollins has been involved with, he says that overall, ""stimulants don't necessarily help people with ADHD quit smoking; people don't really improve any greater than with a placebo."" However, he states that ""the people taking ADHD stimulants smoked less compared to those taking a placebo.""

Kollins also points out that this study yielded results comparable other research on the topic. In fact, the LDX study notes that ""findings from this study are consistent with another published trial of osmotic-release methylphenidate in adult smokers with ADHD, which reported no effects of the stimulant drug on smoking cessation outcomes, but reductions in cigarettes smoked/day and significant drug-placebo differences in ADHD symptoms across the study (Winhusen et al., 2010)."" Concerta is an example of an osmotic-release methylphenidate.

All of this begs the question: What is it about ADHD stimulant medication that may produce this effect? Kollins explains that ""stimulants do similar things from a pharmacologic perspective as nicotine"" suggesting that taking such medication may replace the urge to light up as frequently. Treatment with stimulants may put ""the urge to smoke in check more,"" he speculates.

The Road Ahead

Such research isn't to say that taking ADHD stimulants will automatically make a person with the disorder ease up on their habit. ""You certainly couldn't say that stimulants could be used for smoking cessation in people with ADHD,"" Newcorn says. ""On the other hand, stimulants are an appropriate treatment for people with ADHD whether they smoke or not."" He explains that currently, thinking about stimulants in terms of helping people with ADHD with smoking cessation means ""talking about something off-label"" – in other words, not for intended use despite the fact that certain positive outcomes may arise by taking it.

But Newcorn adds that there may be ""reasonable strategies"" such as limiting a medication to a specific group of people and within a specific class of medication. For example, he explains that Wellbutrin, an antidepressant, and Zyban, a drug to help a person stop smoking, are the same drug, but they are marketed for different things. ""Many studies show that Wellbutrin could have a positive effect for people with ADHD,"" he says, making the point that sorting through such labeling and marketing intricacies could play a role in further exploration on the topic.",1
"Could A Zap To The Brain Derail Destructive Impulses?

Enlarge this image Marco Jeurissen/Collection Mix: Sub/Getty Images Marco Jeurissen/Collection Mix: Sub/Getty Images

Picture this: While reaching for the cookie jar — or cigarette or bottle of booze or other temptation — a sudden slap denies your outstretched hand. When the urge returns, out comes another slap.



Now imagine those ""slaps"" occurring inside the brain, protecting you in moments of weakness.

In a report published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, Stanford neuroscientists say they've achieved this sort of mind-reading in binge-eating mice. They found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out — and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging.

Whether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear. For now the path seems promising. The current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard-to-treat epilepsy. And based on the new findings, a clinical trial testing this off-the-shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer, says Casey Halpern, the study's leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at Stanford. He thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life-threatening urges.

As a physician-researcher, Halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation (DBS), a surgical treatment in which battery-powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry.

The Food and Drug Administration has approved DBS therapy for movement disorders such as Parkinson's disease, tremor and dystonia — usually in people who haven't responded well to medications. Occasionally DBS is a last-resort treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).

Another study published Monday in PNAS suggests that DBS could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward-seeking behaviors.

Years ago, the Stanford team developed a mouse model to test if DBS could curb overeating. Granted, mice don't normally gorge themselves. Yet if offered fattier, tastier chow each day for just an hour, within 10 days the mice realize if they ""don't eat this now, that guy's coming back to take it away,"" Halpern says. So the animals learn to binge.

But when the researchers applied DBS stimulation to a part of the brain's reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens, the mice quit stuffing themselves.

Trouble is, the moderation wore off in a few days, and the DBS also interfered with the animals' social behavior. That got Halpern thinking about a newer system — one that doesn't stimulate continuously, like DBS, but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal, much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms.

In 2013, the FDA approved a newer-generation device, known as a responsive neurostimulation system (RNS), that does just that. Implanted within the brain, it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area. The RNS system costs around $40,000. But with medical devices, Halpern says, hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery, if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is FDA approved. In the current study, Halpern and coworkers tested the RNS device in the binging mice.

First, they looked for a biomarker — an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food. Next, the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a 10-second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker. They rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator. For comparison, other animals got continuous DBS stimulation or random pulses.

The intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols — and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video. Plus, the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction. It did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse.

The results point to a real-time biomarker for impulsive behavior, says Dennis Turner, a Duke University neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an October review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers. ""That's the clear novelty.""

Figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging. Few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research. But Halpern had a rare opportunity. One of his patients developed OCD so debilitating that he opted for DBS. He agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery. Since food isn't allowed in the operating room, the researchers monitored the patient's brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money-making task. As reported in the PNAS paper, the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make $5 but not for smaller sums, suggesting some level of specificity.

Of course, it's hard to conclude much from a single subject. But from other research ""we know it's safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens, it's safe to stimulate it electrically, and we expect to be able to tune [the electrode] as we already do with DBS. So it seems like a nice opportunity,"" says Halpern, noting that addictive disorders haven't had new therapies for decades. ""I'm motivated by the clinical need.""

"The spread of some sexually transmitted infections could potentially be dramatically reduced by instructing people who have had unprotected sex to take antibiotics within 24 hours after the intercourse, a new study suggests.

But such a strategy, which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners, could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance.

“My message with that study would be that we need to do more research to prevent STIs — because that’s a concern. And this strategy … could potentially be used,” said Dr. Jean-Michel Molina, head of infectious diseases at Saint-Louis Hospital in Paris and the lead author of the study.

advertisement

Molina insisted he would never support long-term use of antibiotics to prevent STIs, but said that the approach might be an effective short-term strategy when paired with other control approaches, like more frequent STI testing among high-risk populations.

“I don’t want this strategy to be used widely in any person, clearly,” Molina said. “But if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia, and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people, you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months.”

Rates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years; the rate in 2015-2016 — 8.7 cases per 100,000 people — was the highest since 1993, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported. The rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of 15, in both men and women, and in all ethnic groups.

Molina’s study was recently published by the journal Lancet Infectious Diseases. The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation was one of its funders.

The researchers randomly assigned 232 men to one of two groups. One of the groups was given antibiotics — the drug doxycycline — to take if they had unprotected sex. They were told to take two pills per encounter, and no more than six in a week, ideally within 24 hours and no later than 72 hours after the intercourse. In reality, the median use among the men was about 6.8 pills per month.

The men were tested regularly for STIs, and in the nine or so months they were followed, the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group. The overall reduction of all STIs was 47 percent, but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn’t cure gonorrhea.

There was, however, a 70 percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by 73 percent. The authors noted, however, that the study length was short and they can’t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term.

The results can’t be taken in isolation, others experts warned. Using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug, warned Dr. Brad Spellberg, an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the Los Angeles County-University of Southern California Medical Center in Los Angeles.

Spellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro-intestinal tracts — their own gut flora — to regular doses of doxycycline. And those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug, leading to a host of other health problems.

“You’re causing friendly fire injury,” he said.

The full picture of the knock-on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus, said Ramanan Laxminarayan, director of the Center for Disease Dynamics, Economics, and Policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance. He noted a recent report in the journal Science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics.

Molina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis, despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades. Still, he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted.

A commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower STI infection rates more generally in a community.

Authors Christopher Fairley and Eric Chow, of Australia’s Melbourne Sexual Health Center at Monash University, said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial, given that the drug is also prescribed in six-month courses to treat acne. Like Molina and his co-authors, they said STI preventive use at this point is premature.

Laxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand, however. “I certainly think that for a small subset of the population, if this helps prevent syphilis, then it certainly is worth exploring further,” he said.

But he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way, including the risk of resistance developing, the potential that it might further erode condom use, and any other unintended consequences.",1

TUESDAY, Dec. 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Physical activity appears to help people with lymphoma survive their disease.

That finding comes from a new study by Mayo Clinic researchers of nearly 4,100 people with lymphoma, a cancer that starts in the white blood cells that normally help fight infection.

""As physicians, we recommend physical activity for all cancer survivors to improve overall quality of life, but we did not know if physical activity would have an impact on survival in lymphoma patients,"" said study author Dr. Priyanka Pophali, a hematologist at Mayo Clinic.

""Our findings show that physical activity can have a positive impact on survival in lymphoma patients,"" she said in a Mayo news release.

Through periodic questionnaires, the researchers tracked the participants' physical activity levels from before their cancer diagnoses until three years afterwards.

People whose physical activity was greater than normal before diagnosis were less likely to have died from lymphoma, or from any other cause, than were those who'd been less active, the study found.

People who'd boosted their physical activity level after being diagnosed with lymphoma also were less likely to have died in that three-year span than were those who hadn't increased their activity level.

But the study couldn't prove that more exercise actually caused death risk to drop.

On the other hand, people whose physical activity level had declined after their diagnosis had higher death rates from lymphoma and other causes than those who had not changed their level of physical activity.

""Importantly, our study shows a survival benefit in patients who increase their level of physical activity,"" Pophali said. ""Therefore, since physical activity behaviors can be modified, physicians should counsel patients and survivors on the importance of physical activity and encourage them to maintain and, if possible, increase their level of physical activity.""

The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in Atlanta. Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary because it has not been subjected to the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals.

"(Reuters Health) - Leaving a bedroom door or window open may help people sleep better, a study from the Netherlands suggests.

Open windows and doors helped reduce carbon dioxide levels and improve ventilation and air flow, which was related to better sleep quality for the healthy young adults in the study.

“We spend nearly a third of our life in the bedroom environment, but the air quality in our sleeping environment is often overlooked,” said study author Dr. Asit Mishra of Eindhoven University of Technology.

“Imagine this - you are in a confined space and have limited ability to adjust the situation (since you are asleep) while you are possibly surrounded by pollutants,” he told Reuters Health by phone. “This is how things are in bed, covered under duvets or a blanket.”

For one night of the study, 17 volunteers slept with an open window or internal door. On another night, the windows and door to the room were kept closed. In the meantime, Mishra and colleagues monitored carbon dioxide levels, temperature, background noise and humidity. The study participants were asked not to drink alcoholic beverages or caffeinated drinks, which could influence sleep. They each slept alone, and the bedroom layout with furniture arrangement was kept consistent.

For measuring sleep quality, participants wore an armband that measures skin temperature, heat flux, bed temperature and skin moisture levels. They also wore a sensor that tracked their movements at night, including indications of restlessness.

Closed environments tended to have less background noise – but they also had significantly higher carbon dioxide levels, which indicated lower ventilation levels.

Open conditions were slightly cooler than closed, although humidity levels were similar across settings, according to the report in the journal Indoor Air.

Notably, carbon dioxide levels were lower when windows or doors were open.

Overall, skin temperature and the bed temperature were higher in closed conditions than open conditions. The number of awakenings and sleep efficiency improved as carbon dioxide levels decreased.

“Opening an internal door can be a reasonably good alternative if you don’t want to open windows, either for noise concerns or security concerns,” Mishra said.

A limitation of the study is that the motion sensor often slipped off the sleepers at night.

“Sleep quality is affected by many factors, such as health and emotional states, bedding conditions and different environmental conditions, including noise levels and temperature,” said Dr. Nuno Canha of the University of Lisbon in Portugal. Canha, who wasn’t involved with this study, researches indoor air quality and sleep during different ventilation patterns. He is also part of LIFE Index-Air, a European research group that focuses on human exposure to pollutants.

In a recent study, Canha and colleagues found that closed doors and windows led to higher levels of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and other substances such as formaldehyde.

“Sleep is essential to our life in several areas: health, well-being and productivity,” Canha told Reuters Health by email. “The exposure we are under while asleep is continuous . . . and we should play it safe in order to breathe better air during sleep.”

"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects 422 million people worldwide. For decades, doctors have treated it with medications designed to keep blood sugar levels down.

But in a paper published in the Lancet, researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight.

Nearly half of people in the study who were given a six-month diet plan and lost an average of 30 pounds went into remission and no longer had diabetes. None took any medications during that time to control their disease and relied on weight loss alone.

Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body’s in ability to break down sugars from the diet. Normally, cells in the pancreas work to release insulin, a hormone that can process sugar and either send it to cells that need it for energy or store it as fat for future energy needs. Cells in the liver are responsible for clearing insulin from the circulation. But excess fat in the pancreas and liver can start to shut down these insulin-producing cells, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels. Diabetes medications can bring sugar levels down but do not address the compromised insulin machinery.

In the study, Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University, and his colleagues randomly assigned nearly 300 people to either a weight management program or their usual treatments, including diabetes medications. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. The people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet.

The diet, which was designed to help people lose up to 30 pounds, involved three to five months of a strict low-calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than 850 calories a day, followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food, along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan.

Taylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. After a year, most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds, compared to two pounds in the control group. Nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more, while none in the control group were able to lose that much. Most importantly, 46% of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes, compared to just 4% in the control group.

“People newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn’t necessarily for life,” says Taylor. “It isn’t an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that.”

Previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program in the U.S. revealed in 2002 that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar. Gastric bypass surgery, which can result in dramatic weight loss, can also help to reverse diabetes, but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications.

The current study takes that work a step further and shows that it’s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently — within the past six years — and that the effect may not apply to more long-term patients. That’s because as the disease continues, he says, insulin-producing cells start to die off. Initially, the cells slowly shut down, entering a so-called resting state. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate.

But left in this state too long, the cells eventually die and cannot be revived. Studies suggest that people living with diabetes for more than 10 years, for example, may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission.

That points to an important lesson that Taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results. He says that it’s critical to discuss from the start — when people are diagnosed with diabetes — the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease. If more people can benefit from losing weight alone, then that would mean less cost to the health care system, as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease, which can include heart problems, neuropathy, vision issues and even amputations.

Taylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight, and, if they are, whether they continue to remain in remission. “From the very clear data we produced in this trial, yes, this is a watershed moment for diabetes,” he says. “We can offer people hope from the start.”

"Researchers say erenumab is ‘incredibly important step forward’ for condition that affects 8.5 million people in UK

This article is more than 1 year old

This article is more than 1 year old

A new migraine drug that can halve the length of attacks has been hailed as “the start of real change” in how the condition is treated.

Erenumab, a laboratory-made antibody that blocks a neural brain pathway called CGRP, is the first drug in 20 years proven to prevent migraine attacks.

Phase three trial data on nearly 1,000 patients showed that it typically cut between three and four “migraine days” per month. In half the patients treated, migraine duration was reduced at least by half.

Migraines could be caused by gut bacteria, study suggests Read more

Migraines are characterised by an intense, throbbing headache, sensitivity to light and noise, nausea, vomiting, low energy, and visual disturbances. Attacks can last anything from four to 72 hours.

Each year more than 8.5 million people in the UK are thought to experience migraine – more than the number affected by asthma, diabetes and epilepsy combined.

The condition is linked to depression and sick days caused by migraine are estimated to cost the UK economy more than £2bn per year.

The trial, called Strive, compared patients taking erenumab for six months with others given a non-active placebo dummy drug.



The research revealed that by months four to six, at least a 50% reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over 43% of patients injected under the skin with 70-mg of erenumab each month, while half of patients injected with the higher dose of 140-mg had such results. However, those given a placebo also saw benefits, with 26.6% of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction.



Lead investigator Prof Peter Goadsby, from King’s College hospital, London, said: “Strive … represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment.”

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, clearly showed that blocking the CGRP pathway could reduce the impact of migraine, he said. “The results of Strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood, re-purposed treatments, to a specific migraine-designed therapy.”

Simon Evans, chief executive of the charity Migraine Action, said: “Migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when, in reality, it can be a debilitating, chronic condition that can destroy lives. The effects can last for hours, even days in many cases.

“An option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed, and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived.”



“Broadly speaking I think this is a very interesting study and I think it is a good step forward for the field and I think it is a good day for migraine sufferers,” said professor Zameel Cader, Director of the Oxford Headache Centre who was not involved in the research, pointing out that the results were on a par with currently available therapies for migraine.

“Placebo responses [in migraine studies] are quite high and I think that is partly due to the subjective nature of pain and because of the strong psychological effects that being treated have on that experience of pain and those symptoms,” he said, adding that injections generally result in an even stronger placebo effect than tablets.



Cader said that he too was looking at running trials using antibodies, and said he was excited about the approach since it might result in fewer side effects than current therapies, and would mean individuals would not have to remember to take a table every day.

“This is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed, rather than serendipitously found,” he added.

Amgen and Novartis, the codevelopers of erenumab, funded the trial, while Amgen also supplied the drug and conducted the data analyses.",1
"You don’t have to break a sweat to reap the health benefits of physical activity, according to new research in the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. In a study of women age 65 and older, just 30 minutes a day of light exercise—like running errands and cleaning the house—was linked to a lower risk of death.

Moderate-intensity exercise, like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking, was associated with an even greater reduction in risk. The authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life. “The paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active,” says senior author Andrea LaCroix, professor of family medicine and public health at the University of California San Diego.

For the study, LaCroix and her colleagues asked 6,000 women, ages 65 to 99, to wear activity-tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities. The women were then followed for an average of three years.

Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now

Based on the data from the women’s activity trackers, the researchers found that those who got at least 30 minutes of light physical activity a day were 12% less likely to die, compared to those who got less. Those who got an additional 30 minutes of moderate activity were 39% less likely to die.

Light physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn’t sitting down: walking to the mailbox, strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry. Activities like these account for more than 55% of older adults’ daily activity, says LaCroix, so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news.

“We’ve always been told that this type of activity isn’t enough to do you good,” says LaCroix. “But what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman’s risk of dying over the next three to four years—and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity.”

MORE: TIME’s Guide to Exercise

The study could not show a cause-and-effect relationship between activity level and risk of death, only an association. But the link was present in all types of women in the study, including those of all races and ethnicities, women who were obese and those who were not, women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than 80.

As adults get older, they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger, LaCroix says—so they don’t need to exercise as much, or as intensely, to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up. “We know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result,” she says. “It’s not one size fits all.”

But national guidelines still recommend that adults over age 65 follow the same guidelines as younger people: to get at least 150 minutes of moderate-to-vigorous physical activity per week. And recent analyses, compiled from studies in which adults self-reported their levels of physical activity, have suggested that older adults have to log moderate-to-vigorous exercise in order to reduce their risk of early death.

LaCroix says her new study refutes that research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate-to-vigorous guidelines. Questionnaires used in self-reported studies don’t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day, she says, which may have skewed previous study results. “What makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives,” she says.

The researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people—especially older ones—think about exercise and their goals for being active. “I think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don’t believe they can do 150 minutes of hard exercise,” LaCroix says. “They throw up their hands and think, ‘that’s not for me.’ But everyone does light physical activity, and the idea that doing more of it can have substantial health benefits should be welcome news.”

"The American Heart Association has changed the definition of hypertension for the first time in 14 years, moving the number from the old standard of 140/90 to the newly revised 130/80.

The change is outlined in the American Heart Association 2017 Hypertension Practice Guidelines, an extensive report by experts without relevant ties to the pharmaceutical industry.

The changes are expected to drastically impact adult Americans: revising the hypertension threshold downward will increase the percent of U.S. adults living with high blood pressure from 32 percent to 46 percent -- nearly half of the adult population. It will also disproportionately affect younger people by tripling the number of men under 45 and doubling the number of women under 45 with the diagnosis.

American Heart Association

The new guidelines reflect years of research, which have shown that people within the new range of blood pressure defined as hypertension have doubled their risk of cardiovascular problems in the future, such as heart attacks or strokes. As such, health care professionals should be identifying these patients and helping to initiate interventions to bring down blood pressure.

While the new guidelines significantly increase the number of Americans with a diagnosis of hypertension, they do not suggest a proportionate increase in treating with medication. The number of Americans with hypertension who are recommended for medical treatment would increase by only 4.2 million adults, or 5 percent more than were previously recommended. Medication will be recommended for patients with previous cardiovascular events, such as heart attack, or significant cardiovascular risk factors determined by factors such as age, blood tests and having other medical conditions that increase risk of heart attack.

The study authors recommend lifestyle changes, including exercise, diet modifications and weight loss, as the first step to reducing high blood pressure.

Doctors in the guidelines stress the importance of using two separate blood pressure readings on two different occasions to diagnose hypertension. They recommend that those with hypertension use approved blood pressure monitors at home. Writing down these readings at home can help tell the difference between people with truly abnormal blood pressure and those with “white-coat syndrome” -- with high blood pressure only under stress like at the doctor’s office.

High blood pressure increases the risk of cardiac problems and strokes, and is sometimes called “the silent killer” because so many adults live with high blood pressure and don’t know it.

"(CNN) The first large head-to-head comparison of two opioid addiction medications found that, although they were equally effective in getting people off of high levels of opioids, users had a significantly more difficult time starting a regimen of naltrexone, compared with buprenorphine.

Buprenorphine is commonly known by the the brand name Suboxone, and naltrexone is sold under the brand name Vivitrol.

The study, published Tuesday in the Lancet , looked at 570 patients with opioid addiction at eight inpatient treatment centers across the country for 24 weeks. Half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine.

Six percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment, whereas 28% of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy.

That hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone, a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days, whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly. ""If you're currently opiate-dependent ... (naltrexone) takes more work,"" said Dr. Joshua Lee , the lead author of the study, who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at New York University.

Once on either of the medications, people fared equally well. ""They tend to stay on medications about the same rate. They report good outcomes, avoiding heroin use,"" Lee said. However, both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens: Just 40% of patients still used the drugs after 24 weeks.

What was important, Lee said, was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn't one-size-fits-all. ""Much like you would expect if the doctor told you 'you have cancer' or 'you have diabetes,' then there are different ways you could pursue treatment,"" he said.

The gold standard of addiction treatment

Public health experts consider medicated-assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment. It combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use. Public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic.

This year alone, the CDC estimates that more than 64,000 people have died of drug overdoses, most of them from opioids -- more than the number of American troops lost during the entire Vietnam War . Studies have found that using medicated-assisted treatments can reduce overdose mortality by half.

Methadone may be the best-known form of medicated-assisted treatment, but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic. Two other options have become increasingly popular: buprenorphine, which can be taken outside a clinic, and naltrexone, which is administered monthly.

Naltrexone has become become an increasingly popular choice among drug courts . Some say that's because of the once-a-month administration, and others say it's because it requires that users completely detox before starting the regimen.

Understanding addiction

""People need choices,"" said Caleb Banta-Green, a professor at the University of Washington's School of Public Health. Banta-Green, who was not involved in the new study, said that getting the right treatment means understanding addiction from a psychological as well as biological perspective.

Legally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin. They all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and, in some people, provide euphoria.

The body also produces natural opioids, but the more narcotics a person takes, the less opioids the body naturally produces. Without the opioids, people can go into withdrawal, all contributing to a cycle of dependency.

""To feel normal, they need opiates on those receptors,"" Banta-Green said. Buprenorphine and methadone, which are opioids, work by reducing people's cravings. ""They bind to prevent withdrawal, giving some opiate effect,"" he said.

On the other hand, naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors, which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen. ""You're not getting an opiate effect,"" Banta-Green explained.

If a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone, it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation. If a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone, it can induce a feeling of withdrawal. ""It addresses craving in a different way. The person knows they can't use,"" he said.

So, for example, a person who is actively using opioids and can't manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine, while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn't want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone.

What is key, said Dr. Miriam Komaromy, is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs.

Addiction ""is an incredibly deadly disease,"" said Komaromy, an addiction specialist at the University of New Mexico Health Sciences Center. And as public policymakers, prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction, public health experts like Komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at ""evidence-based ways instead of having a moralistic view.""

Banta-Green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment. ""I say this a lot to judges: You can't just offer one medication. Just like any other medication, some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other.""",1
"The question

People treated in the emergency room for a sprain, strain or fracture are generally given opioids to help them cope with the pain, often leaving with a prescription for opioids, too. Might non-opioid painkillers work just as well as these addictive drugs?

This study

The study involved 416 adults (average age, 37) who had gone to an emergency department with an extremity injury causing moderate to severe pain (averaging 8.7 on a scale of 1 to 10).

For pain, they were randomly assigned to take acetaminophen along with a non-opioid — ibuprofen — or with one of three commonly prescribed opioids: oxycodone, hydrocodone or codeine.

Within two hours, all participants reported essentially identical declines in pain, about four points on the scale. Even for people who initially had rated their pain as a 10 (for the worst pain possible) or had broken a bone, there was virtually no difference in pain reduction between those who had and had not taken an opioid.

Who may be affected?

Adults with arm or leg pain caused by a sprain, strain or fracture. Research has shown that even short-term opioid use, such as that stemming from an initial prescription for pain from an injury or surgery, can make people predisposed to a dependence on the powerful drugs — partly from their effectiveness at relieving pain and partly from the euphoria they produce. Abuse of opioids has become an epidemic in the United States, with opioids now causing 60 percent of drug overdose deaths.

Caveats

Data on pain came from the participants' ratings; no information on side effects was collected. The study did not assess longer-term pain reduction.

THURSDAY, Oct. 26, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Blood thinners may pull double duty for people with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation: New research suggests they help prevent dementia as well as stroke.

Because atrial fibrillation increases the risk for stroke, people with the condition are often prescribed blood thinners (also known as anticoagulants) to prevent blood clots that can cause a stroke.

Atrial fibrillation also increases the risk for dementia. During the study, more than 26,000 of the 440,000 participants, all with atrial fibrillation, were diagnosed with dementia.

At the time they joined the study, about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants, such as warfarin, Eliquis (apixaban), Pradaxa (dabigatran), Savaysa (edoxaban) or Xarelto (rivaroxaban).

The researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were 29 percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners.

When the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs, they found an even larger reduction (48 percent) in the risk for dementia. They also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation, the lower their risk for dementia.

Along with not taking blood thinners, the strongest predictors for dementia were age, Parkinson's disease and alcohol abuse, according to the study, published Oct. 25 in the European Heart Journal.

The findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation, but proving that would not be possible, the Swedish researchers said.

""In order to prove this assumption, randomized placebo-controlled trials would be needed, but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons,"" researchers Leif Friberg and Marten Rosenqvist, of the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, said in a journal news release. ""It is not possible to give placebo to [atrial fibrillation] patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur.""

However, the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs, Friberg noted.

""Patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate,"" he said. ""In the first year, approximately 15 percent stop taking the drugs, then approximately 10 percent each year.""

""If you know that [atrial fibrillation] eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment, I think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment,"" he said.

"The one-time infusion, known as CAR T-cell therapy, is made by Kite Pharma, which is based in Santa Monica, Calif., and recently was bought by Gilead Sciences for $11.9 billion. Kite announced Wednesday that the treatment's brand name will be Yescarta and its price will be $373,000.

AD

In late August, the FDA cleared the first CAR T-cell therapy, which is designed for children and young adults whose leukemia doesn't respond to standard treatments. About 600 patients in the United States fall into that category every year. Kymriah, which costs $475,000, is manufactured by Novartis.

AD

Biotech analysts had expected the Kite price to be lower than Kymriah's, in part because the number of eligible patients is larger and the response rates are lower. Even so, Yescarta's cost is likely to stoke the ongoing debate about high drug prices.

The FDA approval is the latest step forward for the fast-moving field of immunotherapy, which aims to bolster the immune system to attack malignancies. CAR T-cell therapies are among several approaches, along with treatments called checkpoint inhibitors and cancer vaccines, but they have recently grabbed much of the attention. Dozens of other companies also are working on them.

AD

“Today, marks another milestone in the development of a whole new scientific paradigm for the treatment of serious diseases,” FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb said in a statement, adding that the approval demonstrates “the continued momentum of this promising new area of medicine.”

AD

A CAR T-cell therapy involves a complicated and customized procedure in which T cells — sometimes called the foot soldiers of the immune system — are removed from the patient. They are sent to a special lab and genetically modified to target a protein on the surface of the patient's cancer cells. Once the modified cells are returned to the patient, their numbers expand exponentially as they become an army of cancer fighters.

Then they offered her a slot in Kite's clinical trial, a last-resort effort. “I could feel it when they put those T cells back in,” she said. “It was the craziest feeling in the world.” When she was checked a month later, she said, her cancer was gone. It hasn't returned.

AD

Kite's “vein-to-vein” turnaround period — from cell extraction to reinfusion — is about 17 days, according to Frederick Locke, an oncologist at Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa and co-leader of the Kite trial.

The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Yescarta were established in a multi-center trial of more than 100 adults with large B-cell lymphoma. An independent review committee found that 72 percent of patients treated with a single infusion responded to therapy, including 51 percent who then showed no evidence of remaining cancer. Kite has said that at six months, 44 percent of patients were still responding, with 39 percent having no sign of cancer.

AD

“This is not just an incremental benefit,” said David Chang, Kite's chief medical officer. “It raises the potential that a cure can be possible.” Some of the first patients who underwent treatment now have been in remission for three to five years, he said, although he cautioned that it's still too early to know whether those patients are cured.

AD

Locke said about 13 percent of patients in the trial had a severe side effect known as cytokine release syndrome, which produces high fevers, low blood pressure and other flulike symptoms. Twenty-eight percent had neurological “events,” such as severe confusion; three patients died of complications caused by the treatment.

“These are patients who knew they were out of options,” he said, noting that lymphoma patients who relapse or don't respond to treatment have just a 50 percent chance of surviving for six months.

AD

Because of the side effects, the treatment will carry a boxed warning, the FDA's most serious. In addition, the agency is requiring hospitals and clinics that dispense Yescarta to be certified after undergoing special training.

Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults. This type of cancer begins in the immune system and can be fast- or slow-growing, the FDA noted.

AD

Kite's CAR T-cell product was developed years ago at the National Cancer Institute by pioneering scientist Steven Rosenberg and licensed to the company for commercialization.

Armin Ghobadi, an oncologist at Siteman who was an investigator in the Kite trial, said the new treatment is “just the first step” and that researchers are working to make it safer and more effective. He said the therapy already has been life-changing for many of his patients — and for him.

“There's nothing worse than telling patients, 'I'm sorry, we are done here, we don't have anything else to offer,' "" he said.

THURSDAY, Oct. 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among women in the United States, and routine screenings remain the most reliable way to detect the disease early, a breast cancer expert says.

""Breast cancer can be treated more successfully if detected in its early phases, while it is small and has not yet spread,"" said Dr. Kathryn Evers, director of mammography at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ""With today's state-of-the-art treatment options and less extensive surgery, patients are experiencing better outcomes.""

Older age is a leading risk factor for breast cancer. Most women are diagnosed after the age of 50. Having certain mutations in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes also predispose women to the disease. And there are some lifestyle-related risk factors that can be controlled, such as hormone therapy after menopause, obesity, alcohol intake and physical inactivity, Evers said.

""Having one risk factor or even several doesn't mean a woman will definitely develop breast cancer,"" she said in a Fox Chase news release. ""Women need to become educated about the risk factors, especially those they can control, and then adjust their lifestyle accordingly.""

Not all women with breast cancer experience the same warning signs of the disease. Symptoms of breast cancer may include:

A lump in the breast or armpit.

Swelling or thickening in part of the breast.

Dimpling or irritation of the skin on the breast.

Pain in the breast that doesn't go away.

Redness or flaky skin on the breast or nipple.

Unusual nipple discharge.

A change in the size or shape of the breast.

In some cases, women never develop any of these symptoms, Evers noted.

""All women should know how their breasts look and feel so they can recognize any changes in them. This is an important part of breast health,"" she said. ""But just being familiar with your breasts should never take the place of regular screenings and mammograms. These tests can help find breast cancer in its early stages, even before symptoms appear.""

There are three tests often used to look for breast cancer, Evers said.

Mammogram: An X-ray of the breast used to examine breast changes. Its effectiveness depends on the size of a breast tumor and the density of breast tissue. Three-dimensional (3D) mammography involves X-ray machines that take pictures of thin slices of the breast from different angles, to build a 3D image.

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Oct. 9, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit -- staving off urinary tract infections, a new study reports.

Young women plagued by UTIs who drank an additional 6 cups of water each day were nearly half -- 48 percent -- as likely as a control group to have another infection, the study showed.

The water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half -- or 47 percent.

What's more, the amount of time that passed before a woman's next UTI and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group.

Women are more prone to UTIs than men, partly due to their anatomy. A shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder.

Study author Dr. Thomas Hooton said it's thought that increasing fluid intake decreases UTI risk in two ways: by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection.

""Flushing bacteria out of the bladder, it's been known, at least it's been thought, that it is protective. This study suggests that it is,"" said Hooton, clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the University of Miami School of Medicine.

Dr. Hunter Wessells, who wasn't involved in the study, called the additional fluid intake ""substantial,"" leading to a corresponding increase in urine output.

""It is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study,"" said Wessells, chair of the department of urology at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle.

Dr. Susan Bleasdale, medical director of infection control at the University of Illinois at Chicago, said the study ""may be a game changer"" for antibiotic ""stewardship"" programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use.

She cited a 2010 review estimating that 11 million to 12 million women a year will suffer from a UTI, accounting for 1.6 billion antibiotic prescriptions a year.

""We might not even need to use antibiotics,"" she said.

The study, conducted in Bulgaria, involved 140 healthy premenopausal women who had at least three UTIs in the past year. All reported low daily fluid intake. They drank roughly four cups of fluid per day, including just 2 cups of water a day.

Half of the women in the study were asked to consume 1.5 liters of water, or about 6 cups, each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake. Specifically, they were asked to begin drinking a 1/2-liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal.

The remaining women served as a control group. They continued their usual fluid intake.

The women were followed for a year, with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as 6 and 12 months later. Researchers measured their water and fluid intake; urine volume, frequency and concentration; and symptoms. They also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing UTI symptoms.

Overall, the water group increased daily water intake by close to 5 cups a day. Their total daily fluid intake, including water and other beverages, averaged nearly 12 cups.

By contrast, the control group's total daily fluid intake was less than half of that.

Hooton noted that it's not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit.

""There's no magic in a liter-and-a-half,"" he said.

Likewise, he believes any increase in fluid -- not just water -- may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water. And while the study involved younger women, he said older women who experience recurrent UTIs may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well.

Whether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output, however, is unclear, Wessells noted.

""In addition, the bother associated with the higher urine output, and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages, requires further study as well,"" he said.

Researchers presented the findings Saturday at IDWeek 2017, the annual meeting of the Infectious Diseases Society of America, the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America, the HIV Medicine Association and the Pediatric Infectious Diseases Society.

Research presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed publication.

"Regular exercise may prevent many cases of future depression, according to a new Australian study, and researchers say that as little as one hour a week can make a real difference.

The paper, published in the American Journal of Psychiatry, followed more than 22,000 healthy Norwegian adults without symptoms of anxiety or depression for an average of 11 years, asking them about their exercise habits and symptoms of depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of the study.

At the start, about 12% said they didn’t exercise, and the rest said they exercised anywhere from “up to 30 minutes” to “more than 4 hours” a week.

Over the next decade, about 7% of people in the study developed depression, and about 9% developed anxiety. No relationship was observed between exercise and later anxiety, but the researchers did find a link between exercise and later depression.

People who said they didn’t exercise at the study’s start were 44% more likely to become depressed, compared to those who exercised at least 1 to 2 hours a week. For people who worked out more, no additional benefits were observed.

The study could not prove a cause-and-effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression, but the authors say it strongly suggests one—especially because they controlled for other potential factors, including age, gender, social support, smoking, drinking and body mass index.

If their hypothesis is right, they say, 12% of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week.

That exercise doesn’t have to be intense, either, they say. People seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat.

MORE: 7 Surprising Benefits of Exercise

“Given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important,” the authors wrote in their paper, “it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities, such as walking or cycling.”

Of course, there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise. Both the American Heart Association and the World Health Organization recommend getting at least 150 minutes of moderate- to high-intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health.

But when it comes to mental health benefits, “the majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week,” said study author Samuel Harvey, associate professor of workplace mental health at the Black Dog Institute and the University of New South Wales, in an email.

MORE: A New Hope For Depression

The authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression. It’s also possible, they add, that exercise may trigger changes in self-esteem, the release of mood-boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins.

“There is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression, though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression, like medication and counseling,” says Harvey. “Our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place.”

"A new genetic testing kit that hits the market today is the most affordable, and arguably one of the simplest, ways for women to find out if they have an increased risk of developing breast cancer.

Here is what women should know about BRCA gene mutation testing, including how it works, who should actually consider getting it and the new convenient test that one woman already credits for helping detect her cancer early.

What are the BRCA genes?

The two BRCA genes (BRCA1 and BRCA2) normally help protect women from cancer, however, some women may have mutations to their BRCA genes, which can actually lead to cancer, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

If untreated, women with a BRCA gene mutation are seven times more likely to get breast cancer, and 30 times more likely to get ovarian cancer before the age of 70, when compared with women without the gene mutations, according to the CDC.

Should everyone take a BRCA gene test?

Medical professionals say no.

The BRCA test is ""absolutely not recommended for every single person,"" according to Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News chief women's health correspondent.

She identified the criteria doctors want people to meet before being tested for BRCA, including:

1) A family history of someone having a positive BRCA mutation.

2) Ovarian cancer at any age in the family.

3) Breast cancer before the age of 50.

4) Triple-negative breast cancer before the age of 60.

5) Male breast cancer in the family at any age.

6) People of Ashkenazi Jewish ancestry.

7) People who have had two or more cases of breast cancer, one occurring before the age of 50, on their mother’s or father’s side of the family.

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) recommends against routine BRCA gene testing for women who do not have a family history associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the BRCA genes, the group of preventative care experts wrote on their website.

The USPSTF does, however, recommend that women who have family members with breast, ovarian, tubal or peritoneal cancer should receive genetic counseling, and BRCA testing if recommended after counseling.

The Color BRCA gene test

Color

While the new Color BRCA genetic mutation test is not the only BRCA genetic test on the market, at $149 it is currently the cheapest, making gene testing more accessible to all women.

The Color test must be ordered by a physician, either through your own doctor, or an independent physician through the company. Users are asked to send a saliva sample -- which carries your D.N.A. -- to their lab, where it is analyzed. Results are then sent back to the user online in three to four weeks.

Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice, a women's health researcher at the Morehouse School of Medicine in Atlanta, Georgia, told ABC News that ""one in eight [women] will get breast cancer in their lifetime.""

""So it's very important the women who are high-risk, we want them to have access to the test, and many of us believe [the price] makes it more affordable,"" Montgomery Rice said.

Devon Gant told ABC News that she used the Color test to find out that she tested positive for the BRCA 2 gene mutation.

ABC News

""It's kind of a black cloud,"" Gant said. ""It's this thing that's kind of looming in the future.""

Gant said that although there were times when she struggled with the test results, ""it's not a death sentence.""

When her aunt, Lauren Rossi, took a Color test and also got a positive result for a BRCA mutation, doctors sent Rossi for an MRI, she said.

ABC News

""That's when they found a couple of spots, said they didn't really think it was anything,"" Rossi told ABC News. ""And it came back that it was cancer.""

Rossi said that when she received the phone call she ""couldn't believe it.""

In part due to the genetic test, and the early detection, Rossi says she is now cancer-free.

""Thank God,"" she told ABC News. ""It would've been a totally different outcome, probably next February, when I went for, you know, for my mammography.""

She said that she is grateful that both she and Gant were tested for the BRCA gene mutation because it helped doctors detect cancer in her, and it empowers her niece with knowledge about her health.

""Now she knows,"" Rossi said of her niece. ""And she knows what she needs to do, and she'll stay healthy.""

'Window into the future'

Ashton describes genetic testing as showing a ""possible window into the future.""

""It doesn’t mean a guarantee because we know that genes are just one part of what determines someone’s future health risks,"" she said. ""Behavior and environment are also important.""

People should also be aware that it is possible now to test for over 30 gene mutations associated with different types of hereditary cancer, according to Ashton. Eight of those gene mutations are associated with breast cancer.

""While all the attention goes on BRCA, it is important for people to know they can have a gene mutation in other genes and it is readily available now to test for this,"" she said. ""This is a mainstream option which I think is good news for some people.""",1
"Is it time for you to begin screening for colorectal cancer? Screening looks for signs of cancer in someone who doesn't have any symptoms. The idea is that by catching cancer early, before it spreads, it's easier to treat.

Stool Screening Tests

One way to look for signs of colorectal cancer is to see if there are microscopic amounts of blood in the stool using a high-sensitivity fecal occult blood test, or FOBT. Occult, in this case, means hidden. ""It's an indirect indicator the patient could be harboring polyps [precancerous growths in the colon],"" says Dr. Sreeram Maddipatla, medical oncologist/hematologist for the Liver Center and Pancreas Center at UF Health Cancer Center – Orlando Health. Although blood in the stool can mean there's a tumor or polyps, it can also be a sign of something much less serious, like hemorrhoids.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has approved two types of fecal occult blood tests and one stool DNA test:

Guaiac FOBT. This was the first stool test for colorectal screening, says Dr. Robin Mendelsohn, a gastroenterologist at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center. Mendelsohn says the concept for the guaiac FOBT originated from the idea that colon cancer bled into the colon and then into the stool. Guaiac FOBT detects heme – an iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen – in the stool. The guaiac FOBT is not specific to human heme, Mendelsohn says, so if you consume meat before the test, it could affect the results.

To do a guaiac FOBT, you'll use a kit to collect stool from three different bowel movements and send the samples to a lab for analysis. ""[The need for three samples] is due to the intermittent nature of bleeding from a tumor,"" Mendelsohn says. If you choose this method of colorectal screening, you'll need to repeat the test yearly.

When a guaiac FOBT is performed every one to two years in adults 50 to 80 years old, it can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by 15 to 33 percent, according to the National Cancer Institute.

Fecal immunochemical test, or FIT. The FIT detects human hemoglobin, Maddipatla says. It doesn't react to non-human blood, so there are no dietary restrictions prior to the test. Maddipatla says this test is easier than the guaiac FOBT, as it only requires one stool sample (which must be mailed back to the lab right away for an accurate result). Although other conditions, such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed, can produce a positive result, the FIT produces fewer false positives than the guaiac FOBT, Maddipatla says, and is almost equal to colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer. The FIT is approximately 80 percent sensitive for detecting cancer and 20 to 30 percent sensitive for detecting advanced polyps. ""The colonoscopy is still the gold standard,"" Maddipatla says.

Unlike a colonoscopy – a visual examination of the full length of the colon and rectum – the guiaic FOBT and FIT only detect cancers or polyps. A colonoscopy can help prevent cancer by removing polyps before they have a chance to develop into a tumor.

Many patients prefer the simplicity of stool testing to undergoing a colonoscopy. However, if you have a positive result with either a guaiac FOBT or FIT, you may have polyps or colon cancer, and you'll need to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy, Mendelsohn says. ""There's no point in doing [stool tests] if you're not willing to do a colonoscopy afterwards.""

FIT-DNA. You may have seen advertisements for the Cologuard FIT-DNA test. According to the NCI, Cologuard detects both tiny amounts of blood in the stool (the FIT portion) as well as nine biomarkers in three genes that have been found in colorectal cancer and advanced polyps. The NCI says for average-risk adults who didn't have symptoms, the FIT-DNA test detected more cancers and adenomas (advanced polyps) than the FIT, but had more false positives.

Mendelsohn says there are no long-term studies on FIT-DNA, so doctors aren't sure how frequently patients should undergo it. Medicare reimburses for the test every three years, she says, and depending on the manufacturer, the guidelines recommend repeating the test every one to three years. Mendelsohn says she is uncomfortable with the rate of false positives, which is about 10 to 13 percent. As with the guiaic FOBT and the FIT, a positive result means you still need to undergo a colonoscopy.

The Bottom Line

Adults at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin colorectal screening at age 50. Talk to your doctor about which test is right for you.

The Affordable Care Act and Medicare cover screening for colorectal cancer. Check with your insurer about which tests are covered and what your out-of-pocket costs might be.",1
"Longest study of its kind concludes current prescribing guidelines are correct, and that statins show impressive benefits for men with high cholesterol levels

This article is more than 2 years old

This article is more than 2 years old

Statins cut the risk of dying from heart disease by 28% among men, according to the longest study of its kind.

The 20-year project examined data from 2,560 men taking part in a randomised clinical trial to test the effects of statins versus a placebo.

All the men had very high levels of LDL, or “bad” cholesterol, (higher than 4.9mmol/L) but had no evidence of heart disease at the start of the study.

Nearly all men over 60 and women over 75 eligible for statins, analysis suggests Read more

Researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Glasgow found impressive results among those on statins, who were given the widely-prescribed type pravastatin.

They found that compared with the placebo, there was a 27% reduced risk of coronary heart disease, a 28% reduced risk of dying from coronary heart disease, and a 25% reduced risk of coronary “events” such as a heart attack.

There was also an 18% reduced risk of dying from any cause over the 20-year period.

Senior author Professor Kausik Ray, from Imperial’s School of Public Health, said: “For the first time, we show that statins reduce the risk of death in this specific group of people who appear largely healthy except for very high LDL levels.

“This legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins.”

Ray said people with lower levels of cholesterol, around 4mmol/L, who otherwise appear healthy, should also be treated with statins.

Statins prevent 80,000 heart attacks and strokes a year in UK, study finds Read more

Ray added: “This is the strongest evidence yet that statins reduce the risk of heart disease and death in men with high LDL.

“Our study lends support to LDL’s status as a major driver of heart disease risk, and suggests that even modest LDL reductions might offer significant mortality benefits in the long-term.

“Our analysis firmly establishes that controlling LDL over time translates to fewer deaths in this population.”

Professor Sir Nilesh Samani, medical director at the British Heart Foundation, said: “This research further demonstrates the benefits of statins for people who have high levels of cholesterol in their blood.

“It shows the enduring and long-term benefit of taking statins, including the extent to which they reduce the risk of dying from heart disease, which can only be seen in a study of this length.

“The role of cholesterol in causing heart disease has been disputed by some, but this paper provides yet more evidence of the link, and the benefits of statins to prevent heart disease.”",1
"After years of growing doubt about the value of screening men for prostate cancer, a new analysis of existing clinical trial evidence has found that when men between 55 and 70 get the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, the result is lives saved.

In 2009, a New England Journal of Medicine editorialist famously called the debate over PSA testing for prostate cancer “the controversy that refuses to die.” That comment came with the publication of two clinical trials — one conducted in the United States, the second in Europe — that drew two contradictory conclusions on prostate cancer testing.

The U.S. undertaking, called the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCO) Trial, found that screening men for prostate cancer does not save lives. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer suggested that screening drove down the rate of deaths from prostate cancer by 20%.

In 2012, a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening American men for prostate cancer with the PSA test. And in April 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force dumped the decision squarely into the laps of patients and their doctors. Some men between 55 and 69 years of age might well decide to get their PSA checked, the task force said. After hearing the ledger of pros and cons, however, others in that age bracket might just as reasonably skip the screening test, the panel concluded.

Advertisement

The new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, now calls those recommendations into question. The authors of the study, led by biostatistician Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, concluded that screening men over age 55 “can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk for prostate cancer death.”

When men who fit the criteria for screening get the PSA test, the reduction in deaths due to prostate cancer was between 25% and 32%, the new study found.

But the newly published analysis also underscores that the value of prostate cancer screening rests heavily on which men you screen, where and for how long you conduct the clinical trial, and how you crunch the numbers.

In the end, said Vanderbilt University urological surgeon Dr. Sam Chang, the new analysis “reinforces what urological surgeons and treating physicians have thought all along: that PSA screening is helpful.”

Advertisement

But it is helpful, said Chang, only when it focuses on the right men — those between 55 and 70 — and when it is tempered by an understanding that not all worrisome findings are evidence of disease that should be treated aggressively.

Sometimes, said Chang, who was not involved in the newly published article, a man will get a problematic PSA test reading and decide not to act on it immediately or aggressively. But knowing there is a decision to be made is probably a better basis for planning than not knowing, he added.

“Over the past five to 10 years, there has been a better understanding by everyone about the harms of over-treatment,” Chang said. “You want to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment.”

Chang underscored that for two groups in particular — African American men and those with a first-degree relative who died of prostate cancer — knowing is especially important, because the risks of aggressive disease in such populations is much higher than for others. Neither group was the subject of special attention in the newly published analysis.

In an editorial published alongside the new analysis, Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center also made clear that it’s what patients and their physicians do after the PSA test that matters most.

“Unfortunately, the way screening has been implemented in the United States leaves much to be desired,” Vickers wrote. “The controversy about PSA-based screening should no longer be whether it can do good but whether we can change our behavior so that it does more good than harm,” he added.

Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer found in men, affecting 101.6 of 100,000 American men, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 176,000 got a diagnosis of prostate cancer and 28,000 died of it.

But a change in a man’s reading on the PSA test is a highly imperfect gauge of trouble: approximately 80% of positive PSA test results are thought to produce false-positives, creating scares that prompt men to get biopsies. And treatment, which carries with it a high risk of subsequent difficulties with sexual function, urination and bowel movements, is often unnecessary because prostate cancers are often so slow-growing they will never make a man sick.

Advertisement

As a result of this growing skepticism about whom to screen for prostate cancer and whether to treat it, more and more men are skipping the PSA test. And among those who get it and get back a worrisome finding, fewer and fewer are opting to treat it.

Earlier this year, a long-running clinical trial found no evidence that patients who got an early prostate cancer diagnosis and chose “active surveillance” (sometimes called watchful waiting) were no more likely to die of the disease than were men who got the same diagnosis and treated it aggressively.

"It turns out that cholesterol isn’t the only thing you have to worry about to keep your heart healthy. In recent years, doctors have started to focus on inflammation — the same process that makes cuts red and painful — as an important contributor to a heart attack. It’s the reason doctors recommend low-dose aspirin to prevent recurrent heart attacks in people who have already had them, why they also prescribe statins, which lower both cholesterol and inflammation, and why they have started to measure inflammation levels in the blood.

But it’s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. Since statins lower both, it’s hard to tell whether inflammation or cholesterol has the bigger impact on heart problems.

MORE: Why Inflammation in Your Mouth May Raise Your Risk of Cancer

But in a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting, scientists say they now have proof that lowering inflammation alone, without affecting cholesterol, also reduces the risk of a heart attack.

In the study, 10,000 people who have already had a heart attack were randomly assigned to get injected with a placebo or different doses of a drug called canakinumab. Canakinumab, made by Novartis, is currently approved to treat rare immune-related conditions and works to reduce inflammation but does not affect cholesterol levels. After four years, the people who received the drug had a 15% lower chance of having a heart attack or stroke compared to people who didn’t get the drug. The medication also reduced the need for angioplasty or bypass surgery by 30%.

“Even I am pinching myself,” says Dr. Paul Ridker, who led the study and is director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and is a pioneer in exposing the role inflammation plays in heart disease. “This outcome is more than we hoped for. The bottom line is we now have clear evidence that lowering inflammation through this pathway lowers rates of heart attack and stroke with no change at all in cholesterol.”

About a quarter of people who have heart attacks will have another heart event even if they keep their cholesterol at recommended levels. For them, it may not be cholesterol so much as inflammation that is driving their heart disease. So the study further solidifies the fact that heart doctors should be measure inflammation as well as cholesterol in their heart patients. An inexpensive blood test that looks for a protein that rises in the blood with inflammation, called C-reactive protein (CRP), can tell doctors how much inflammation their patients have. Beginning in 2003, the American Heart Association started to provide guidelines on how doctors should use CRP testing; for patients like those in the current trial, the group did not see any additional benefit to CRP testing since those patients should already be treated with statins, which can lower both cholesterol and inflammation.

But with the new results, those guidelines may change. Ridker says the findings should clarify how doctors can optimize the way they treat their heart patients — about half of people who have had a heart attack tend to have high levels of inflammatory factors, while half have high cholesterol levels. The inexpensive CRP test could identify those with higher inflammation, who might be candidates for taking a drug like canakinumab.

The drug is not currently approved for any heart conditions, but Novartis will likely look at doing more studies to confirm its effectiveness in treating heart disease.

Perhaps more intriguing are additional results that Ridker reported, related to cancer. In a separate study published in the Lancet using data from the same study, he found that people taking canakinumab lowered their risk of dying from any cancer over four years by 50%, and their risk of fatal lung cancer by 75%.

While the connection between heart disease and cancer may not seem obvious, Ridker says that many people who have had heart problems, like those in the study, are former or current smokers, since smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks. And smoking increases inflammation. “People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day are chronically inflaming their lungs,” he says. That’s why he decided to look at cancer deaths as well as heart events in his study population.

The cancer data is still preliminary, and needs to be confirmed with additional studies, but it’s encouraging, says Dr. Otis Bradley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study. “We know that free oxygen radicals and inflammation can damage DNA and can cause cancer,” he says. “This all makes sense to me.” Studies have already shown, for example, that inflammation may be a factor in prostate cancer and colon cancer.

But whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn’t clear yet. There are a number of different inflammatory pathways, and canakinumab targets just one. Other pathways, along with new anti-inflammatory drugs, may emerge with more research.

When it comes to heart disease, however, it’s clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment. “Ten years from now we will be doing more personalized medicine,” says Ridker. “Some people will get more cholesterol lowering. Some will get more inflammation-lowering drugs. Some will get other agents that we haven’t considered yet. It’s a wonderful new era in heart disease treatment.”

"(Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) said it had approved Adamas Pharmaceuticals Inc’s treatment for a side effect caused by a commonly prescribed Parkinson’s drug, sending the shares of the drugmaker soaring in after-market trading.

The company’s shares were up 30.9 percent at $18.84 after the bell on Thursday.

A majority of patients diagnosed with Parkinson’s are treated with levodopa, whose use often leads to dyskinesia - involuntary movements that are non-rhythmic, purposeless and unpredictable.

Parkinson’s disease is a debilitating disorder in which brain cells progressively die causing patients to experience tremors, rigidity, extreme slowness of movement, impaired balance, and difficulties in swallowing and speaking.

Adamas’ Gocovri, previously ADS-5102, is the first drug cleared by the FDA to control levodopa-induced dyskinesia (LID). The long-acting therapy is taken once-daily at bedtime.

An estimated 90 percent of levodopa-treated patients, about 200,000 people in the United States, suffer from LID, the company said.

Fluctuating levels of levodopa result in erratic periods of muscular control and involuntary movements throughout the day, disrupting activity at least half a dozen times a day.

As Parkinson’s progresses, patients are dyskinetic just after taking levodopa but increasingly exhibit “off time”, or worsening symptoms, as it wears off.

These patients have little recourse, other than opting for deep brain stimulation, a surgical procedure that involves blocking electrical signals from targeted areas in the brain.

With Gocovri, which targets both dyskinesia and off time, patients will be able to reclaim about 3.6 hours of their day, CEO Gregory Went said in an interview ahead of the decision.

About 50,000 people are diagnosed with Parkinson’s in the United States each year, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The main ingredient of Gocovri, amantadine, has been available in the market as an antiviral drug for several decades.

The company said the drug is expected to be available in the fourth quarter, and formally launched in January 2018.

Adamas is also testing the drug to treat walking impairment in patients with multiple sclerosis.",1
"When Heidi Imhof started losing her hair at 42, she also started losing sleep. Ms. Imhof, a lawyer, was afraid that blow-drying her straight dark hair would hasten the shedding, so she got up two hours early to shower and apply mousse and volumizers. When her hair finally air-dried, she’d pull it back, hoping to hide the bald patches on her scalp.

“I was desperate,” she said.

The hair thickening shampoo Nioxin didn’t help. Neither did Rogaine. Then she heard about Harklinikken, a Danish company offering a customized hair extract that’s given only to those who pass a fairly rigorous selection process.

Ms. Imhof, who lives in Land O’Lakes, Fla., was skeptical. The company’s before and after photos seemed too good to be true. But she went for a consultation and made the cut. (Harklinikken’s products are not available to anyone with autoimmune illnesses like alopecia or baldness from scarring, or anyone who is unlikely to see at least a 30 percent increase in growth.)

After three months of applying the $88-a-month serum, Ms. Imhof was so excited by the results that she overcame her embarrassment about the subject and posted her own before-and-after photos on Facebook.",1
"In a long-term study of the latest treatment for peanut allergy, scientists in Australia report that an immune-based therapy helped children allergic to peanuts eat them without reactions for four years.

The study, published in the journal Lancet Child & Adolescent Health, follows up on children enrolled in an earlier study of an immunotherapy treatment, which combined probiotics with small doses of peanuts that were designed to gradually train the children’s immune systems to accept the peanut allergen rather than treat it as something foreign. Previous studies have suggested that methods like these could be effective in reducing youngsters’ allergic, sometimes dangerous anaphylactic shock reactions to peanuts. The Australian team added probiotics to further enhance the gut’s ability to accept the peanuts and not trigger an immune reaction. Compared to 4% of children who didn’t get any treatment, 82% of those receiving the combination therapy significantly reduced their allergic reactions to peanuts.

MORE: Babies Should Eat Eggs and Peanuts Early to Avoid Food Allergies

In the follow-up, which tracked the children for four years after they were treated with the combination therapy, 67% of those who got the combination probiotic and peanut therapy were comfortable eating peanuts, compared to only 4% of those who did not get the treatment. Fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts, and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen.

The results are encouraging, allowing the children who were treated to eat peanuts without fear of an allergic reaction. But it may be too early to call this a cure. The researchers believe that adding probiotics to the peanut allergens may be important in improving the children’s tolerance to the food, but Dr. Anna Nowak-Wegrzyn, an associate professor of pediatrics at Icahn School of Medicine at Mt. Sinai Hospital who was not involved in the study, notes that the researchers didn’t compare the effect of the probiotics themselves; they only compared children who received the probiotics along with immune therapy to those who didn’t get any treatment at all.

It makes sense that the probiotics may enhance the immunotherapy’s effect, since probiotics are beneficial bacteria in the gut, where food allergens are processed. “I think there is certainly a suggestion, but not hard proof, that the probiotics make a difference,” says Nowak-Wegrzyn. “The question for me would be if there is a difference between patients who were treated with [both] immunotherapy [in the form of low doses of peanuts] and probiotics, and those who were treated with just immunotherapy.”

That may have to wait for another study. But the new findings provide even more evidence that using peanuts to treat peanut allergy, and to re-train the immune system to be less allergic, can be effective.

"It is the first new drug for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) in 22 years to become available in the United States. Called edaravone – brand name Radicava – its FDA approval this week was met with a wave of excitement from the media and the ALS community.

But some physicians are raising concerns over the cost of the drug and whether or not patients will be able to get it, as well as noting misconceptions about how effective at fighting this degenerative condition this drug will actually be.

Each year, doctors diagnose anywhere between 5,000 to 6,000 Americans with this rapidly progressive neurodegenerative disease, and the Centers for Disease Control estimates that 12,000 to 15,000 people at any given time in the U.S. live with the disease. The majority of these patients die within two to five years of diagnosis.

The FDA approval is based on a study of 137 people with ALS published earlier this year. Patients received either a placebo pill or edaravone over a six-month period. Researchers found that those getting edaravone had a 33 percent reduction in their rate of decline in physical function.

It’s a finding that inspires hope of slowing -- but not yet stopping or reversing -- the progression of this disease.

Dr. Leo McCluskey, who leads the University of Pennsylvania’s ALS Center and was not involved in the study nor in the approval of this drug, said the findings are promising but he added that he fears they could be misinterpreted.

“Thirty percent is pretty robust,” McCluskey said. But he nonetheless added, “We have patients calling our center asking for the cure to ALS, and this is not a cure.”

And then there is the price tag. According to MT Pharma America, the company behind Radicava, the cost is around $1,000 per infusion – and treatment, which involves multiple infusions, may total about $146,000 per year.

“This is just for the drug; you also need a nurse and infusion equipment,” McCluskey said. “We don’t know who is going to cover it or what criteria will be used to decide who gets it.”

McCluskey also expressed concerns about the feasibility of ALS patients with reduced mobility going to receive daily infusions. “Imagine you’re a patient with difficulty moving around, and you now have to come in every day to receive infusions.”

And the number of infusions needed means many such trips. Edaravone is administered by an intravenous infusion over 60 minutes in 28-day cycles. The initial cycle involves a daily infusion for two weeks, followed by a two-week period without infusions. Additional cycles consist of infusions for 10 days over two weeks followed by two-week drug-free periods.

In an interview with ABC News, Tom Larson, the chief commercial officer for MT Pharma America, said the company is already taking steps to streamline the process for obtaining Radicava. The company has set up a system called Searchlight, through which patients and physicians can apply for the drug, obtain benefits information, identify an infusion center and schedule an infusion. Larson said the company has partnered with over 1,100 infusion centers across the country in an effort to “make this as easy and accessible to patients as possible.”

As for the costs and coverage of the drug, Larson said insurance companies are still deciding whether they will pay for Radicava. “We are in the process every new pharmaceutical goes through as payers make a decision.”

"Flattening The 'Mummy Tummy' With 1 Exercise, 10 Minutes A Day

Enlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR

I admit it. I have a ""mummy tummy,"" also known as ""mommy pooch."" You know, that soft jelly belly you retain after having a baby — it makes you look a few months pregnant.

I've tried to convince myself that the pooch is a valiant badge of motherhood, but who am I kidding? The pooch bothers me. And it turns out it has been causing back pain.

So when I hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily, I think, ""Why not?""

A few weeks later, I'm rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in San Francisco.

""We will see a dramatic change,"" says Leah Keller, who leads the class.

""You can easily expect to see 2 inches off your waist in three weeks of time,"" Keller says. ""That's not an unrealistic expectation.""

We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises.""

Decked out in purple yoga pants and leather cowboy boots, Keller is a personal trainer from New York City. She has developed an exercise that allegedly shrinks the mommy pooch.

There is science to back up the method, she says.

""A doctor at Weill Cornell and I did a study on the exact same program we're going to do,"" Keller says. ""And we found 100 percent of women achieved full resolution.""

OK! Wait a second. Two inches off my belly in three weeks? That sounds too good to be true. I decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and Keller's claim.

Putting the six-pack back together

It turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name: diastasis recti, which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles.

And it's quite common. Last year, a study from Norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth.

""This is such a ubiquitous issue,"" says Dr. Geeta Sharma, an OB-GYN at Weill Cornell Medical Center-New York Presbyterian Hospital.

And it's not just a cosmetic problem. Diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms: lower back pain.

""People can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened,"" Sharma says.

The Diastasis Recti During pregnancy, the abdominal muscles responsible for a ""six pack"" stretch apart (left) to accommodate a growing fetus. After birth, the muscles don't always bounce back, leaving a gap known as the mommy pooch.

How To Test For Diastasis Recti There's a simple way to see whether you have diastasis recti: Lie flat on your back with your knees bent. Put your fingers right above your belly button and press down gently. Then lift up your head about an inch while keeping your shoulders on the ground. If you have diastasis recti, you will feel a gap between the muscles that is wider than an inch.

In rare occasions, the tissue in the abdomen isn't just stretched, but it is also torn a bit. This can cause a hernia, Sharma says.

""If there's a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba, then the bowel can poke through,"" Sharma says. ""That's going to be more dangerous.""

A hernia may require surgery. ""So I will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a CT scan if there's really a true concern about a hernia,"" Sharma says.

Diastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart — specifically the rectus abdominal muscles.

""These are the muscles that give you a 'six pack,' "" says Dr. Linda Brubaker, an OB-GYN at the University of California, San Diego. ""People think these muscles go horizontal across the belly. But they actually go vertical from head to toe.""

The rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other, on either side of the belly button, Brubaker says. ""There shouldn't be much of gap between them.""

But during pregnancy, a gap opens up between the muscles, right around the belly button. Sometimes that gap closes on its own, but other times, it stays open.

That leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs, a spot that can be 1 to 2 inches wide. That lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out — and cause mommy pooch.

To flatten the area, women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign. And that is where the exercises come into play.

If you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti, you'll turn up a deluge of exercise routines, all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together.

But the quality of much of that information isn't good, Brubaker says. ""Some of it is actually potentially harmful.""

Even some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti, says Keller, including simple crunches.

""You have to be very careful,"" she says. ""For example, please don't ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches. They splay your abs apart in so many ways.""

That said, there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support. These include the Tupler Technique, Keller's Dia Method and the MuTu System in the U.K.

Most such courses, taught once a week for an hour in New York, San Francisco and at least a few other places, tend to run about four to 12 weeks and cost around $100 to $300. Some places offer online classes and videos, which are much less expensive.

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period. But the organization's guidelines don't provide details — such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long.

Plus, ACOG focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem; it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy.

toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR

""The best way is prevention,"" says Dr. Raul Artal, an OB-GYN at St. Louis University, who helped ACOG write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period. ""The best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy.""

But, as Sharma, the Cornell OB-GYN, points out, no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti.

""There's a general knowledge that exercise is going to help,"" Sharma says. ""But no one has really tested them in a standardized way.""

In fact, the few studies that have been done haven't been high enough quality to draw conclusions, researchers in Australia said a few years ago.

Sharma hopes to change that. A few years ago, she teamed up with Keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique.

""We did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women,"" Sharma says.

The study was small — just 63 women. But the results were quite promising. After 12 weeks of doing Keller's exercise — 10 minutes a day — all the women had fixed their diastasis recti, Sharma and Keller reported at ACOG's annual meeting few years ago.

""We had patients that were even one year out from giving birth, and they still had such great benefit from the exercises,"" Sharma says. ""We love to see that there is something we can do to help women.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Talia Herman for NPR Talia Herman for NPR

Now Sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well.

Tight and tighter

Back at the class in San Francisco, Keller is taking us moms through the key exercise. It's surprisingly simple to do.

""The exercise is a very small, very intense movement that's almost imperceptible,"" Keller says. ""OK. We're going to do another set.""

Sitting on the floor cross-legged, with our hands on our bellies, we all take a big breath. ""Let the belly fully expand,"" Keller says.

And then as we exhale, we suck in our belly muscles — as far back as they'll go, toward the spine. ""Now we're going to stay here near the spine. Hold this position,"" she says.

Then we take tiny breaths. With each exhale, we push our stomachs back further and further.

""Tight, tighter,"" Keller chants, rhythmically.

You can do the exercise in several different positions, Keller says: sitting crossed-legged, sitting on your knees, standing with knees slightly bent, on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position.

The key is to be sure your back is flat, and that you do the exercise 10 minutes each day, changing positions every two minutes or so. For the rest of the time, your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine.

""The fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason,"" she says. ""So you know that you're squeezing tight, tighter with the belly, and you're never bulging the bellybutton forward.""

This is our fourth week of class, and we've been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least 10 minutes. So it's judgment day. Time to see whether we've flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti.

Keller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women's middles. She also has us lie down on the floor, so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles.

One by one, there is success after success. Several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations. Many lost inches from their bellies.

One woman had amazing results. ""Oh my goodness, you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference,"" Keller exclaims. ""That's amazing!""

How did I fare? Well, after three weeks, I didn't completely close up the abdominal separation. My separation decreased from 1.2 inches to 0.8 inches.* But I did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference.

And I am quite happy with the results. My abs are definitely firmer. And regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit: My lower back pain has almost completely gone away.

*I continued to do the exercises after the class had finished. I checked with in Keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti. At that point, the separation had dropped down to 0.6 inches, which meant technically I no longer have diastasis recti.",1
"Scientists Edge Closer To Elusive Lab Test For Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Enlarge this image toggle caption Malte Mueller/Getty Images Malte Mueller/Getty Images

Imagine feeling horribly sick, day after day, yet doctors repeatedly tell you they can't find anything wrong. That typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Research findings from Stanford University released Monday could point the way to a long-sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition, and possibly a first-ever treatment.

Believed to affect at least a million people in the U.S., the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME/CFS for short.

Many patients see the name ""chronic fatigue syndrome"" as trivializing and misleading, giving the impression that they're simply tired or depressed. In fact, they're experiencing profound exhaustion that isn't relieved with sleep, flu-like symptoms, muscle pain, ""brain fog"" and various other physical symptoms, all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion. (A 2015 Institute of Medicine report proposed the name ""systemic exertion intolerance disease,"" but it hasn't really stuck.)

The symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe, with about a quarter of patients so ill they're mostly or completely confined to bed. Now, the Stanford researchers have linked ME/CFS to variations in certain cytokines, immune-signaling proteins, that track with illness severity. The study results were published online Monday in the the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

The link to gradation in severity, rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result, represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness. The study involved 192 ME/CFS patients and 392 healthy controls matched for age and sex. Out of 51 cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence-based testing, only two of the cytokines differed, in their total concentrations, between the ME/CFS and control groups.

But, levels of 17 of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe ME/CFS symptoms. Of those 17 cytokines, 13 were types that promote inflammation. This is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness.

""This is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception, where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease. These data clearly show the contrary, and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology,"" lead author Dr. Jose Montoya, professor of infectious diseases at Stanford, tells Shots.

According to Dr. Anthony L. Komaroff, a Harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study, ""For many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of ME/CFS might be caused by cytokines, molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body. Past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms.""

What the latest research shows, Komaroff tells Shots, is that ""levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms: The higher the blood level, the worse the symptoms. That supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms.""

So why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in ME/CFS patients? Simply put, Montoya says, those tests aren't measuring the right things.

Two classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate — the ability of red blood cells to clump together, which isn't a factor in ME/CFS — and C-reactive protein, which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn't one of those linked to severity in this study.

""Inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures,"" Montoya says. ""We're showing an inflammation that has not been seen before.""

The multidisciplinary Stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially, that would test for around five of the 17 cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results. Such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients' responses to treatment.

What's more, the findings also point to possible treatment with immune-modifying or anti-inflammatory therapy. Montoya hopes that by publishing these findings ""a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation. We hope drug companies will pursue it.""

Indeed, a major drug trial is now being conducted in Norway investigating whether the immune-modifying drug rituximab alleviates ME/CFS symptoms, after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients. Interestingly, the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non-Hodgkin lymphoma, a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with ME/CFS.

Komaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the National Institutes of Health, which has included a comprehensive in-house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition.

And in an ongoing privately funded study, Stanford geneticist Ron Davis and a team including three Nobel laureates is taking a similar ""big data"" approach to investigate a group of ME/CFS patients who are all severely ill, including Davis' own adult son.

""There is much to learn,"" Komaroff writes, in the journal. ""Hopefully, a decade from now, ""doctors will know better what to measure and, more importantly, what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness.""

"Alzheimer’s disease now affects an estimated 5.5 million Americans, and after decades of feverish work, researchers have so far failed to find a treatment that halts or reverses the inexorable loss of memory, function and thinking ability that characterize this feared illness.

But researchers have been quite successful at devising ways to diagnose Alzheimer’s earlier and earlier. And that capability has emerged alongside evidence of a tantalizing possibility: that if you can catch the disease early enough — ideally when symptoms of confusion or memory loss are just emerging, or before — some therapies already in hand might essentially halt its progress.

For anyone who detects some mental slippage and wonders, “Is it Alzheimer’s?” the current state of dementia research raises a very real, and very wrenching, dilemma: If I can know, do I want to know?

That is, if it’s Alzheimer’s disease, would I do anything differently? Would there be some benefit in knowing for my loved ones, for myself?

Advertisement

Doctors and insurers, including the federal government, which administers Medicare, are asking some variants of the same questions: If an effective test, which costs between $3,000 and $5,000 a shot, can diagnose dementia early, and distinguish Alzheimer’s from other forms of dementia, should it be recommended to patients with cognitive concerns and routinely covered by their insurance? Would it make patients’ lives better, or lower the cost of their care?

Newly unveiled research results are bringing some clarity to such deliberations. And other new research, published Wednesday in the journal Neurology, proposes a new diagnostic tool that may be able to detect Alzheimer’s, and distinguish it from another form of dementia, more simply and cheaply than does the best test now available.

At the Alzheimer’s Assn. International Conference in London last week, researchers reported their preliminary findings from a trial that is testing the impact of diagnostic testing for Alzheimer’s disease on nearly 19,000 Medicare beneficiaries.

All of these study participants — largely people in their 70s, all with a diagnosis of either “mild cognitive impairment” or atypical dementia — are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have Alzheimer’s. The study is underwritten by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and the Alzheimer’s Assn. It set out to find out whether knowing — getting the costly test that would offer either confirmation or reprieve — would change the way that patients with cognitive troubles are treated, or the way that they plan their lives.

The preliminary results suggested it did. After getting the results of a PET brain scan to detect and measure amyloid deposits, which are the key hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease, roughly two-thirds of the subjects saw their medication regimens changed or were counseled differently by their doctors about what to expect.

That new information may have guided family caregivers in planning their own futures, or prodded patients to make financial decisions and power-of-attorney assignments sooner. Some who learned that they did not have Alzheimer’s discontinued medications that can have unpleasant side effects. Others learned they do have Alzheimer’s and decided to enroll in clinical trials that will test new drugs.

A second study presented in London analyzed data from several studies, and found that in a large population of research participants with cognitive concerns, brain amyloid PET scans led to a change in diagnosis in approximately 20% of cases.

“People should know what’s coming,” said Dr. Maria Carrillo, chief science officer for the Alzheimer’s Assn. The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services has given amyloid scans a provisional approval, meaning they do not routinely pay for them. The results may guide the agency to rethink its position, she added.

The PET scan bore bad news for Ken Lehmann, who enrolled last year in the IDEAS trial, short for Imaging Dementia — Evidence for Amyloid Scanning. After his long, slow decline that has flummoxed doctors, Lehmann’s brain scan clearly showed he has Alzheimer’s disease.

The certainty that has brought has been a long time coming. When Lehmann began withdrawing from friends, forgetting to pay bills and having trouble following conversations, he was just 58. Now, he’s 80.

Ken had always been considered a “Renaissance man” — a furniture company executive who rebuilt Porsches, played basketball and loved to entertain friends, said his wife, Mary Margaret Lehmann. But as years passed, his judgment seemed off. He would lose track of points he was making, and sometimes of where he was at.

It would take the loss of their home and a business bankruptcy for the Lehmanns to demand answers to what was going on. In 2009, they moved from Sacramento to Edina, Minn., to live with a daughter. And there, at last, they found a neurologist who, despite initial skepticism (“but he presents so well!” the doctor proclaimed), diagnosed dementia.

For the Lehmanns and many patients and families like them — as well as for neurologists — that diagnosis is often just the beginning of a deeper mystery.

Alzheimer’s disease is the most feared and most common form of dementia, accounting for between 60% and 80% of all dementia cases diagnosed. But at least seven other forms of dementia, and dementia linked to the movement disorder Parkinson’s disease, can cause loss of memory, reasoning, judgment and the ability to speak, comprehend and care for oneself.

To the estimated 16 million Americans living with some form of cognitive impairment, telling the difference could make a significant difference. Dementia forms with different origins progress differently (or sometimes not at all). They respond best to different medications, and will come to require different levels of care and treatment. Some (though not Alzheimer’s) can even be reversed with treatment.

Being able to distinguish which form of dementia a patient has should help doctors and caregivers to make better choices.

But it’s a question that until recently could be answered only after death. At that point, a postmortem examination of the brain could be done to look for the built-up clumps and tangles of beta-amyloid proteins, the overall shrinkage, and the loss of neurons in the brain’s hippocampus that are, collectively, the hallmarks of Alzheimer’s.

No more. Improved medical imaging technologies developed over the last decade have made it possible to peer inside the brain of a living patient, detect and measure the accumulation of beta-amyloid, and make a definitive diagnosis.

In 2012, the Food and Drug Administration took a first step in making such imaging possible, giving its blessing to the imaging agent florbetapir F18, which binds to amyloid aggregates in the brain and allows a PET scan to be used to make the diagnosis. In 2013, two new imaging agents won FDA approval, and new imaging agents and techniques promise ever more precise means to visualize and diagnose Alzheimer’s in the brain.

On Wednesday, research published in the journal Neurology suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation, a technique that can selectively turn up or down activity in different parts of the brain, could prove useful in distinguishing between Alzheimer’s disease from frontotemporal dementia.

In many ways, Ken Lehmann’s symptoms fit neatly into a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia. A form of cognitive impairment that typically becomes evident earlier than most cases of Alzheimer’s, FTD often affects judgment, personality and verbal communication. This form of dementia progresses as inexorably as does Alzheimer’s. But its typical course differs slightly.

As an enrollee in the IDEAS trial, Lehmann was prepared to learn what it was he had.

“I had come to the conclusion they just don’t know,” said Lehmann, now 80, from his home in Minnesota. “In seven years, my journey of decline has been very miniscule, and they don’t know why.”

It turns out, he added, “I have all the biomarkers of Alzheimer’s disease.”

Once he and his wife learned that, they stepped up their preparations for further decline. And they redoubled their efforts to do things that bring joy, and that may slow Ken’s decline as well.

They follow a diet rich in fatty fish, healthful fats and fruits and vegetables, and Ken does woodworking. He also sings in a Minneapolis chorus, Giving Voice, with other dementia patients. He has regained a long-lost ability to read music.

“Just not knowing is very disconcerting,” says Mary Margaret, who is her husband’s principal caregiver. “I don’t know what the timeline is, but I now know what the needs are, in terms of financial and legal needs and end-of-life issues. Those all need to be planned for ahead of time, and now we have all of that in place. To me, that’s a safety net.”

"Beyond The Nasty Needle: Trying To Make Vaccines More Comfy And Convenient

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of Georgia Institute of Technology Courtesy of Georgia Institute of Technology

News this summer of a flu vaccine patch sparked a lot of chatter. Could getting vaccinated be as easy as putting on a bandage? Could there be fewer, or at least smaller, needles in our future?

Some companies and academic labs are working to make those things happen.

They're refining technologies that involve tiny needles, less than a millimeter long, and needle-free injectors that can send a dose of vaccine through your skin in a fraction of a second.

Some of these technologies are already available on the market, while others are still being tested.

One hundred very tiny needles

A flu vaccine patch is not yet available to the public. But one version developed by Georgia Tech's Laboratory for Drug Delivery showed promising results in its first human clinical trial, according to a study published in The Lancet in June.

The patch, about the size of a small square bandage, has tiny, dissolvable needles filled with a dose of flu vaccine. It's placed on the arm and activated through pressure. The microneedles dissolve into the skin, releasing the vaccine.

In the study, 100 participants received either the flu vaccine patch, a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch.

Six months later, no one involved in the study had gotten the flu. People in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness, itching and tenderness but no serious side effects.

People who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot.

About 70 percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot, says Yasmine Gomaa, the lab's associate director.

Now, Gomaa's lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine. She says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn't need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines. It can be stored at temperatures as high as 104 degrees Fahrenheit for up to a year, she says.

And the patch can be administered by people who aren't trained health professionals. A number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves.

In 2015, Georgia Tech and the pharmaceutical company Micron Biomedical won $2.5 million in grants from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation to develop a patch for polio immunization.

Gomaa's hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now.

A 2016 study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste. Its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under $1, while a typical shot would cost $1.65. But that didn't take into account the costs of getting the patch to market.

The potential cost savings wouldn't happen until the patches were in ""routine use,"" the CDC noted.

A twist on Star Trek technology

Others in the vaccine-delivery business are taking a different approach, using a new twist on a needle-free device called a jet injector that has been around for more than half a century.

Star Trek featured such a device, calling it a ""hypospray.""

Portal Instruments, a company that is developing jet injectors, uses technology based on work done by Ian Hunter at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

""Initially, we worked on microneedles,"" says the company's CEO Patrick Anquetil. ""And then Ian realized that why don't we just remove the needle altogether? And that's how this project came to be.""

Needle-free jet injectors were actually used in the 1960s in mass smallpox vaccination campaigns. As described by the CDC, these devices use a high-pressure, narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin. The diameter of the stream is comparable to a mosquito bite.

The devices were used to quickly vaccinate large numbers of people, including members of the armed forces.

Anquetil notes that the older devices sometimes made patients feel as if they had been punched.

""To create the jet, you have to instantaneously create 100 times more pressure than you've got in the tire of a car,"" he says. ""Patients actually hated them because they were more painful than a needle and syringe.""

Others echo that sentiment.

""My 85-year-old neighbor still remembers how painful it was,"" says Ron Lowy, CEO of PharmaJet, a company that makes an FDA-approved jet injector that administers a flu vaccine.

The older devices had another problem. They used the same nozzle for multiple injections, leading to concerns about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients.

Today's devices have made a lot of progress, Lowy says. Now, the syringe is changed for each patient and the injections are gentler.

""It feels like somebody snapped me with a rubber band,"" he says, adding that the injection happens too fast for some patients to register any sensation at all. It lasts about one-tenth of a second.

He says hundreds of thousands of people in the U.S. have already received the flu vaccine via one of PharmaJet's injectors.

""If you have your choice, you want to get poked with a needle or you want to try this? Most of the people say, 'Yeah, I'll try that,' "" he says.

Cost remains an issue for some jet injectors. Portal is aiming to get its cost down to $3 or $4 per injection.

""In vaccines, what's really hard is that there's a very, very high volume, and you're competing with a needle and syringe, which is tremendously low cost,"" Anquetil says.

PharmaJet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money. The company says its flu vaccine ""starter kit,"" which can vaccinate 500 people, costs $900.

Nasal spray hits a roadblock

FluMist, an FDA-approved flu vaccine delivered through a nasal spray, was widely used in the U.S. and, at one point, was even the preferred method of vaccination for children.

Then last year, in a sharp turnaround, the CDC recommended that it not be used during the 2016-17 flu season after a study found it had not been very effective in the previous year, particularly among kids.

The vaccine's effectiveness was just 3 percent, so low that ""no protective benefit could be measured"" for children ages 2 to 17, the CDC said in a statement.

In contrast, the effectiveness of the flu shot was about 63 percent for kids in that age group.

AstraZeneca, the parent company behind FluMist, says the CDC's data contradicts data from several other studies, which show the vaccine was about 48 percent effective during the same flu season. And the same vaccine continues to be recommended and used in European Union markets, AstraZeneca says.

In the U.S., the CDC continues to recommend against the nasal spray vaccine for the upcoming flu season. AstraZeneca hopes to reverse that decision before flu season begins.

""We continue to pursue a broad-based investigation to identify potential causes of lower effectiveness"" in recent years, the company said in a statement, adding that one of the four flu virus strains it used in the vaccine during the past two flu seasons may have been the problem.

The company has chosen a new strain of live virus that is similar to other strains that have proven effective in studies and clinical trials.",1

THURSDAY, July 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A laser treatment can reduce spots in people's vision known as ""floaters,"" a new study finds.

""Floaters often arise as the vitreous -- a gel-like substance that fills the eye -- contracts and pulls away from the back of the eye,"" explained ophthalmologist Dr. Naomi Goldberg, who reviewed the new research. She works at the Manhattan Eye, Ear and Throat Hospital in New York City.

Floaters become more common with age, and although some people simply get used to them, others are bothered by them or their vision is impaired.

The new research was led by Dr. Chirag Shah and Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Ophthalmic Consultants of Boston. They explained that, currently, there are three management options for floaters: patient education and observation; surgery; and a laser procedure known as YAG vitreolysis.

However, Shah and Heier said there are few published studies on the laser treatment's effectiveness in treating floaters.

The new study involved 52 patients with floaters who received one session of either the YAG laser treatment or a ""sham"" placebo laser treatment.

Six months after treatment, 54 percent of patients in the YAG group reported significantly greater improvement in floater-related visual disturbances, compared with only 9 percent of those in the placebo group.

Nineteen patients (53 percent) in the YAG group reported significantly or completely improved symptoms, compared with none of the patients in the placebo group, the researchers added.

The patients in the YAG group also had improvements in several other measures, including general vision and independence, compared with those in the placebo group, the findings showed.

There were no differences between the two groups in harmful side effects, according to the study, which was published July 20 in JAMA Ophthalmology.

A limitation of the study was its small size and short follow-up period, the researchers said. ""Greater confidence in these outcomes may result from larger confirmatory studies of longer duration,"" the study authors wrote.

For her part, Goldberg said that although ""there was significant improvement in patients' symptoms following treatment, and no significant complication was seen,"" these findings are early and ""it is difficult to predict the long-term safety of this laser procedure.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - British liquid biopsy company Angle said its Parsortix blood test had beaten current methods in identifying ovarian cancer, a breakthough that could help women receive the best possible outcome from surgery.

Headline results from a study of 400 patients in Europe and the United States showed the test to detect cancerous cells in the bloodstream correctly identified cancer in up to 95 percent of cases, the company said.

The test will enable women with ovarian cancer to be referred to gynaecological surgeons who specialize in the care of women with ovarian cancer, while patients with a benign tumor will not have to travel to specialist centers.

Angle founder and chief executive Andrew Newland said the study had demonstrated the ability to correctly detect cancer, and importantly correctly detect the absence of cancer.

The test was nearly twice as successful in eliminating false-positives than current tests, he said.

It also had the potential to identify targets on the tumor that could be used to inform treatment strategies, he said.

“The vision is that a woman who has been diagnosed with having an abnormal pelvic mass will have a simple blood test and from that we will deduce whether or not she has cancer and if she does which drug would be most suitable for her,” he said.

The performance of the test would now be validated in another study designed to meet European CE Mark and US FDA regulatory requirements, he said.

Shares in Angle, which has a market cap of about 50 million pounds, rose 2.2 percent to 68 pence.",1
"WASHINGTON—An experimental drug is showing promise against an untreatable eye disease that blinds older adults — and intriguingly, it seems to work in patients who carry a particular gene flaw that fuels the damage to their vision.

Age-related macular degeneration, or AMD, is the leading cause of vision loss among seniors, gradually eroding crucial central vision. There are different forms but more than 5 million people worldwide, and a million in the U.S., have an advanced type of so-called “dry” macular degeneration that has no treatment. First patients may notice blurriness when they look straight ahead. Eventually many develop blank spots, becoming legally blind.

“These are seniors who are entering their golden years and now they’ve lost the ability to read, watch television, see their loved ones,” said Dr. Rahul Khurana, a retina specialist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology.

The experimental drug, lampalizumab, aims to slow the destruction of light-sensing cells in the retina, creeping lesions that characterize the stage of dry AMD called “geographic atrophy.” When those cells die, they can’t grow back — the vision loss is irreversible.

What the research found

In an 18-month study of 129 patients, monthly eye injections of the drug modestly slowed worsening of the disease when compared with patients given dummy shots. What’s exciting for scientists came next, when researchers from drugmaker Genentech Inc. took a closer look at exactly who was being helped.

It turns out that nearly 6 in 10 of the study’s participants carry a gene variation that makes part of the immune system go awry — a genetic flaw already known to increase the risk of getting macular degeneration in the first place.

Those are the only patients who appeared to benefit from the drug; they had 44 per cent less eye damage than the untreated patients, the Genentech team reported Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine. While the study is too small to prove if lampalizumab really helps maintain vision, that’s a bigger difference than the overall results suggested.

Why would an immune-related gene affect aging eyes?

One arm of the immune system, the complement pathway, helps fight infections by attracting immune cells to attack bacteria.

Normally, there’s a barrier that keeps such cells away from the retina. But that barrier can break down with age, opening sensitive eye cells to harm from the spillover, explained Genentech immunologist Menno van Lookeren Campagne.

Now for the gene connection: Previous studies have linked macular degeneration to gene variations that remove some of that pathway’s natural brakes, so it can become too active.

The hypothesis: Genentech’s drug, lampalizumab, essentially offers a backup method for tamping down the immune reaction. An antibody, it works by inhibiting a particular enzyme named factor D that helps power the immune pathway.

YOU MIGHT BE INTERESTED IN...

“We try to reinsert the braking ability,” said study lead author Brian Yaspan, a Genentech senior scientist.

What’s next?

Wednesday’s study detected no safety concerns, clearing the way for Genentech and its parent company Roche to open two large-scale studies that aim to prove if the drug works. Results are expected later this year.

The current research sheds light on how that long-suspected immune culprit might be working, and is “the first suggestion that there may be a treatment for geographic atrophy coming up in the future,” said National Eye Institute retina specialist Dr. Wai Wong, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“It’s a very, very exciting study,” said Khurana, the ophthalmologist association’s spokesman, who also wasn’t part of the research. “From the basic science perspective, it makes a lot of sense.”

Macular degeneration tends to occur after age 60, but it sometimes strikes earlier. According to the National Eye Institute, it’s less common in people who exercise regularly, avoid smoking, and eat a diet high in green leafy vegetables and fish.

Symptoms often aren’t noticeable early on. But several eye tests can detect signs of macular degeneration, including a dilated eye exam and a tool called an Amsler grid with straight lines that may look wavy if the macula, the centre of the retina, is harmed.

Macular degeneration patients often are advised to take certain vitamin combinations that may help stave off advanced disease. And it’s important for patients to know what type they have. While there’s no treatment for the advanced dry form, the “wet” form occurs when leaky blood vessels grow under the retina — and there are several therapies that can help those patients preserve vision.",1
"NEW YORK -- A new study says yoga may be as good a treatment for back pain as physical therapy.

One person who might agree is 74-year-old Judith Zaborowski, who took up yoga more than 10 years ago to help with her aching back.

""I'm much more comfortable with movement,"" she told CBS News. ""Yoga makes me think about my back and how I'm standing and if I'm standing properly, then I can function better.""

In the study, 320 adults with moderate to severe back pain received one of three approaches over 12 weeks:

Weekly yoga classes



15 physical therapy visits



Education about how to cope with back pain



CBS News

Yoga was just as effective as physical therapy -- and both groups were about 20 percent less likely to use pain medication than patients receiving education alone.

Yoga classes started with relaxation exercises, warm up, then gentle yoga poses like wall dog and chair twist.

Dr. Robert Saper CBS News

Dr. Robert Saper at Boston Medical Center is one of the authors. He explained the results.

""Yoga was as effective as physical therapy for reducing pain intensity,"" Saper said. ""Perhaps most importantly reducing pain medication use.""

Saper says yoga likely works by strengthening core and lower back muscles and helping with mind-body relaxation.

""I feel, the more that one can do for one's self and not depend on medication, the healthier it is for your body,"" Zaborowski said.

MONDAY, June 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative to pain medications for some emergency room patients, a new study reports.

""While acupuncture is widely used by practitioners in community settings for treating pain, it is rarely used in hospital emergency departments,"" said study lead investigator Marc Cohen. He is a professor in the School of Health and Biomedical Sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia.

The study -- billed as the world's largest randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture in the emergency department -- included 528 patients.

The study participants were seen at four Australian emergency departments for acute low back pain, migraines or ankle sprains. Patients who said their level of pain was at least 4 on a 10-point scale received one of three treatments: acupuncture alone; acupuncture with painkillers; or painkillers alone.

One hour after treatment, less than 40 percent of all patients had significant pain reduction, meaning at least a 2-point decline on the 10-point scale. More than 80 percent still had a pain rating of at least 4, the findings showed.

But two days later, most patients were satisfied. Overall, nearly 83 percent of acupuncture-only patients said they would probably or definitely repeat their treatment, compared with about 81 percent in the combined group, and 78 percent who took painkillers alone.

""Emergency nurses and doctors need a variety of pain-relieving options when treating patients, given the concerns around opioids such as morphine, which carry the risk of addiction when used long-term,"" Cohen said in a university news release.

The study results suggest acupuncture would be especially beneficial for patients who can't use standard pain-relieving drugs because of other medical conditions, Cohen added.

But he noted that more research is needed because some patients remained in pain no matter what treatment they received.

The study was published June 18 in the Medical Journal of Australia.

"Scientists have developed a simple three-in-one blood test they believe could transform treatment of advanced prostate cancer, helping to extend or save lives.

The test, developed by researchers at the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) in London and the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, picks out men suitable for treatment with olaparib, part of a revolutionary class of drugs called “PARP-inhibitors”, which stops damaged cells from repairing themselves.

The liquid biopsy, less invasive than a tissue biopsy, also detects early signs of resistance to olaparib and monitors the cancer’s evolution over time, according to the paper, published in Cancer Discovery on Monday.

Prof Johann de Bono, Regius professor of cancer research at the ICR, and consultant medical oncologist at the Royal Marsden NHS foundation trust, said: “Our study identifies, for the first time, genetic changes that allow prostate cancer cells to become resistant to the precision medicine olaparib.

“From these findings, we were able to develop a powerful, three-in-one test that could in future be used to help doctors select treatment, check whether it is working and monitor the cancer in the longer term. We think it could be used to make clinical decisions about whether a PARP-inhibitor is working within as little as four to eight weeks of starting therapy.

“Not only could the test have a major impact on treatment of prostate cancer, but it could also be adapted to open up the possibility of precision medicine to patients with other types of cancer as well.”

By testing cancer DNA in the bloodstream, the researchers found they could pick out which men with advanced prostate cancer were likely to benefit from treatment with the drug.



They also used the test to analyse DNA in the blood after treatment had started, so people who were not responding could be identified and switched to alternative therapy in as little as four to eight weeks.

Thirdly, they used the test to monitor a patient’s blood throughout treatment to quickly pick up signs that the cancer was evolving genetically and might be becoming resistant to the drugs.

The researchers collected blood samples from 49 men at the Royal Marsden with advanced prostate cancer enrolled in the phase II clinical trial of olaparib.



The drug is effective at killing cancer cells that have errors in genes which would otherwise keep them healthy. Some patients respond to olaparib for years but in others the treatment can fail early or the cancer can evolve resistance.

The ICR chief executive, Prof Paul Workman, said the test could “usher in a new era of precision medicine for prostate cancer”.

He said: “Blood tests for cancer promise to be truly revolutionary. They are cheap and simple to use, but most importantly, because they aren’t invasive, they can be employed or applied to routinely monitor patients to spot early if treatment is failing – offering patients the best chance of surviving their disease.”

"George Burke has a talent for tossing back his daily cocktail — which contains vitamins, minerals, muscle-building compounds, some little-known research drugs and a microdose of LSD — in almost a single gulp. It’s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet.

Burke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California’s Silicon Valley, where he’s the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees.

He used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn’t find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics — some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers — said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation.

“It’s not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,” Burke acknowledges. “It’s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that.”

The word “nootropic” was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for “mind” and “bending.” Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity.

But when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes.

Piracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it’s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts.

Using ‘stacks’

A number of companies now market nootropic “stacks,” or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot.

Because they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny.

When Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. “It was as if I was buying coke off the street,” he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company.

But self-experimenters such as Burke often don’t restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets.

“Who doesn’t want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn’t want to maximize their muscle mass?” asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else.

But while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs — of any type — improve thinking or productivity over the long run. “There’s a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,” notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, “it’s a zero-sum game. That’s because when you up one circuit in the brain, you’re probably impairing another system.”

Short-term benefits?

Early studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics — so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight.

A 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer’s disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer’s. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting.

Although piracetam has a history of “relatively few side effects,” it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. “We don’t use it at all and never have.”

As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. “Piracetam has been studied for decades,” says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But “some of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they’re selling. Please don’t take it, people!”

For Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough.

Burke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee — a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil — has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance “to teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day.”

Last spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD — which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity — was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a “party dose” — enough to give you “the glow” and enhance your cognitive powers without “the trip.”

Burke says he definitely got the glow. “The first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information.”

The effects of fasting

Not all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though.

Nootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body.

“We stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,” says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company’s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms — not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat.

“Fasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,” Lam enthuses. “It’s like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you.”

Nootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members.

Research on animals has shown that intermittent fasting — limiting caloric intake at least two days a week — can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice.

Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence — so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting.

“There’s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,” he says.

Fasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, “I fast for greater physical and mental efficiency.” The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures.

Far easier to take a pill.

Looking for an edge

Vinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city’s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement.

Ngo has experimented with piracetam himself (“The first time I tried it, I thought, ‘Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.’ I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful”) and the neurotransmitter DMEA (“You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It’s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain”).

But he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures.

“There is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,” Ngo says. “People want to find an edge over their competitor — that’s how they got their position in the first place. I’m trying to give them a little more wiggle room — but in a safe way.”

He says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests.

There’s no one-size-fits-all approach. “I don’t have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate” for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics.

If, for example, someone decides to go on medication — be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam — the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems.

“I want to empower them,” Ngo says, but “there’s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.”

"Wagler's pit viper

THURSDAY, June 8, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scary pit vipers may need an image upgrade: Their venom might end up helping human heart patients, research suggests.

Taiwanese scientists say a blood thinner drug based on venom from the Wagler's pit viper was effective in mice, and might prove safer than current anti-clotting meds for humans one day.

The serpent-medicine connection isn't new, one cardiologist noted, since venom typically kills by disrupting the blood's clotting mechanisms.

""Blood thinner medications have a long and storied history with snake venom,"" said Dr Satjit Bhysri, a heart specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. In fact, ""many current blood thinners are based on initial experiments from proteins found in snake venom,"" he added.

In the new study, a team led by Tur-Fu Huang, a pharmacology researcher at National Taiwan University, focused on the venom of the Tropidolaemuswaglerix snake -- a Southeast Asian species known as Wagler's pit viper or the Temple viper.

The snake's venom contains a protein called trowaglerix, the researchers explained. Designing a molecule based on trowaglerix, Huang's group was able to block GPVI -- a protein that sits on the surface of blood platelet cells and is crucial to allowing these cells to clump together and form clots.

When mixed with blood, the new compound prevented blood cells called platelets from clotting. Also, mice that received the drug had slower blood clot formation than untreated mice, but the treated mice did not bleed longer than untreated mice. Still, experiments in animals often don't translate to success in humans, so further research is needed.

Dr. Kevin Marzo is head of cardiology at NYU Winthrop Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. Reviewing the findings, he agreed that the drug under development may have merit.

""Many of the lifesaving drugs used in the treatment of heart attack patients work by inhibiting platelets and preventing blood clotting. However, it is often at the cost of serious bleeding complications,"" he said.

""The potential development of a new agent based on snake venom that could have similar beneficial effects on preventing blood clotting, and potentially cause less bleeding side effects, is an exciting discovery that warrants future investigation,"" Marzo added.

The study was published June 8 in the journal Arteriosclerosis, Thrombosis and Vascular Biology.

"A daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib (Celebrex) at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn’t have dangerous side effects, researchers say.

Dr. Jean-Yves Reginster of Liege State University in Belgium and colleagues recruited 604 people over age 50 with knee osteoarthritis from five European countries and randomly assigned them to take 800 mg of the extra-pure chondroitin sulfate (Chondrosulf), 200 mg of celecoxib (Celebrex) or a placebo every day for six months.

Those who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study, and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo, according to the report in Annals of the Rheumatic Diseases.

Reginster told Reuters Health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years.

He stressed that pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin is not the same as over-the-counter supplements, which are made differently and can’t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain.

European regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical-grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical-grade glucosamine sulfate as first-line treatments for osteoarthritis, Reginster said by email, because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non-steroidal inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) including stomach ulcers, bleeding, liver and kidney problems.

Dr. Michael Shepard of Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Orange, California, noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most U.S. studies of this type would run two years rather than six months.

In addition, U.S.-based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results, said Shepard, who wasn’t involved in the study. Some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen (also an NSAID), and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo, he told Reuters Health.

“I tell my patients, ‘buyer beware,’” Shepard said in an email. “I tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature. I tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it, then keep taking it.”

If chondroitin doesn’t work for them, he suggests taking an NSAID “periodically,” and to be aware of the side effects.

“If you are going to stay on an NSAID for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor,” Shepard cautioned.

Dr. Rachel Wolfe of Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, agreed that chondroitin is “reasonable to try” for some people, especially those with contraindications to NSAIDs.

“However, it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises, and weight loss, which we know will provide benefit. It should be used in conjunction with these measures,” said Wolfe, who wasn’t involved in the study.

“Chondroitin is not a miracle pill, but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active, thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles, then I think there may benefit,” Wolfe told Reuters Health by email. “Studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art - we do not have perfect answers, and we have to individualize for each patient.”

The study was sponsored by IBSA Institut Biochimique SA, a pharmaceutical company based in Lugano, Switzerland, that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test.

"With little fanfare, the Food and Drug Administration did something this week that it’s never done before: The agency approved a single prescription drug, pembrolizumab (marketed by Merck as Keytruda) for treatment of solid tumors in any organ so long as the malignancy bears a specific genetic signature.

In the fast-moving field of cancer treatment, the FDA’s announcement marks an important milestone, close to two decades in the making. Increasingly, cancer will no longer be identified, categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits, or in which it first gained its foothold. In a shift that is already underway, cancers will be known by — and treated for — the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them.

In clinical trial evidence cited by the FDA this week, pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about 40% of patients with one of 15 end-stage malignancies. And for 78% of those patients, that response lasted six months or more. A trial reported earlier this year found that in 17 of 30 advanced cancer patients, pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer, and 24 patients were still alive a year after starting the drug.

All of those subjects, of course, had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target.

Advertisement

In the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments, that record of success constitutes a “home run,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein of Johns Hopkins University’s Kimmel Cancer Center. Vogelstein’s 1993 research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumab’s broad cancer-fighting powers.

With the FDA’s announcement, drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians, patients and government regulators think of cancer. No longer will they see all cancers of the lung, breast, colon, brain, liver, pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another. Instead, they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where they’re found. And they’ll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon, either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack.

It’s a key principle of what’s called “precision medicine” — the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumor’s specific molecular fingerprint, and not, as most chemotherapies do, harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones.

In the cancers pembrolizumab treats, the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern DNA repair. Deficiencies in the DNA’s “mismatch repair system” generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells, and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets. The mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma, non-small-cell lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin’s lymphoma, and the FDA had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week.

But this week’s FDA approval goes further: It makes clear that the drug’s molecular targets are also common in colorectal, endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers, and less frequently present in cancers of the breast, prostate, bladder, and thyroid gland.

All told, scientists believe about 4% of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by Keytruda.

The appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape — not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well.

Organizations representing, say, people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients. In cancer centers, specialists in, say, melanoma will start (in fact, have already started) treating patients with a range of other cancers. When drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug, they’ll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than they’ve used in the past: the genetic signatures their tumors bear.

Even before the FDA’s announcement this week, all these processes were underway. The FDA’s decision recognizes that fact, said Dr. Svetomir Markovic, an immunologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who specializes in treating melanoma.

But the decision also puts cancer physicians — as well as insurers, who will be called on to pay Keytruda’s $100,000-per-year price tag — on notice that a new era is at hand, said Markovic.

“The field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed,” he said. Physicians “are having a hard time keeping up, and I can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same,” he added. “But this decision by the FDA is really wonderful: It has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help.”

Two other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment — nivolumab (marketed as Opdivo) and ipilimumab (Yervoy) — but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum. Several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials, and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be.

“In many ways we’re at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy: There’s clear benefit but it’s still a minority of patients that get long-term benefit,” said Markovic of the Mayo Institute. “We will get better at this.”

Markovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab, as well as the FDA’s new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions, could prompt drug companies, physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs. With a clearer idea of which patients they might help, and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials, some failures may look more promising, he said.

“We just needed to take the first step in showing that this long-believed theory — that the immune system can kill cancer — is true,” Markovic added. “It indeed can.”

"(Reuters) - Pivotal trial results for Merck & Co Inc’s immunotherapy drug Keytruda show that it lengthened survival by three months, or nearly 40 percent, for patients with advanced bladder cancer who had stopped responding to chemotherapy.

The data, to be presented next month at a meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, follow last week’s announcement that rival drug Tecentriq, from Roche Holding AG, did not improve survival when used as a second-line treatment for bladder cancer in a trial.

The Merck drug is awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, but Tecentriq was approved by the agency last year, contingent on verification of its clinical benefit. Roche, in an emailed statement, said it plans to discuss the data with health authorities but did not disclose the timing for the discussions. According to the FDA approval letter, the company has until December to submit the full trial data to the agency.

Merck filed in February for FDA approval of Keytruda for both initial and secondary treatment of advanced urothelial cancer, the most common type of bladder cancer. Keytruda is already approved for treating melanoma, lung cancer, head and neck cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma.

Merck announced in October that the second-line bladder cancer study met its main goal and was stopped early. The company is currently enrolling patients in a phase three trial of Keytruda, combined with chemotherapy, as an initial treatment for bladder cancer.

In addition to Tecentriq’s approval for bladder cancer patients whose disease has stopped responding to chemotherapy, the FDA last month approved the Roche drug as an initial treatment for people with a specific type of advanced bladder cancer and in people whose cancer progressed despite at least one prior platinum-containing chemotherapy.

The agency has also granted contingent approval to AstraZeneca Plc’s Imfinzi, Bristol-Myers Squibb’s Opdivo and Bavencio, developed by Pfizer Inc and Merck KGaA, as second-line bladder cancer treatments.

All five drugs are part of a new class of treatments designed to unleash the body’s immune system to fight cancer by interfering with proteins known as PD-1 or PD-L1 that help malignant cells evade immune attack.

Merck said data from an open-label Phase 3 trial of 542 advanced bladder cancer patients showed median survival of 10.3 months for Keytruda patients and 7.4 months for patients given second-line chemotherapy. The study’s median follow-up was 18.5 months.

After 18 months, 36 percent of Keytruda patients were alive, compared with 20.5 percent of chemotherapy patients, according to research published by ASCO.

The study did not detect a difference in the length of time patients lived without their disease getting worse.

Severe side effects were reported in 16.5 percent of the Keytruda patients, compared with nearly half of the chemotherapy group.",1

"The question

Millions of people take a low-dose aspirin daily in hopes of reducing their chances of having a heart attack. For women, might aspirin also help prevent breast cancer?

This study

The researchers analyzed data on 57,164 women, most in their early 60s, who had no history of breast cancer. About 23 percent of the women reported taking a low-dose aspirin (81 milligrams), 18 percent took ibuprofen, 11 percent took full-strength aspirin (325 mg) and about 10 percent took a COX-2 inhibitor or another nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID). All were taking the medication at least three times a week.

Over seven years, 1,457 women got a breast-cancer diagnosis. Those taking low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely to have developed any type of breast cancer, compared with women who took no NSAID. They were 20 percent less likely to have developed the most common type: breast cancer that is hormone-receptor-positive and HER2-negative. The study did not find similar links between regular-dose aspirin or other NSAIDs and the risk for breast cancer.

[Certain adults should take a daily baby aspirin, expert panel says]

Who may be affected?

Women. About 1 of every 8 women in the United States will develop breast cancer at some point. Those who take a daily low-dose aspirin, also called a baby aspirin, usually do so to prevent cardiovascular disease, the leading cause of death for women older than 25. Aspirin has been shown to help keep blood from clotting, which can help prevent heart attacks and ischemic stroke (the type caused by a blocked blood vessel in the brain). However, aspirin can increase the risk for internal bleeding, so women should talk with their doctors before starting a low-dose aspirin regimen, for any reason.

Caveats

The researchers suggested that the difference in results between low- and regular-dose aspirin may have been attributable to most women taking low-dose aspirin more often than three times a week, even daily, for cardiovascular protection as opposed to more-sporadic use of regular-dose aspirin for pain relief. Hormone therapy and alcohol use were more prevalent among the participants than normal; both are considered risk factors for breast cancer and may have affected the results. Data on aspirin and other NSAID usage came from the women’s responses on questionnaires. Most of the participants were white.

HealthDay Reporter

FRIDAY, May 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Blood thinners are often prescribed to prevent strokes in people with the abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation. But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay.

The researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners.

""We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He's director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah.

Atrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot.

Atrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren't even aware of, Bunch explained.

While many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin's benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner.

Although the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said.

In patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke.

A score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers.

In this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia.

In patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported.

The longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said.

For the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed.

""Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn't wait longer than a month to begin treatment,"" Bunch said. ""The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,"" he added.

The results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

According to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), ""There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia."" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF.

""Therefore,"" he said, ""we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline,"" Lee said.

SAN FRANCISCO — Tech company developer conferences always feature a wacky demo or three.

But at Build 2017 in Seattle Wednesday, Microsoft went for the waterworks at the conclusion of CEO Satya Nadella's keynote address: it showcased a prototype watch that temporarily eliminated the arm shaking that often plagues those suffering from the neurological disease Parkinson's.

After a speech that both heralded and warned about coming leaps in technological power, Nadella screened a video that told the story of two British Microsoft Research employees, Haiyan Zhang and Nicolas Villa, who developed the tremor-interrupting device for a BBC documentary, The Big Life Fix.

Working with graphic designer and Parkinson's sufferer Emma Lawton, 32, the researchers developed a watch — which they named Emma — that, according to Microsoft, ""vibrates in a distinctive pattern to disrupt the feedback loop between brain and hand.""

The video showed Lawton trying to draw a square with her shaky right hand, and then again, wearing Emma. Watson erupts in tears as she calls her mother to say this is the first time she's been able to write her name in ages.

When the lights went up, Nadella welcomed both Lawton and engineer Zhang on stage, thanking them for showing that thanks ""developers can have impact.""

Emma Watch remains a prototype, Microsoft says, but the developers are working with a neuroscience research team to undertake trials with a small group of Parkinson's sufferers.

The watch works through a combination of sensors and AI (artificial intelligence) techniques to potentially detect and monitor symptoms like tremors, stiffness and instability, among others, according to Microsoft. ""Once these symptoms can be identified and measured, it’s possible to develop technology and devices that help humans manage their symptoms. AI is used to classify the sensor information and elicit real-time responses on small devices like wearables.""

Microsoft stresses that Emma Watch is not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 10 million people. ""Rather, its technology has the potential to help Parkinson’s patients manage symptoms that impede regular functions. The goal of further research is to determine whether Emma Watch could help other people with similar Parkinson’s symptoms.""

"Spit Test May Reveal The Severity Of A Child's Concussion

Enlarge this image toggle caption technotr/Getty Images technotr/Getty Images

A little spit may help predict whether a child's concussion symptoms will subside in days or persist for weeks.

A test that measures fragments of genetic material in saliva was nearly 90 percent accurate in identifying children and adolescents whose symptoms persisted for at least a month, a Penn State team told the Pediatric Academic Societies Meeting in San Francisco, Calif. In contrast, a concussion survey commonly used by doctors was right less than 70 percent of the time.

If the experimental test pans out, ""a pediatrician could collect saliva with a swab, send it off to the lab and then be able to call the family the next day,"" says Steven Hicks, an assistant professor of pediatrics at Penn State Hershey. Hicks helped develop the test and consults for a company that hopes to market concussion tests.

A reliable test would help overcome a major obstacle in assessing and treating concussions, which affect more than one million children and adolescents in the U.S. each year. Many of the injuries are related to sports.

In most cases, concussion symptoms last only a few days. But up to 25 percent of young patients ""go on to have these prolonged headaches, fatigue, nausea, and those symptoms can last sometimes one to four months,"" Hicks says.

And, right now, there's no way to know which kids are going to have long-term problems, he says.

""Parents often say that their biggest concern is, 'When is my child going to be back to normal again?' "" Hicks says. ""And that's something we have a very difficult time predicting.""

Hicks and a team of researchers have been looking for an objective test that might help.

They knew that, after a concussion, injured brain cells try to heal themselves. As a part of this process, brain cells release tiny fragments of genetic material called microRNAs. Some of these fragments eventually turn up in blood and even in saliva.

The team did an experiment that involved 50 concussion patients between the ages of 7 and 18.

""When they came to our medical center and received the diagnosis of concussion, we evaluated them with some standard survey-based tools and then we also got a sample of their saliva,"" Hicks says. Most samples were collected about a week after the injury.

The team measured levels of many different microRNAs in the samples, and eventually they identified a handful that let them predict how long symptoms would last. They also identified one microRNA that predicted which children would have a specific concussion symptom: difficulties with memory and problem solving, Hicks says.

A saliva test could greatly improve care for young people who don't have obvious symptoms of a concussion, says Manish Bhomia, an adjunct assistant professor at the Uniformed Services University of the Health Sciences in Bethesda, Md.

""A lot of children get mild concussion and oftentimes it goes ignored,"" he says.

A reliable lab test would help ensure that children who have a head injury don't go back to school, or to the soccer field, before their brain has healed, Bhomia says.

And microRNAs offer a promising way to assess concussions in adults as well as children, says Bhomia, whose research involves a range of ""biomarkers"" for traumatic brain injury.

But saliva may not be the best place to measure microRNAs, Bhomia says. A better option, he says, might be blood samples, which tend to contain greater numbers of the genetic fragments.",1
"Blindfolded, would you know the smell of your mom, a lover or a co-worker? Not the smells of their colognes or perfumes, not of the laundry detergents they use — the smells of them?

Modern medical research, too, confirms that the smell of someone’s skin, breath and bodily fluids can be suggestive of illness.

"Cognitive behavioural therapy has significant positive effects on a mother’s mental health, income, employment and parenting skills even seven years after the birth of the child, according to the first study of its kind.

The international research project into the impact of depression on pregnant mothers and their babies, led by Professor Sonia Bhalotra from the Institute for Social and Economic Research at the University of Essex, could have major implications for public policy.

More than 400 million people worldwide report episodes of depression, at a global cost of around £600bn in 2010. Between 12% and 20% of women in the 35 countries in the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development suffer from perinatal depression, and 20-35% in poorer countries.

Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a talking therapy that can help a person manage problems by changing how they think and behave. The NHS website explains that it is “based on the concept that your thoughts, feelings, physical sensations and actions are interconnected, and that negative thoughts and feelings can trap you in a vicious cycle”.

CBT encourages people to see their problems in a more positive way by breaking them down into smaller parts.

While studies have highlighted the short-term benefits of CBT, until now question marks have been raised about whether it can have long-term effects.

The study, one of the largest randomised control trials to be held in the developing world, followed women diagnosed with depression mid-pregnancy in 40 communities in rural Pakistan. Within a year, more than half of the women in a control group (58%) were still depressed, whereas only a quarter of the mothers who had been treated with CBT reported depression.

Returning to the women and their children seven years later, researchers found that the treated mothers were still significantly less likely to be depressed than the control group. The first group were also more likely to be employed and have control over household spending. There were also big improvements in their parenting style.

The study found that women who had least social support such as those who were not living with or near their mother or mother-in-law, benefited most from the therapy intervention, both in the short and long term.

“These findings on the longer-term benefits at seven years post-treatment are really exciting,” Bhalotra said. “This is an important study for the impact on mothers with depression but there are global implications for the treatment of all human beings suffering from depression. We have seen that CBT has changed how many of the treated women live their lives now – their mental health has improved, their financial situation and their empowerment over their lives, and undoubtedly the way they interact with their children.”",1

"Up until the Mona Lisa Touch Laser, there has not been a successful non-medication alternative treatment option for vaginal dryness, also known at vulvo-vaginal atrophy, or VVA. Women in menopause or those who cannot take estrogen, including our breast cancer survivors, often suffer in silence when their vagina decides to completely dry up and lose its moist and supple lining, causing disruptive symptoms. It can affect your ability to do everyday activities such as exercise and engage in sexual contact and intercourse due to pain and discomfort.

Symptoms of VVA include dryness, burning, irritation, itching, urinary incontinence and urinary frequency. These symptoms are mainly caused by a condition called vaginal atrophy, which is due to menopause or peri-menopause or occurs after child birth.

Women with VVA report the following:

75 percent of women report vaginal atrophy negatively impacts their lives.

63 percent failed to recognize vaginal atrophy as a chronic condition.

44 percent report they did not consult a gynecologist for finding a solution.

4 percent only recognized the common symptoms of vaginal atrophy.

Estrogen is the best treatment option for VVA since it rehydrates the vagina and restores lubrication and pH balance in the vagina. Unfortunately, this is not always an appropriate option, especially if you have breast cancer or are unable or unwilling to be on estrogen. Other medication options include Osphena, vaginal estrogen, steroid and testosterone creams, and lubrications or moisturizers.

The Mona Lisa Touch Laser Treatment, or MLLT, is one of the newest kids on the block to combat vaginal atrophy. There are other types of vaginal lasers, but they don't have the same track record, Food and Drug Administration support and long-term studies as the MLLT. An Italian-built laser device, the Mona Lisa Touch Laser holds tremendous promise in treating a vagina that has been transformed in menopause or via cancer treatment side effects.

Once you've had a pelvic exam to assure you're an appropriate candidate, a physician trained in the use of the Mona Lisa – which is actually a small vaginal laser – inserts the device into the vagina during three 4-minute sessions, six weeks apart. Many women report positive changes after just the first 4-minute treatment, which involves removing the dried skin inside that vagina, stimulating collagen and blood flow production, and allowing vaginal revival. The end result is a vagina makeover – a new lease on a vagina, if you will – with more elasticity and natural lubrication of the tissue inside the vagina. Although it may sound too good to be true, the results are proving to be a game changer in the way vagina atrophy is being treated – without hormones – which is a relief to many women and their partners.

Mona Lisa is ideal for women who can't take estrogen due to a personal or family history of breast cancer or for those who are unhappy with the side effects associated with hormone replacement therapy. Still, there is a painful part of the procedure: the cost. It runs about $1,000 a session and is most likely not covered by insurance.",1
"A minimally invasive procedure designed to shrink prostate tissue with a series of nine-second blasts of steam offers men a new treatment for urinary symptoms commonly associated with enlarged prostates.

The procedure, called Rezūm (pronounced “resume”) and developed by NxThera Inc. of Maple Grove, Minn., became widely available in the U.S. in the second half of 2016. Thermal energy in the form of steam is applied to the prostate with a needle. As it cools it releases heat energy into the tissue, killing cells and shrinking the prostate overall by about a third, says Bob Paulson, NxThera’s chief executive.

Some 50% of men over the age of 50 have enlarged prostates, which can produce symptoms such as increased urgency to urinate during the day and frequent urination, which disrupts sleep at night. Sufferers often must choose between surgery or medication, both of which have side effects, including sexual dysfunction.

The NxThera therapy is the second major innovation in recent years for men with enlarged prostates. The other, an implanted device called UroLift, was introduced in the U.S. in 2013 by NeoTract Inc. of Pleasanton, Calif.

After years of little improvement in the minimally invasive treatment of enlarged prostates, men now have two new options “that leave your sexual function intact,” says Claus G. Roehrborn, a professor and chairman of the department of urology at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center in Dallas and a co-author of published studies on both treatments.

Middle ground

Physicians say Rezūm can be used on a wider range of prostate anatomies than the UroLift implant. The procedure, which costs about $2,000 and generally is covered by insurance, can be done in a doctor’s office in just a few minutes. To dull pain, lidocaine may be injected into the prostate, and most doctors will offer a sedative for patients who want one. After the procedure, most patients need to wear a catheter for two or three days but can return to daily activities immediately.

While the results of a two-year clinical trial published by Dr. Roehrborn and colleagues show that Rezūm provides significant relief from symptoms, it isn’t clear how long the improvement will last.

“The durability issue is what’s going to sink or swim this procedure,” says study co-author Kevin T. McVary, chairman and professor of urology at Southern Illinois University School of Medicine, in Springfield, Ill. Both minimally invasive options are likely less effective than surgery, Dr. Roehrborn says, because surgery removes the most tissue.

Still, for many men, the steam treatment offers an appealing middle ground between the risk of surgery and the hassle and side effects of taking daily medication, which can cause dizziness and fatigue.

“I tried Flomax for about two years but the side effects were too annoying,” says Stephen Gooding, a 60-year-old utility supervisor from Grayson, Ga., who says the drug made him dizzy and constipated. He had the Rezūm procedure in October, and now “I feel like I did 30 years ago.”

In the two-year study of 197 men, funded by NxThera and published online in the Journal of Urology in December, patients who had the Rezūm procedure showed a significantly greater improvement in symptoms at three months compared with patients who had a sham procedure. At the end of two years, patients treated with Rezūm showed a 51% reduction in urinary symptoms (as measured by a seven-question survey), compared with the beginning of the study.

Over the two years, about 4% of the patients who underwent Rezūm had to have a repeat procedure or surgery to treat their condition. Early in the trial, physicians were new at performing the procedure and didn’t always remove enough tissue, says Cindy Ogden, vice president, clinical affairs at NxThera.

So far, Rezūm appears to spare men sexual side effects. In the surgical procedure known as transurethral resection, 70% to 80% of men generally get a condition called retrograde ejaculation, also called dry orgasm, says Dr. McVary.

In the Rezūm study, about 3% of the patients who underwent the procedure experienced no ejaculatory volume afterward, and 5.3% experienced a decrease in ejaculatory volume, according to data provided by NxThera. Ejaculatory volume can fluctuate over time in men with enlarged prostates, so it isn’t clear the reductions were caused by the procedure, Dr. McVary says. Overall in the study, there was no average change in ejaculatory volume, he adds.

Larger prostates

A major advantage of Rezūm is that it can be done on most types of anatomies. UroLift isn’t approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat the median, or middle lobe of the prostate, which contributes to symptoms in about 10% to 30% of patients, Dr. Roehrborn says.

The FDA hasn’t cleared Rezūm or UroLift for prostates weighing more than 80 grams. So NxThera can’t market its procedure for larger prostates, though doctors can legally use it on such patients if they choose.

Early results in clinical practice on large prostates appear “promising” and a study on prostates up to 150 grams is expected to begin later this year, says Ricardo Gonzalez, a urologist at Texas Medical Center in Houston, who will be a principal investigator on the research. About a quarter of men seeking treatment for prostate-related urinary symptoms have prostates greater than 80 grams, he says.

Business executive Jim Bracke, 69, says that, with just a Tylenol and the lidocaine shot, discomfort from Rezūm’s steam blasts felt no more intense than “warm water spilled on the groin.” He drove himself home after the procedure, and says he’s thrilled that he no longer needs to check out a bathroom the moment he arrives at a restaurant. And as long as he doesn’t overdo it, he adds, “I can have beer, and coffee and chocolate and still sleep through the night.”

"The new study is the latest chapter in an extraordinary, decades-long collaboration among cognitive scientists, brain surgeons and people with severe epilepsy being evaluated for an operation. The preoperative “evaluation” is a fishing expedition of sorts, in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur, to see whether it’s operable. Many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas, and the wait can take weeks in the hospital. Cognitive scientists use this opportunity, with patients’ consent, to present memory tests and take recordings.

This approach — called direct neural recording, and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes — has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory. This study used data from 150 patients, and had 20 collaborators from institutions around the country, including Emory University, the University of Washington, the Mayo Clinic and the University of California, San Francisco.

In a series of experiments, the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later, after a distraction, asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could. All the while, the scientists monitored a handful of “hot spots” in the brain which, previous work had shown, were strongly related to memory encoding. Before the stimulation tests, the team determined the precise settings for each patient’s high- and low-functioning states.

Each participant carried out the word-memorization tests repeatedly, with different words every time; some lists were memorized with brain stimulation, and other lists with no stimulation, which served as a control. The authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low- compared with high-functioning brain states.

The team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state — and worse, when the pulse arrived in a high state. “The average enhancement effect was about 12 to 13 percent,” Dr. Kahana said. “And when stimulation arrived in a good state, the average was about 15 to 20 percent worse than usual.”

Dr. Doris Greenblatt, a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at Emory, said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems. “Each seizure I had tore at the fabric of memory, and it was as if my memories weren’t attached to anything,” Dr. Greenblatt said.",1

"Army veteran Vivian Cooke has long struggled with debilitating depression. She has tried alternative therapies and medication to cope with her symptoms.

“It wasn’t effective. Some side effects would be headaches or stomachache,” she told CBS News.

Then three years ago, she decided to try something different after hearing about a study testing Botox to treat depression.

While Botox is commonly used for cosmetic purposes, doctors say the reasoning behind the treatment for depression may not be what you expect.

“We don’t believe it has anything to do with looks,” says researcher Dr. Eric Finzi of Chevy Chase Cosmetic Center.

Rather, he says it’s because facial expressions are part of the circuit of the brain related to mood.

“Fear, anger and sadness — all go through this muscle,” Finzi told CBS News, pointing out the area between the eyebrows where frown lines appear. “So Botox basically inhibits the muscle and calms it down, so it becomes more difficult to feel those negative emotions.”

The makers of Botox recently announced plans for the final phase of testing it as a treatment for depression. Finzi notes previous studies show between 50 to 60 percent of patients may benefit from the treatment.

“Our hope is eventually it will form a place as one of the tools to treat depression,” he said.

Botox is a prescription drug that blocks nerve signals to muscles in the injection area. Its effects are temporary and typically wear off after three months. Botox is currently FDA approved for cosmetic use to lessen frown lines, and for medical use to treat a number of conditions including chronic migraines, bladder incontinence, excessive underarm perspiration, and certain types of neck pain and eye issues. Costs vary widely, but the American Society for Aesthetic Plastic Surgery said the average price for a Botox treatment in 2016 was $376.

Researchers are also studying whether Botox can treat social anxiety and bipolar disorder.

As for Cooke, she said she noticed a change in her depression almost immediately.

“I found overall my mood was better on a day-to-day basis,” she said. “I had less problems with depression.”

Even though the study she took part in is now over, she said she will continue to get Botox injections.",1
"Dr. Maximilian Muenke has a superpower: He can diagnose disease just by looking at a person’s face.

Specifically, he can spot certain genetic disorders that make telltale impressions on facial features.

“Once you’ve done it for a certain amount of years, you walk into a room and it’s like, oh, that child has Williams syndrome,” he said, referring to a genetic disorder that can affect a person’s cognitive abilities and heart.

advertisement

And that’s an incredibly useful skill, even as genetic sequencing becomes more widespread. For one thing, it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place. For another, people in many parts of the world don’t have access to genetic tests at all.

That’s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing. Software that analyzes a patient’s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes.

Some older attempts at facial analysis relied on large, clunky scanners — a tool better suited to a lab, not the field. Now, in the era of smartphones, such efforts have a whole new promise. Face2Gene, a program developed by Boston-based startup FDNA, has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have.

Meanwhile, Muenke and his colleagues at the NIH last month published an important advance: the ability to diagnose disease in a non-Caucasian face.

It’s a promising preliminary sign. But if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses, software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics’ systemic blind spots.

Diagnoses vs. probabilities

The algorithms in general work on the same principles: measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns. They’re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients. The NIH works with partners around the world to collect their photos; FDNA accepts photos uploaded to Face2Gene.

But they differ in a key way: Whereas the algorithm the NIH uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder, the Face2Gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses, but probabilities. The app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the 2,000 disorders for which Face2Gene has image data, based on the overall “look” of the face as well as the presence of certain features. However, the app won’t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of, “Does my patient have a genetic disorder?”

That’s intentional. Face2Gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases — a means to an end.

“We are not a diagnostic tool, and we will never be a diagnostic tool,” said FDNA CEO Dekel Gelbman.

Drawing that bright line between Face2Gene and “a diagnostic tool” allows FDNA to stay compliant with FDA regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone-based diagnostic tools.

Diversity needed

The algorithm the NIH uses — developed by scientists at Children’s National Health System in Washington, D.C., — seems to work pretty well so far: In 129 cases of Down syndrome, it accurately detected the disorder 94 percent of the time. For DiGeorge syndrome, the numbers were even higher: It had a 95 percent accuracy rate across all 156 cases.

Face2Gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology. “Since Face2Gene is a search and reference informational tool, the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output,” Gelbman cautioned.

But there’s one big stumbling block for both of them, a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades: Data for non-white populations is sorely lacking.

“In every single textbook, the ones we had [when I trained] in Germany and the major textbooks here in the US, there are photos of individuals of northern European descent,” Muenke said. “When I told this to my boss, he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds. And there aren’t. There just aren’t.” (Today there is that resource, based on Muenke and the NIH’s work.)

So diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn’t of northern European descent, because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder. Eventually, the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds, too. “We have thought about it but haven’t gone there yet,” Muenke said.

For example, children with Down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges — as do typically developing African or African-American children. Across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose Down syndrome — the angles between landmark points on the child’s nose and eye, according to a paper Muenke and Marius Linguraru at Children’s National published with their colleagues earlier this year. All of the other “typical” features weren’t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls.

In fact, using a Caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice. “One of the findings that I’m very interested in [in] our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others, in terms of facial patterns characteristic of DiGeorge syndrome, was the Caucasian population,” Linguraru said.

To continue to fix this problem, both the NIH and Face2Gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients’ faces — but that’s easier said than done. Confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today, and there are no genetic labs based in Africa registered in the NIH’s Genetic Testing Registry. Asia and South America are also relatively underserved.

Those numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists. “Most practitioners are located in North America and Europe,” Gelbman said. Nigeria, for example, doesn’t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country.

It’s possible that might change, with time and effort. In addition to his work as a researcher, Muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the US for a month-long crash course in medical genetics. (The program is funded by the NIH’s Fogarty International Center; President Trump eliminated funding for the center in his 2018 “skinny” budget proposal announced in March.)

For now, both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set. FDNA scientists published a paper in January showing that their algorithm could better identify Down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces, and Muenke and Linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm’s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds.

As both groups work on recruiting more researchers, they are also working to push their tech forward. FDNA is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach. In theory, these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases.

Meanwhile, Linguraru has his eyes on eventual FDA approval for the algorithm the NIH has used. The ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients.",1

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, April 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists report another step in the use of stem cells to help treat people with debilitating heart failure.

In an early study of 27 patients, Japanese researchers used patients' own muscle stem cells to create a ""patch"" that was placed on the heart.

Over the next year, the patients generally showed small improvements in their symptoms -- including the ability to walk without becoming breathless and fatigued.

However, experts cautioned that while the results are encouraging, there's a lot of work left ahead before stem cells can be used to treat heart failure.

""They've shown that this approach is feasible,"" said Dr. Eiran Gorodeski, a heart failure specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio.

But it's not clear whether the stem-cell tactic was actually effective, said Gorodeski, who was not involved in the study.

That's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells.

So it's possible, Gorodeski explained, that the ""modest"" symptom improvements would have happened anyway. All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted.

Stem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure.

Heart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack.

Symptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms.

In the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart.

That's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart.

The patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University.

He said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections.

To test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet.

The sheet was placed on each patient's heart.

The tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year.

Why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged.

The stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that ""hibernating"" cells in the heart muscle can then function better.

Still, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski.

This type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works.

Those trials are underway, Sawa said.

Other studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure.

Patients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function.

So it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said.

For now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental.

""There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,"" Gorodeski said.

The message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for ""innovative"" ways to improve that treatment.

The study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

"(CNN) An aspirin a day may keep the doctor away. It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer.

Yin Cao, an instructor in the Medicine, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, presented the information Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington.

Cao looked at data from over 86,000 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43,000 men who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012.

Over that 32-year period, over 8,200 women and nearly 4,600 men died of cancer. The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose.

The strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men's risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower.

""Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,"" Cao said. ""It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first.""

Not everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin, but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people.

Rulla Tamimi , the epidemiology chair for the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, thought the presentation was a beneficial one, particularly since scientists are trying to better understand drugs we may all have in our medicine cabinets.

""There has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs,"" Tamimi said in an emailed statement. ""This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Therefore the findings are believed to be very robust, and suggest that aspirin, which is widely available, cheap and has limited toxicity, has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer.""

Studies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had (or are at high risk for) a heart attack or stroke, and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain. Even the ancient Egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago.

In April 2016, the US Preventive Service Task Force said in a final recommendation statement that taking a regular low-dose aspirin a day may prevent colon cancer and cardiovascular disease for adults between 50 and 69 who have a 10% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer.

"NEW YORK -- Three years ago, Tomas Sandoval was looking forward to the birth of his second child when he was diagnosed with a rare form of a blood cancer called lymphoma.

Thomas Sandoval CBS News

Despite chemotherapy and a stem cell transplant, the cancer returned before his daughter’s first birthday.

“Everything is at stake. Being around for my daughter, my son, my wife. Yeah it was a really tough time,” he said.

Sandoval is alive today because of an experimental form of immunotherapy called CAR-T.

Normally, our immune cells are good at killing invaders like bacteria but bad at fighting cancer. With CAR-T, a patient’s own immune cells are removed from the body, reprogrammed to find and destroy cancer cells, then put back into the bloodstream.

On Friday, Moffitt Cancer Center and MD Anderson reported test results of 101 patients with advanced lymphoma who had failed previous therapy and were treated with CAR-T.

“It puts a GPS navigation on the front of the cell so that when they’re infused back in they know where to go and kill the lymphoma,” said Dr. Frederick Locke, who helped lead the trial.

Dr. Frederick Locke CBS News

About eight months after a single treatment, 39 percent of patients had no evidence of cancer.

“That’s actually quite remarkable knowing that at best only one out of 10 of these patients could have complete disappearance of their lymphoma with standard chemotherapy,” Locke said.

Side effects included flu-like symptoms and confusion, and there were three treatment-related deaths.

The FDA will review these results and could make a decision on approval by the end of the year.",1

"There’s another type of prescription drugs, besides opioid painkillers, that’s involved in thousands of drug overdose deaths in the US every year.

The drugs are benzodiazepines, which are widely known by their brand names Xanax and Valium and commonly prescribed to help treat anxiety. These drugs were involved in nearly 9,000 overdose deaths in 2015, according to federal data. But there’s a catch: Such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic, with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids.

A new study published in BMJ looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids. Drawing on a huge sample of nearly 320,000 patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from 2001 and 2013, researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both, and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both.

The study found that among all opioid users, concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose.

The study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose–related emergency room or inpatient visit by 15 percent. If that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well, eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to 2,630 opioid painkiller–related overdose deaths in 2015.

Keith Humphreys, a drug policy expert at Stanford University and one of the authors of the study, said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses: making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren’t also prescribed to benzodiazepines, and vice versa. “Even if we didn’t change opioid prescribing at all, the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just [by] getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time,” Humphreys said.

Yet the study suggests the opposite has happened. From 2001 to 2013, co-prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from 9 percent to 17 percent — a nearly 89 percent jump.

For some patients, eliminating these co-prescriptions could involve some tough trade-offs. If someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety, doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives — to avoid a potentially deadly overdose. (Hopefully while keeping in mind that there’s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain, so opioids aren’t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place.)

There are some caveats to the study. For one, emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren’t a perfect one-to-one proxy for overdoses that didn’t involve a trip to a doctor. The study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines, missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs. And since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period, it’s possible the findings don’t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage. (Although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results.)

Finally, since the study looked at correlation (not causation), it’s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users — perhaps, for whatever reason, these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs.

Still, it’s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other’s overdose risk. So it’s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose — or, conversely, that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose.

Given that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in US history, it’s important — and potentially lifesaving — for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study’s findings.

"What would happen if screening for male infertility was just about as easy as taking a pregnancy test in your home bathroom?

That’s the question researchers at Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Massachusetts General Hospital tried to answer when they went about developing a smartphone-based test that men could use to test their semen in the comfort of their homes.

The test delivered impressive results, identifying abnormal semen samples with approximately 98 percent accuracy according to the researchers, who published their findings Wednesday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

Infertility affects up to 12 percent of the male population worldwide. Though it’s as common as female infertility, it often goes unrecognized due to factors like cultural stigma, the high cost and time required for testing, and access to laboratory facilities.

As things stand now, men have to provide samples “in these specific rooms in hospitals under so much stress and embarrassment,” the study’s principal investigator, Hadi Shafiee, PhD, told CBS News.

His team’s new approach aims to change that with a simple and inexpensive at-home test option.

The smartphone-based test involves several distinct parts: one, a disposable device on which to place the sample, including a disposable microchip that handles the sample; two, an optical attachment that connects to a smartphone; three, an app that guides the user through each step of testing. The researchers say the optical attachment could be created by 3D-printing, and the device would only cost about $5.

The testing kit also includes a tiny weight scale that connects wirelessly to the testing app and measures the total number of sperm swimming in the sample.

The March 22, 2017 cover of the journal Science Translational Medicine depicts a smartphone-based test for male infertility. Gilank Bara Verdana / Ravastra Design Studio, Science Translational Medicine

The researchers tested the device on 350 clinical semen specimens in Massachusetts, including both trained and untrained users in their trial.

“The accuracy of this approach was very similar to that of computer-assisted laboratory analysis, even when it was performed by untrained users with no clinical background,” they wrote in the study.

The app is similar to a fitness tracker, in a sense, in that it stores any history of previous semen samples as well. The app’s user experience is hard to forget: users can see vivid moving images of their sperm right on the screen.

Though the system is in the prototyping stage, it could eventually shake up the world of fertility testing by allowing men to evaluate their sperm in their own homes and helping health centers with fewer resources offer easy, cheap testing.

In addition, the developers say it could also potentially be used by men who have had a vasectomy to monitor their progress at home following surgery. Currently, they’re required to make office visits to a urologist for several months to ensure that the operation was successful.

Shafiee’s team plans to continue refining the test and then file for approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). Several other home-based tests are already on the market, but Boston researchers say their version can analyze additional aspects of the sample, checking how well the sperm move (known as motility) as well as their concentration.

"Many Americans would rather take a drug than change their habits to control a persistent ailment. Yet, every medication has side effects, some of which can be worse than the disease they are meant to treat. Drugs considered safe when first marketed can turn out to have hazards, both bothersome and severe, that become apparent only after millions of people take them for a long enough time.

Such is the case with a popular class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors, or P.P.I.s, now used by more than 15 million Americans and many more people worldwide to counter an increasingly common ailment: acid reflux, which many people refer to as heartburn or indigestion.

These medications are now linked to a growing number of complications, ranging in seriousness from nutrient deficiencies, joint pain and infections to bone fractures, heart attacks and dementia. While definitive evidence for most of the risks identified thus far is lacking, consumers plagued by acid reflux would be wise to consider an alternative approach, namely diet and lifestyle changes that can minimize symptoms and even heal damage already done.

Acid reflux is more than just a nuisance. It involves the backward flow of stomach acid into the tissues above it. It results when the lower esophageal sphincter, a ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach, fails to close tightly enough to prevent the contents of the stomach from moving up instead of down. Sometimes the upper sphincter, between the esophagus and the throat, malfunctions as well.",1
"Taking statins the day of a coronary artery bypass operation may significantly improve survival, a study in the Annals of Thoracic Surgery found.

Researchers looked at 3,021 heart surgery patients, most of whom were taking cholesterol-lowering statins. The 1,788 who continued statins up to the day of surgery had a risk of death within 30 days of 1.7 percent, compared with 2.9 percent for 452 who stopped one to three days before surgery, and 3.8 percent for 781 who did not take statins or stopped more than 72 hours before their operations.

The scientists had no data on how long patients had been taking statins, but only on when they stopped. After controlling for many preoperative health and behavioral characteristics, they found that compared with other patients, those who took statins on the day of surgery had a 48 percent reduced risk of dying in the next 30 days.

“We already knew that people on statins before surgery had a decreased risk of death,” said a co-author, Dr. Yi Deng, an assistant professor of anesthesiology at Baylor College of Medicine. “But there’s never before been data saying how harmful stopping shortly before surgery can be. Unless you have some other reason to stop them, you should take statins right up to the morning of surgery.”",1

"‘‘To new moms: (SUID) was one of my biggest fears and then it happened,’’ said 35-year-old Chauntia Williams, of Maple Heights, Ohio.

Parents are beginning to take baby boxes home from hospitals along with their newborns. A Los Angeles-based company has partnered with health officials to give the boxes away for free and an online initiative offers advice aimed at reducing sudden unexpected infant deaths. New Jersey and Ohio were the first to participate statewide in the program.

TRENTON, N.J. — Cardboard boxes certainly aren’t new technology. But when they’re linked to a practice that started in Finland decades ago to help babies sleep safely, they’re taking on a new purpose as so-called baby boxes make their way to the U.S.

Williams is an advocate for safe sleeping and the boxes after she unexpectedly lost her 33-day-old daughter Aaliyah nine years ago. Williams said her daughter went to sleep in a crib with cushiony bumpers, stuffed animals and an added blanket beneath the fitted sheet and never woke up. She said the coroner determined the bedding caused the death.

She now uses a box with her son, Bryce, though he’s getting a little too big for it. Her message to new parents: Educate yourselves on safe sleep habits.

‘‘Open your mouth and say I’m concerned about this so you can get the assistance,’’ Williams said.

Sudden unexpected infant death is a broad category that includes sudden infant death syndrome and accidental suffocation and strangulation that could come from overcrowded bassinets or cribs. The boxes aren’t the only option for safe sleeping, of course, but health officials say they’re a useful part of a broader safe-sleep education program.

Ohio on Wednesday joined New Jersey in offering the cardboard boxes, which double as bassinets, for free. Each box comes filled with a mattress, fitted sheet, onesie and diapers.

The Baby Box Co. is also handing out the boxes in Minneapolis, Phoenix and San Francisco, with the goal of expanding to all 50 states. The for-profit company also operates in Canada, Ireland and the United Kingdom. Baby Box University, Baby Box Co.’s educational platform, maintains a website that coordinates the educational component of the program.

The idea for baby boxes started in Finland in the 1930s, and is tied to a sharp drop in sudden infant deaths, according to Dr. Kathryn McCans, a pediatrician who chairs New Jersey’s Child Fatality and Near Fatality Review Board. The boxes provide a clutter-free sleep space that has been shown to reduce accidental and unexpected deaths, she said.

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says the U.S. rate of sudden unexpected infant deaths has been declining since the 1990s when public health officials began recommending parents put infants to sleep on their backs. About 3,700 sudden unexpected infant deaths were reported in the country in 2015.

The boxes are a new idea for many Americans.

‘‘The thought of putting the baby in a box, I was like ‘wow that’s weird,’’’ said Dolores Peterson, of Camden, New Jersey, who became a first-time mom recently and was among the first to bring home a box.

Peterson’s daughter, Ariabella, just turned 3 months old. She said the program was eye-opening for how much information she learned about how to prevent sudden unexpected infant death.

McCans says the complimentary items like diapers and onesies are nice, but the more important objective behind the boxes is bringing down infant deaths and grounding parents on safe sleep practices: Place babies on their backs to sleep; Don’t use bumpers in cribs; Keep stuffed animals and blankets out of infants’ sleep spaces; Avoid sleeping in the same bed as infants.

‘‘No one brings their baby into bed with them because they want their baby to die,’’ she said. ‘‘They do it because they want to be nurturing and they are, but it’s not safe.’’

To get the boxes, prospective moms can register through babyboxuniversity.com, watch a handful of videos on sleep safety and pass a quiz. Parents can then take their digital or printed-out certificates to a participating hospital for their boxes. The boxes can also be sent in the mail, if a nearby hospital is not designated as a distribution center.",1
"(Reuters Health) - Improvement or worsening of chest pain symptoms and quality of life after a CT scan of the heart may depend on what the scan finds, a large study suggests.

People who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit, and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed, while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan, researchers found.

Computed tomography coronary angiography (CTCA), is a high-resolution X-ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina, or chest pain, symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed.

“Patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best,” senior study author Dr. David E. Newby from University/BHF Center for Cardiovascular Science in Edinburgh, told Reuters Health.

“This suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and CTCA really helps provide this reassurance. Conversely, knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it, is also very helpful,” he said by email.

Although getting CTCA is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on, its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary, the researchers note in the journal Heart.

Newby and his team assessed how CTCA affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for 4,146 patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease.

When the CTCA results revealed something less than a blockage, so-called nonobstructive disease, as the cause for the patient’s chest pain, patients’ quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months.

This reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment, Newby said.

The findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow-up. Improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions.

“Although CTCA removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks, quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease,” Newby said. “Much like screening tests for cancer, being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better,” he added.

If a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease, he said, then CTCA would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided, treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved.

“If, however, a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy, then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential CTCA findings, including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life-long preventative therapy,” Newby said. “Certainly, this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients, some of whom have declined CTCA.”

“It was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a (treatable) diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis, rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se,” said Dr. Paula M. C. Mommersteeg from the Center of Research on Psychology in Somatic Diseases, Tilburg University, The Netherlands, who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms.

“In my opinion, CTCA does have added value in the diagnostic process (improved decision making), it is less invasive than coronary angiography (CAG), and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients,” Mommersteeg concluded.

"Deep sleep is critical to maintaining a robust memory, but both decline with age. A small new study published in Frontiers in Human Neuroscience suggests that one easy way for older adults to get deeper sleep and stronger memories is to listen to a certain soothing sound called “pink noise”—a mix of high and low frequencies that sounds more balanced and natural than its better-known cousin, “white noise.”

It may sound strange, but previous studies have found that playing so-called pink noise during sleep improves the memory of younger adults. “We wanted to see if it would work in older people, too,” says senior author Dr. Phyllis Zee, professor of neurology at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. Older people tend to get less slow-wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment.

Zee and her fellow researchers had 13 adults ages 60 and older spend two nights in a sleep lab. On both nights, the participants took a memory test at night, went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap, and repeated the memory test in the morning.

On one of those nights, headphone-clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep, spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them. “The noise is fairly pleasant; it kind of resembles a rush of water,” says Zee. “It’s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it’s there, but not enough to disturb sleep.” The sounds were timed to match their slow-wave oscillations. No noise was played during the other night.

(Here’s what pink noise sounded like to study participants, in the box below.)

After analyzing everyone’s sleep waves, the team found that people’s slow-wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise. Come morning, people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night. On the nights without the noise, memory recall did not improve as much.

Northwestern has a patent pending on the new technology, and one of the study authors has cofounded a company that plans to market it commercially. But first, says Zee, larger and longer studies are needed to confirm the findings and show that there are benefits to long-term use, rather than on just one night. The researchers hope to develop an affordable device that people can use at home.

Zee says that the effectiveness of pink noise is all in the timing. “The effect here, at least for memory, is quite related to the ability of the sound stimulus to enhance slow-wave sleep,” she says. “That’s very much tied to what part of the slow wave the stimulus is hitting on.”

That doesn’t mean there aren’t benefits to other soothing background sounds. Music, nature sounds and white (or pink) noise apps may still help improve sleep, she says—which, in itself, is good for the body and for the brain.

"Exercising by doing interval training, not weight lifting, could be the secret to staying young, according to a new study published Tuesday in the medical journal ""Cell Metabolism.""

High-intensity aerobic interval training--or exercising in bursts of moderate and high-intensity running, cycling, or other aerobic activity--may help to reduce the effects of aging at a cellular level, researchers found.

Scientists analyzed three groups of people who were exercising by doing high-intensity aerobic interval training, resistance training, or a combination of the two, over the course of a 12-week period.

While scientists found that all three types of exercise improved participants' lean body mass, at a cellular level, they found that the group participating in the high intensity interval training also saw improvements in the exercise capacity of their muscle's mitochondria. As people age, their mitochondria, which are responsible for producing energy for your cells, become less efficient.

High intensity interval training essentially ""reversed"" many ""age-related differences"" in aspects of elderly participants' mitochondria, the researchers wrote in the study's summary.

Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News' chief health and medical editor, called the study's findings ""very interesting.""

""When they looked at the cellular level, the changes they saw in the older people’s cells with the high-intensity [training] made those cells look more like younger people’s cells in terms of how they handled energy,” Besser said today on ""Good Morning America."" “That was very interesting.”

Chris Powell, trainer and transformation specialist on ABC's “Extreme Weight Loss,"" said the term high-intensity interval training can be ""terrifying"" to people, but it should not be.

""High intensity interval training is just aerobic training with short bouts of weight training in between,"" Powell said today on ""GMA."" ""The beauty of it though is that we get to control the throttle of our own workouts.""

He continued, ""It doesn’t matter if you’re an elite athlete or you haven’t moved for 10 years...It’s all about completing, not competing.""

Besser advised people to consult with their medical doctor before beginning any new exercise regimen, including high-intensity interval training.

This training, also known as HIIT, can be done using just your own body weight and with minimal to no equipment, according to Powell.

Aerobic training can be accomplished by jump roping, running in place or doing jumping jacks or high knees, the trainer said. Weight training can be done with exercises such as push ups, lunges and back squats.

Powell demonstrated a HIIT workout of 20 high knees combined with 10 back lunges.

""It’s that simple,"" he said. ""There’s a million different combinations. You can do it so many different ways.""",1
"Parents of children with autism take note. It may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as 6 months who have older siblings with the disorder, according to a new study by a national network of researchers.

Infants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism, which is typically diagnosed when a child is 2- to 3-years-old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, delayed speech or nonverbal communication.

Researchers used magnetic resonance imaging — or MRI — to scan the brains of 343 infants when they were 6 months, 12 months and 24 months old. Two-thirds of the infants were high risk, having an older sibling with autism. The scans showed that 70 percent of high-risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age 2 had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at 6 and 12 months, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism. Cerebrospinal fluid is a clear, colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine.

This excess fluid “could possibly be an early biological marker for autism,” said Mark Shen, the lead author of the article, published in Biological Psychiatry, and a post-doctoral fellow at the University of North Carolina’s Carolina Institute for Developmental Disabilities. Additional studies are needed to confirm the finding, he said.

Such a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present.

“The earlier we can get biological markers for autism, the earlier intervention can be initiated, and the greater the chance of better outcomes, ” said David Kennedy, Ph.D., co-director of the Child and Adolescent NeuroDevelopment Initiative at the University of Massachusetts Medical School. Typically, therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact, social interactions and communication skills.

The study results are “very exciting,” said Dr. Adriania Di Martino, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at NYU Medical School. Excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism, Di Martino said. It may also be a mechanism in the development of autism, and it opens up new possibilities for research, she said. “You can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid.”

Shen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid. Normally, the liquid, refreshed four times a day, washes away byproducts that build up in the brain. But if the fluid is not flowing properly, these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation, which could “hamper brain development” and lead to autism, said Shen.

Completely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism, said Shen and Dimartino. More studies are needed, they said.

Related: De Niro says 'find the truth on vaccines'. But scientists already did

Parents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain MRIs for younger siblings, Shen said.

“We wouldn’t recommend that every high-risk infant get an MRI until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the 90 percent range” from the current 70 percent, Shen told TODAY.

He and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research. In addition to flushing out the brain’s garbage, brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow. In a study published last month in Nature, 80 percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year, compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism.

“We’re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the 90 percent range, where it could be really clinically useful,” said Shen.

About 1 in 68 children develop autism in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, But as many as 20 out of 100 infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder, said Di Martino.",1

"A Medicine That Blunts The Buzz Of Alcohol Can Help Drinkers Cut Back

Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR

If you drink more alcohol than you want to or should, you're not alone. A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended.

Yet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need.

""The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,"" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

Part of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too.

""I thought my only option was AA,"" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business.

He's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker — a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought ""solace in the bottle,"" he says.

""I wanted to numb my thoughts,"" says John.

He'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day.

He worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him.

""She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,"" he recalls. ""Just absolutely furious.""

He went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services.

""I would say John's story is not unique,"" DeSanto tells us. ""A lot of people are reluctant.""

Sometimes, traditional treatments — such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous — ""can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,"" she explains. ""There's stigma, shame and embarrassment.""

DeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug.

""Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol.

The analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit.

So, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less.

""It blunts the effects of alcohol,"" says Koob. ""People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them.""

That was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. ""I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,"" he says. ""It was startling.""

It's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back.

""This is helping me,"" John says. ""I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy.""

According to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review.

Many physicians are ""unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options.

Any health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone — not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible.

According to the NIAAA, ""patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support.""

Naltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe.

""I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings"" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective.

But there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.",1
New Drugs May Stop Migraines Before They Start,1
"WASHINGTON -- Bacteria live on everyone’s skin, and new research shows some friendly germs produce natural antibiotics that ward off their disease-causing cousins. Now scientists are mixing the good bugs into lotions in hopes of spreading protection.

In one early test, those customized creams guarded five patients with a kind of itchy eczema against risky bacteria that were gathering on their cracked skin, researchers reported Wednesday.

“It’s boosting the body’s overall immune defenses,” said Dr. Richard Gallo, dermatology chairman at the University of California, San Diego, who is leading the work.

End of the road for antibiotics?

We share our bodies with trillions of microbes that live on our skin, in our noses, in the gut. This community — what scientists call the microbiome — plays critical roles in whether we stay healthy or become more vulnerable to various diseases. Learning what makes a healthy microbiome is a huge field of research, and already scientists are altering gut bacteria to fight diarrhea-causing infections.



Wednesday’s research sheds new light on the skin’s microbiome — suggesting that one day it may be possible to restore the right balance of good bugs to treat skin disorders, too.



“It’s a really important paper,” said Dr. Emma Guttman-Yassky of the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai Hospital in New York, who wasn’t involved with the new research. “It does open a window for a potential new treatment.”

Healthy skin harbors a different mix of bacteria than skin damaged by disorders such as atopic dermatitis, the most common form of eczema. Those patches of dry, red, itchy skin are at increased risk of infections, particularly from a worrisome germ known as Staphylococcus aureus.

Gallo’s team took a closer look at how microbes in healthy skin might be keeping that bad staph in check.

They discovered certain strains of some protective bacteria secrete two “antimicrobial peptides,” a type of natural antibiotic. In lab tests and on the surface of animal skin, those substances could selectively kill Staph aureus, and even a drug-resistant strain known as MRSA, without killing neighboring bacteria like regular antibiotics do, the team reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

But those good bugs are rare in the skin of people with atopic dermatitis, Gallo said.

“People with this type of eczema, for some reason that’s not quite known yet, have a lot of bacteria on the skin but it’s the wrong type of bacteria. They’re not producing the antimicrobials they need,” he explained.

Would replenishing the good bugs help? “They’re normal skin bacteria, so we knew they would be safe,” Gallo noted.

FDA fast-tracking ""unbelievable"" eczema drug

His team tested five volunteers with atopic dermatitis who had Staph aureus growing on their skin’s surface — what’s called colonization — but didn’t have an infection. Researchers culled some of the rare protective bacteria from the volunteers’ skin, grew a larger supply and mixed a dose into an over-the-counter moisturizer. Volunteers had the doctored lotion slathered onto one arm and regular moisturizer on the other.

A day later, much of the staph on the treated arms was killed — and in two cases, it was wiped out — compared to the untreated arms, Gallo said.

“We’re encouraged that we see the Staph aureus, which we know makes the disease worse, go away,” he said.

The study couldn’t address the bigger question of whether exposure to the right mix of protective bacteria might improve atopic dermatitis itself, cautioned Mount Sinai’s Guttman-Yassky.

Next-step clinical trials are underway to start testing the effects of longer-term use.",1
"By Steven Reinberg

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, Feb. 20, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Stem cell transplants may halt the progression of aggressive multiple sclerosis (MS) in nearly half of those with the debilitating disease, but picking the right patients for the treatment is key, a new study suggests.

Specifically, younger patients with a relapsing form of MS who were not severely disabled and who hadn't found relief with other treatments fared better than others over five years, the international team of researchers found.

However, in some cases the treatment proved fatal, the researchers reported.

""Stem cell transplantation cannot be considered a cure for MS. However, it can be considered a concrete option for patients showing aggressive MS who have not responded to approved treatments,"" said study co-author Dr. Riccardo Saccardi. He's from the cell therapy and transfusion medicine unit at Careggi University Hospital in Florence, Italy.

Using patients' own stem cells to reboot the immune system is a way to halt the advance of the disease. But the treatment can be risky because the patient's immune system has to be wiped out before the stem cells are transplanted, the researchers said.

In fact, nearly 3 percent of the patients died shortly after receiving the transplant, and those deaths were directly related to the transplant, the researchers reported.

Those deaths are a major concern, one neurologist said, because MS is not in itself life-threatening.

In effect, those patients gambled with a treatment that could be fatal for a disease that isn't, said Dr. Michael Racke, a professor in the department of neurology at Ohio State University.

Racke pointed out that stem cell transplants were first used to treat deadly diseases, such as leukemia, lymphoma and other cancers.

""There may be a population of MS patients that could be identified that might do well with transplant,"" he said. ""It's important to select patients in such a way that they actually get well with the transplant.""

A trial that compares stem cell transplants with other therapies to see whether stem cell transplants can become a treatment for patients who have progressive MS is about to start, added Racke, who co-authored an editorial that accompanied the study.

More than 2 million people in the world suffer from MS, in which the body attacks the central nervous system, according to the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

MS can cause many symptoms, including blurred vision, loss of balance, poor coordination, slurred speech, tremors, numbness, extreme fatigue, problems with memory and concentration, paralysis and blindness.

These symptoms can come and go, or persist and worsen over time. Most people are diagnosed between the ages of 20 and 50, although individuals as young as 2 and as old as 75 have developed the disease, the society says.

Medications can slow the progression of MS and help patients manage symptoms, but there's no cure.

To see how patients did over the long term after stem cell transplants, Saccardi and colleagues followed 281 patients from 13 countries who received stem cell transplants between 1995 and 2006.

The researchers found that 46 percent of the patients experienced progression-free survival at five years after transplant.

Within 100 days of transplant, however, eight patients died (nearly 3 percent). Those deaths were related to the transplants, Saccardi said.

The researchers think these deaths were most likely due to the transplant technology used before 2006, which has since improved.

The report was published online Feb. 20 in the journal JAMA Neurology.

Dr. Paul Wright is chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., and Long Island Jewish Medical Center, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He said, ""As neurologists battle with current therapies that are limited for progressive MS in younger patients, this study provides a possible new avenue for treatment.""

"Yvonne Felix’s eyes don’t work well enough on their own for her to read, recognize faces or cross the street without help. But when the Toronto-based artist and mother puts on a new kind of camera-equipped headgear, she looks at me like no one has before.

The visor that allows legally blind people to see is no longer Star Trek fiction. Leaps in augmented-reality technology are being used to help people with severely low vision gain back enough sight to function, and then some.

Ms. Felix, who has Stargardt disease, wears a device from a company called eSight. The eSight 3—which weighs less than a quarter of a pound and is operated by hand-held remote—captures the world through a camera system and then displays it on OLED screens that sit very close to the eyes. Legally blind people like Ms. Felix have some limited vision, and eSight’s displays are tuned to make use of it. By dialing up contrast and allowing users to zoom in, it can dramatically amplify sight without a surgical procedure.

“Being able to see that people’s pupils actually dilate and contract is quite amazing,” she says. The gear has allowed Ms. Felix to get a desk job and travel on her own. She’s also become a spokeswoman for eSight.

Efforts to make noninvasive vision tech started decades ago with bulky TV-like devices that magnify and increase the contrast on books. In the 1990s, NASA developed space goggles with a camera and two black-and-white cathode-ray-tube screens.

To Star Trek fans, this system recalls the blind “Next Generation” series character who wore a vision visor. “I remember thinking that Geordi La Forge was my hero and that one day there would be something like that and when it came out, I wanted to try it,” says Ms. Felix, who is 36.

The eSight visor, in development for 10 years, is reaching a level of maturity. The third-generation, which debuts this week, weighs less, has a wider field of view and just looks cooler. ESight—along with other makers of head-mounted low-vision aids such as Orcam and Nu-Eyes—is taking advantage of tech that is cheaper, smaller and faster because of popular gadgets like smartphones and virtual-reality headsets.

When Ms. Felix allowed me to try on her visor, the images I saw were very high contrast, and the screens were positioned to allow me to also make use of my natural peripheral vision. The battery lasts about 6½ hours.

Using the hand-held controller, users can zoom and pan, like on a street sign, or plug in a TV feed directly. Because of those capabilities, Ms. Felix said in some cases eSight probably lets her see better than me.

“There is no device that’s a magic solution for all problems,” says Walter Wittich, an assistant professor at the University of Montreal’s School of Optometry, who is part of the first independent research project into the tech. Still, Mr. Wittich says it can be useful for the people with low vision who benefit from magnification, for whom most current options are hand-held.

Not everyone feels equally comfortable operating the gear. Mr. Wittich plans to release initial results from the study in May, and says one thing that is clear is that people who click with eSight immediately see a boost in quality of life. “It is working very well for some people already, and there is still quite a bit of potential in both the design and electronic capability,” he says.

ESight says its tech has worked for about three quarters of the people who have tried it. Their biggest hurdle is getting the technology paid for. They have sold about a thousand to date, and this new visor costs $10,000. While the device has FDA clearance as a Class I medical device, most insurance doesn’t cover it.

“That is a battle we are starting to wage,” says eSight Chief Executive Brian Mech. Some employers and other third parties have picked up the tab, he says, but the challenge is to reach users who have limited resources because their vision challenges keep them from work.

“Yes, that is an expensive piece of equipment, but it can really do a lot for people,” says Gislin Dagnelie, an associate professor of ophthalmology at Johns Hopkins and an adviser to the company. While the National Federation of the Blind estimates there are 1.3 million legally blind people living in the U.S., Mr. Dagnelie thinks at least a hundred thousand people could benefit from eSight’s tech.

For an artist like Ms. Felix, it has offered more than routine improvement. She worked for decades in sculpture and thick paint, because she felt her work as much as she saw it. Her favorite artist was Vincent van Gogh, because he also likely suffered from vision problems.

She recalls the first time she saw “Starry Night” with her eSight visor on, it made her cry. “I saw every little stroke. When I saw the color mixtures and how thick the paint was, it was the most overwhelming moment of my life,” she says. “I thought that never in my life would I be able to see something so beautiful.”

"Cassandra Quave, an Emory University scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices, said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains. The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming.

AD

AD

Instead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another.

“It weakens the bacteria so the mouse’s own defenses work better” to clear the infection, she said. The plant extracts didn't harm the skin tissues or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin.

The discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial-resistant infections, an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high-level United Nations summit last fall.

AD

MRSA has become a serious threat to human health; in 2011, it was responsible for more than 80,000 invasive infections and more than 11,000 deaths in the United States, according to federal statistics.

AD

Antimicrobial resistance refers to infections that have evolved the ability to withstand drugs that ought to stop them. The medicines include antibiotics, which act on bacteria, as well as drugs to fight fungal, viral or parasitic infections. Fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become “superbugs.”

“But instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient,” said Quave.

Plants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries, and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation, which points to their efficacy, she said.

AD

AD

“People don’t save that knowledge over centuries” if something doesn’t work, she said. “We’re trying to answer the question: Does this work against bacteria, and how does it work, and is it safe to use?”

The Brazilian peppertree, a shrubby tree native to South America, is an invasive species throughout the southern United States, particularly in Florida, where it’s sometimes called the Florida holly or broad-leaf peppertree, and is considered a noxious weed. The woody plant has long been a staple in Brazilian traditional medicine. Its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds, ulcers, burns and skin infections, Quave said.

Less is known about the plant’s fruit, which was used traditionally as topical poultices for infected wounds and ulcers.

AD

From an ecological standpoint, Quave said, it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment.

AD

But she said the average person shouldn’t try to use the weed to make their own medicine. “Not everything that is natural is safe,” she said.

Her lab at Emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract. Researchers would still need to conduct pre-clinical trials to test its medicinal benefits.

"“Bariatric surgery is probably the most effective intervention we have in health care,” says Laurie K. Twells, a clinical epidemiologist at Memorial University of Newfoundland. She bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight-loss surgery’s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life.

“I haven’t come across a patient yet who wouldn’t recommend it,” Dr. Twells said in an interview. “Most say they wish they’d done it 10 years sooner.” She explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying — and failing — to lose weight and keep it off. And the reason is not a lack of willpower.

“These patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again,” Dr. Twells said. “The weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months,” often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate, an effect not seen after bariatric surgery, which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract.

In reviewing studies that followed patients for five to 25 years after weight-loss surgery, Dr. Twells and colleagues found major long-lasting benefits to the patients’ health and quality of life. Matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery, those who did fared much better physically, emotionally and socially. They rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility, pain, daily activities, social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety, among other factors that can compromise well-being.",1
"A commonly used drug could dramatically increase survival rates for men who have to fight prostate cancer twice.

The drug, a type of androgen-depleting therapy, is a frontline treatment for men who opt not to have surgery for the cancer. But the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add-on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns.

Androgens, including testosterone, are thought to contribute to the growth and development of prostate cancer. Among men whose cancer showed signs of coming back after their prostate was surgically removed, adding a drug that blocks androgen receptors to radiation treatments halved their death rate from prostate cancer over the subsequent 12 years.

advertisement

The findings should trickle down to clinical settings “pretty quickly,” said Dr. William Shipley, chair of the genitourinary oncology unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and one of the researchers behind the study, which was published Wednesday in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Prostate cancer recurrence happens in about 30 percent of patients after surgery. In these cases, radiation therapy is usually used.

The specific ADT drug used in the study, bicalutamide, has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces. The effect of the newer-generation medications, gonadotropin-releasing hormones, is similar to bicalutamide, according to other trials.

AstraZeneca (AZN), which is one of the makers of bicalutamide, was a sponsor of the study, and one of Shipley’s coauthors has received honoraria and grants from the company.

Because prostate cancer can progress relatively slowly, the study — which ran from 1998 to 2003 — needed an extended follow-up period to be sure of the effects, Shipley said. The men in the trial received the ADT drugs for two years.

The study represents an important, if incremental, step for clinicians, noted Dr. William See, chair of the urology department at the Medical College of Wisconsin, who wasn’t involved in the study. “It really builds on some prior data and combines prior findings to ask and answer a new question that is quite relevant for men affected by prostate cancer.”

Some patients benefitted from adding the drugs more than others. The results were especially dramatic for men who had prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels above .07 ng/ml when they started the trial. (While that is a relatively low level for most men, PSA levels should be close to zero after a prostatectomy.) Men with medium-grade tumors and those who may not have had their entire cancer removed during surgery also survived significantly longer if they received the drug.

However, See and Shipley both noted that looking at those subsets of patients was not what the study was initially designed to do, which limits the statistical power of those conclusions. More research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug.

“You don’t want to treat a patient if he doesn’t need to be treated,” Shipley said.",1
"(Reuters) - Amgen Inc said its potent cholesterol fighter Repatha significantly reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes and death in patients with heart disease, according to initial results of a large, eagerly-anticipated trial released on Thursday. The data should pave the way for greater acceptance by health insurers and pharmacy benefit managers, who have been rejecting about 75 percent of prescriptions written for the expensive medicine despite multiple appeals by physicians.

An Amgen sign is seen at the company's office in South San Francisco, California in this October 21, 2013 file photo. REUTERS/Robert Galbraith/Files

No new safety problems cropped up in the 27,500 patient study called Fourier, Amgen said. It also said Repatha’s effect on mental function was similar to placebo, likely alleviating concerns that it might impair cognition in some patients.

The trial was widely expected to be positive, especially after a smaller study presented in November showed Repatha therapy led to regression of artery-clogging plaque, an underlying cause of heart disease.

“These results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,” Amgen research chief Sean Harper said in a statement.

Details on the magnitude of benefit will be revealed in mid-March at the American College of Cardiology meeting in Washington, D.C. Industry analysts have been looking for a 15 percent to 20 percent reduction of major adverse heart events.

Repatha, with a list price of more than $14,000 a year, was approved based on its ability to dramatically lower “bad” LDL cholesterol in patients who require more intensive therapy on top of widely-used statins, such as Lipitor, or who are unable to tolerate statins.

But those who control budgets wanted concrete proof that the drug could actually reduce the risk of heart attacks and death before making it easier for patients to get the medicine.

Repatha and a rival drug from Regeneron Corp and Sanofi have had endured anemic sales as a result.

Amgen reported just $40 million in third-quarter sales. The company said Repatha would be well on its way to becoming a $1 billion seller if all prescriptions written had been filled.

The primary and secondary goals of the study are composites of several adverse outcomes. At the heart meeting in March, researchers will also provide details on risk reduction for each of the components, such as non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke, and heart-related death.

The primary goal also included need for a new artery-clearing procedure and hospitalization for angina.",1

TUESDAY, Jan. 31, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- A breath test to detect stomach and esophageal cancers shows promise, researchers say.

The test measures five chemicals in the breath. It was 85 percent accurate in detecting these cancers in more than 300 patients, the new study found.

Each year, 1.4 million cases of cancer of the stomach and esophagus (the tube leading from the throat to the stomach) are diagnosed worldwide. Both tend to be diagnosed at a late stage and the five-year survival rate for the two cancers is 15 percent, the researchers said.

Findings from the study were presented Monday at the European Cancer Congress (ECC).

""At present the only way to diagnose esophageal cancer or stomach cancer is with endoscopy. This method is expensive, invasive and has some risk of complications,"" study author Dr. Sheraz Markar said in an ECC news release. Markar is from Imperial College London in England.

With endoscopy, a flexible tube is threaded down a sedated patient's throat to the stomach to view the digestive tract.

""A breath test could be used as a noninvasive, first-line test to reduce the number of unnecessary endoscopies. In the longer term this could also mean earlier diagnosis and treatment, and better survival,"" Markar said.

""Because cancer cells are different to healthy ones, they produce a different mixture of chemicals. This study suggests that we may be able detect these differences and use a breath test to indicate which patients are likely to have cancer of the esophagus and stomach, and which do not,"" he explained.

Markar added that the test needs to be validated in a bigger group before it could be used on patients. The researchers said they are planning a larger trial of the breath test over the next three years.

Study results presented at meetings are generally considered preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"A small study claims children with autism may benefit from fecal transplants, which involves introducing donated microbes into people with gastrointestinal disease to rebalance the gut. The Ohio State University, Northern Arizona University and Arizona State University researchers found a parallel between behavioral symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal distress, and improvements to both after fecal transplant.

“Transplants are working for people with other gastrointestinal problems,” lead study author Ann Gregory, a microbiology graduate student at The Ohio state University, said in a news release. “And, with autism, gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe, so we thought this could be potentially valuable.

The researchers built off of previous findings that children with autism typically have fewer types of important bacteria in their guts and less bacterial diversity overall. The research team surmises the disparity is due to antibiotics prescribed within the first three years of life.

The study, which was published in the journal Microbiome, included 18 children with autism and moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. The children ranged from 7 to 16 years old. A questionnaire was used to assess social skills, irritability, hyperactivity and communication. Parents and doctors reported improvements that lasted at least eight weeks after treatment. Children without autism were used as a control for the study, the news release reported.

On average, the score on a scale for ranking gastrointestinal symptoms dropped 82 percent from the beginning to the end of treatment, while average developmental age increased by 1.4 years, according to the release. Researchers also asked the children’s doctors to perform pre- and post-diagnostic evaluations, which suggested lasting benefits.

One of the study’s limitations is its small size, and researchers cautioned that families should not try to replicate the treatment at home.

“We have to be mindful of the placebo effect, and we have to take [the findings] with a grain of salt,” Matthew Sullivan, an associate professor of microbiology at The Ohio State University, said in the release. “But it does give us hope.”",1

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 25, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Just how successful is the procedure called catheter ablation at fixing irregular heartbeats that can be potentially fatal?

Pretty successful, a new study found, but there are caveats.

Burning or freezing specific areas of the heart can alleviate the common irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation in 74 percent of patients. However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report.

Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained.

About 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association.

For those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended.

""Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,"" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo.

But the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain.

Complications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said.

In addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained.

During the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium.

The burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said.

According to Dr. Hugh Calkins, ""Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results."" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore.

The complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said.

""Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,"" Calkins said. ""For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,"" he added.

The new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation.

Ablation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure.

According to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life.

Atrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later.

About 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said.

After the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested.

The study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them.

Dr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, ""Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging.""

In certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted.

""Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,"" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study.

""Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,"" he suggested.

Catheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said.

The report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.

"Kangaroo Care Helps Preemies And Full Term Babies, Too

Enlarge this image toggle caption Morgan Walker for NPR Morgan Walker for NPR

When Ali Andrew Li was born on Jan. 7, he was gently placed on his mother's chest, where doctors cleaned and examined him and covered him with a warm blanket.

""I just loved it,"" his mother, Salma Shabaik, a family physician who lives in Los Angeles, says. ""It was really nice to have the baby right there beneath my eyes where I could feel him, touch him, kiss him.""

That was different than the birth of her son Elias two years ago; he was whisked away to a bassinet to be examined. And unlike Elias, who cried a lot after delivery, Shabaik says Ali stopped crying ""within seconds"" after being placed on her chest.

Kangaroo mother care has been widely used worldwide to care for premature babies, and it's gaining popularity in caring for healthy full term babies like Ali as well. It is as it sounds: Like a kangaroo's pouch, mothers hold their naked newborns on their bare chest for the first few hours of life.

At Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center where Ali was born, the technique is routinely practiced for healthy mothers and newborns. The baby gets to know their mother immediately, says Dr. Larry Gray, behavioral and developmental pediatrician at Comer Children's Hospital, University of Chicago Medicine. ""The baby gets landed in a trusting environment,"" he says, reassuring them that life outside the womb can also be ""soft, comfortable and warm.""

Enlarge this image toggle caption Morgan Walker for NPR Morgan Walker for NPR

The benefits are many, according to Dr. Lydia Kyung-Min Lee, an ob-gyn at UCLA. Not only is the baby happier, she says, but his or her vitals are more stable. Body temperature, heart and breathing rate normalize more quickly. The close contact also allows the baby to be exposed to the same bacteria as the mother, which can protect against allergies and infection in the future. Infants who receive kangaroo care breast feed more easily, Lee says, and their mothers tend to breast feed for longer periods of time, which is ""all good.""

Babies also seem to suffer less pain. Almost 20 years ago, Gray studied how babies respond to a heel prick to draw blood, a procedure that screens newborns for genetic disorders. He found that when healthy newborns had kangaroo care, there was less facial grimacing and crying suggesting pain, compared to babies who had been swaddled and had the procedure in their bassinets, ""sort of alone.""

One of the first places to show how this technique can help preemies was Colombia in the 1990s. There, hospitals with no access to incubators and other equipment often sent home preemies with no expectation that they would live. But doctors were surprised to see that babies whose mothers carried them close, skin to skin, not only survived but thrived.

This was a ""serendipitous magical finding,"" says Gray, suggesting that skin-to-skin contact acted something like a ""natural incubator.""

Gray also points to the work of Myron Hofer, a psychiatrist with Columbia University Medical Center who studies attachment between mother and infants. Hofer coined the term ""hidden regulators"" that pass between mother and baby. It's not just that mother and baby are together, Gray says, but also that the mother is in some way ""programming the baby, the breathing, temperature and heart rate.""

That ""magic"" can also happen between baby and father, too, says Gray, if there's skin-to-skin contact. And if mothers or babies are very sick and have to be isolated, Gray suggests mothers take any opportunity to hold their infant skin to skin. Even a little bit of kangaroo contact, he says, can be beneficial.",1
"""It's clear that these medications are beneficial,"" said Wadden, who has been a paid consultant to pharmaceutical companies as well as Weight Watchers. ""Unfortunately, there's a sense that they must not work if you have to take them indefinitely. But I think obesity medications should be used on a long-term basis for chronic weight management, just as I take a [cholesterol-lowering] statin and a blood-pressure medication for the long term.""",1

TUESDAY, Jan. 17, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Because of stringent tonsillectomy guidelines, some kids who could benefit from tonsil removal surgery aren't getting it, two new reviews suggest.

To qualify for the surgery, a child must have many recurring throat infections within a short span of time or severe sleep disturbances, said Dr. Sivakumar Chinnadurai, a co-author of the reviews.

An evaluation of current medical evidence suggests more kids would receive significant short-term improvement in their daily life if the guidelines were relaxed, said Chinnadurai, a pediatric otolaryngologist with Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville.

Children experienced nearly half as many sore throats when they underwent a tonsillectomy, even if they didn't meet the guidelines, Chinnadurai and his colleagues found. The kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care.

However, this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery, Chinnadurai said. By the third year, there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections. Also, there was limited research on long-term results.

""The decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they're suffering with,"" Chinnadurai said. Kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery, he said.

There's an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils, Chinnadurai said.

""In a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea, we can see a benefit in sleep-related quality of life,"" he said. The kids get better sleep, and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school.

The medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades.

Tonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on U.S. children, with 530,000 such procedures completed each year, according to the American Academy of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.

Thirty years ago, nine out of 10 tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections. These days, the procedure is done 20 percent of the time for infections and 80 percent of the time for sleep problems, according to the academy.

Swollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep, causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea, the researchers said in background notes.

Guidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year; five or more sore throats two years running, or three or more sore throats for three years in a row, according to the background notes.

The researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent, ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don't meet the high threshold of recurring infections, Chinnadurai said.

There aren't strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders, so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so-called watchful waiting -- monitoring the situation.

The study results showed ""there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals,"" said Dr. Alyssa Hackett, an otolaryngologist with the New York Eye and Ear Infirmary of Mount Sinai in New York City.

""In the right child with the right indications, these are really wonderful procedures that can be life-changing for both the child and the family,"" said Hackett, who wasn't involved with the new research.

""If you need your appendix out, you need your appendix out,"" Hackett said. ""But for the tonsils and adenoids, there are great quality-of-life benefits that are evident for the surgery, but no child has ever died because they haven't gone through the surgery."" (Adenoids, glands at the roof of the mouth, are often removed along with tonsils.)

Still, Chinnadurai and Hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat.

About 3 percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two-week recovery period, Hackett said.

""Though a tonsillectomy is low-risk, it is not risk-free, and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child,"" Chinnadurai said.

""We're talking about a child who has significant sleep-related issues,"" Hackett said. ""We don't want people to say my child snores, they need to have their tonsils out. That's not what this study says at all.""

The two reports were published online Jan. 17 in the journal Pediatrics.

"Like spicy foods? If so, science has some good news for you: Eating hot chili peppers may help you live longer.

A new study, published in PLoS ONE, found that consumption of hot red chili peppers was associated with a 13 percent lower risk of death.

The research is observational, so no cause and effect relationship can be established. Still, the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life.

For the study, researchers at the Larner College of Medicine at the University of Vermont analyzed data on more than 16,000 Americans using the National Health and Nutritional Examination Survey (NHANES). Participants were followed for an average of 18.9 years.

The researchers note that people who ate hot red chili peppers tended to be “younger, male, white, Mexican-American, married, and to smoke cigarettes, drink alcohol, and consume more vegetables and meats . . . had lower HDL-cholesterol, lower income, and less education,” in comparison to participants who did not consume red chili peppers.

Though the mechanism by which chili peppers could help delay death is not well understood, there are some theories.

Previous, mostly experimental research has suggested that spices and their bioactive ingredient, capsaicin, have anti-obesity, antioxidant, anti-inflammation and anti-cancer properties.

The authors say capsaicin also possesses antimicrobial properties that “may indirectly affect the host by altering the gut microbiota.”

The research corroborates a 2015 study conducted in China and published in the BMJ that found regular consumption of spicy food is associated with a lower risk of death.

But experts caution that this doesn’t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity. People with gastrointestinal issues, for example, should hold off on the hot sauce.

“For those who are affected by digestive disorders such as a stomach ulcer, I would be cautious about eating spicy foods,” Lu Qi, of Harvard’s T. H. Chan School of Public Health and Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston, and lead author of The BMJ study, told CBS News.

The authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes.

“Such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health, updated dietary recommendations, and the development of new therapies,” they write.",1
"To the age-old question “Is coffee bad for you?”, researchers are in more agreement than ever that the answer is a resounding “no.” A new study published in the journal Nature Medicine found that older people with low levels of inflammation — which drives many, if not most, major diseases — had something surprising in common: they were all caffeine drinkers.

“The more caffeine people consumed, the more protected they were against a chronic state of inflammation,” says study author David Furman, consulting associate professor at the Institute for Immunity, Transplantation and Infection at Stanford University. “There was no boundary, apparently.”

In the study, Furman and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from 100 young and old people. The older people tended to have more activity in several inflammation-related genes compared with the younger group — no surprise, since as people get older, inflammation throughout the body tends to rise. Chronic diseases of aging, like diabetes, hypertension, heart problems, cancer, joint disorders and Alzheimer’s, are all believed to have inflammation in common. “Most of the diseases of aging are not really diseases of aging, per se, but rather diseases of inflammation,” Furman says. The more active these genes were, the more likely the person was to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis.

What’s more, even among older people, those with lower levels of these factors were more protected against inflammation — and they had something else in common too. They all drank caffeine regularly. People who drank more than five cups of coffee a day showed extremely low levels of activity in the inflammatory gene pathway. Caffeine inhibits this circuit and turns the inflammatory pathway off, the researchers say.

The goal isn’t to make every trace of inflammation disappear, the scientists stress. In fact, inflammation is an important function of the immune system, which uses it to fight off infections and remove potentially toxic compounds. But with aging, the process isn’t regulated as well as it is in a younger body. “Clearly in aging something is breaking down, and we become less effective at managing this inflammation,” says Mark Davis, director of the Stanford institute. “But now in this paper, we identify a particular pathway that was not associated with inflammation before. We are able to point, with a much higher resolution picture, at aging and the things that should be markers for inflammation.”

The key will be to figure out when the inflammatory response starts to spiral out of control. In an upcoming study, Furman and others will soon investigate the immune systems of 1,000 people; he hopes to use that information to develop a reference range of immune-system components to tell people whether their levels are normal, or if they’re at higher risk for developing chronic conditions driven by inflammation.

In the meantime, following the example of caffeine-drinking adults with lower levels of inflammation — by having a cup of joe or two — might be a good idea.

"On a scale of 1 to 10, lower back pain can register somewhere between ""I need an aspirin"" to “please jack me up with morphine.”

Those suffering from such discomfort might feel moderate to mild pain that is not debilitating. In severe cases, they could feel like a giant electrified claw has claimed the lower part of their back, tearing into each nerve in that part of the body. The smallest of movements – getting up from a chair, walking or even coughing – can feel torturous. Maybe the lower back is as stiff as hardened concrete and as sensitive as an exposed nerve.

A simple lumbar support device, or back brace, can provide short-term relief, research shows, according to an analysis of 28 studies published in the September 2016 issue of the Annals of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine journal. While these devices won’t cure the underlying condition, they're simple and relatively inexpensive. In the 2016 meta-analysis, researchers concluded that lumbar support devices are useful for improving function and reducing pain among those suffering from subacute back pain, which means it's past the acute stage – which is sudden and short in duration – but not long-lasting enough to be chronic.

“Lumbar support devices provide enough compression and support for the lower back to allow healing to occur,” says Christopher Cousins, a physical therapist based in the District of Columbia. “The compression on the abdomen means there’s less pressure on your lower back discs, ligaments, muscles and spine.”

Lumbar devices typically fit around your waist and are secured with Velcro. They often have a steel or plastic plate attached to the section that would press against the patient’s lower back to provide support; some have over-the-shoulders straps. Most over-the-counter lumbar support devices cost between $25 and $130, and they're available at many drug stores, Target and Wal-Mart, plus online without a a prescription. Custom-made lumbar support devices, which are contoured to the natural curvature of the patient’s spine, cost from a few hundred dollars to about $1,000, Cousins says.

People who suffer mild to moderate subacute back pain should put on a back brace as soon as their discomfort sets in, says Scott Bautch, a chiropractor in Wasau, Wisconsin, and president of the American Chiropractic Association's council on occupational health. ""You want to give yourself bracing so you can move,"" Bautch says. ""Inactivity or immobilization is the worst thing for a back. You want to remain active, and a brace can help you do that.""

Some studies have shown that wearing a lumbar support device could lead to negative effects, such as skin lesions, muscle wasting, gastrointestinal disorders, higher blood pressure and higher heart rates. Those issues are rare and typically occur with people who wear a back brace for an extended period of time, for more than the week or two most experts recommend, Bautch says. If a back brace fits well, is worn properly – that is, it's not too snug – and is not overused, it shouldn't create any health problems, Bautch says. During the course of his 30-year career, Bautch says, hundreds of his patients have worn lumbar support devices. None of them developed any problems, aside from a handful who had minor skin irritation where part of the brace rubbed their body, Bautch says. He remedied that issue by having his patients wear an undershirt between the lumbar support device and their skin.

Searing, subacute back pain is caused by an array of conditions, including a herniated disc, in which the soft, jelly-like center inside the disc pushes out through a tear in its tough exterior and irritates nerves. A herniated disc can cause sciatica, a painful condition that affects the back, hips and legs and is caused by the compression of a spinal nerve root in the lower back. Spinal discs degenerate with age, and a herniated disc can occur without a physical injury, says Dr. Neel Anand, director of spine trauma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ""Think of your disc like your car tire – it's going to wear out,"" Anand says.

Before getting a lumbar support device for your lower back pain, experts recommend these steps:

1. If you have severe pain, see a physician quickly. If your back pain or stiffness is so bad you can't move without tremendous discomfort, see a doctor as soon as possible, Bautch says. If your pain and stiffness are that severe, a back brace may not be of much immediate use, he says, adding that it may be helpful once the pain and stiffness subside to a tolerable level where you can move.

Moderate to mild lower back pain often subsides after five days or so, but if your discomfort persists beyond that or worsens, see a doctor, adds Dr. Megan Cortazzo, medical director of clinical documentation improvement and health information management at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A doctor can test for and rule out serious potential causes, such as kidney stones, an abdominal aneurysm and cancer, Cortazzo says. Doctors can order an array of tests, such as an X-ray, MRI or CT scan, to arrive at the correct diagnosis, which will help lead to the most effective treatment plan, she says. The goal of most treatment regimens is strengthening the patient's core muscles supporting the spine so the pain doesn't recur. Treatment could include physical therapy, a stretching routine, yoga or Pilates. Many people also find chiropractic adjustments helpful, says Robert Hayden, a chiropractor based in Griffin, Georgia.

2. Find a lumbar support device that fits you. Once you've been diagnosed, look for a lumbar support device that fits the natural curvature of your spine, says Dr. Jeremy Smith, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Irvine, California. Try on a few at the store before buying one, he advises. If you buy the device online, you can return it if it doesn't fit. “It needs to naturally contour and fit, kind of like a glove, so all surface areas are in contact with your back. It should help remind you to keep good posture,” Smith says. “The device should be snug, but not too tight. It shouldn’t constrict your breathing.”

3. Don’t become reliant on your back brace. Patients should wear a back brace for no longer than a few days to two weeks at the most, Bautch says. “Longer than that, and your muscles start to adapt and get accustomed to the brace, which means they can lose strength, which can lead to more injuries,” he adds. “If you use the back brace for more than two weeks, you can become brace-dependent.” A lumbar support device can be useful in the short term, but strengthening the core muscles that support your back is important in the long run, Bautch says.

4. Learn your capacity. Figure out your physical limits to avoid reinjuring your back – both when you're wearing a back brace and after you've stopped using it, says Robert Shapiro, a physical therapist and certified orthopedic manual therapist based in Huntington, New York. ""You're not Superman when you're wearing your brace,"" he says. Exceeding your physical boundaries could cause a recurrence of low back pain. “You have to learn what your limits are and not to exceed them,” Shapiro says. “You may be able to lift a box of books, but shoveling snow may cause pain. Your physical limits may change as you exercise and strengthen your core.”",1
"Using the immune system to beat cancer is quickly becoming a promising new strategy for battling tumors. But most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias. Immunotherapy, as it’s called, has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast, prostate, lung, colon and brain cancers.

But in a report published in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers led by Dr. Behnam Badie from the City of Hope Beckman Research Institute and Medical Center say that the same immune-based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer.

The 50-year-old man with glioblastoma, a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor, had already been treated with surgery, radiation and anti-tumor drug therapies. Despite these treatments, his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord. Badie and his team extracted immune cells from him, then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells. After surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor, Badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells (called chimeric antigen receptor T cells, or CAR T cells) six times, and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing.

Other smaller growths in the brain continued to grow, however, so the patient received 10 more doses of the CAR T cells injected into the cavities in the brain, called the ventricles. This is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions, because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation. The man did not develop such serious complications, however, and after about four months, these tumors too started to shrink. By six months, almost all had disappeared.

If the patient had not received the CAR T therapy, he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred, says Badie. But after being treated with the immune therapy, his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months. “If we can do the same for other patients, that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done,” says Badie, whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma.

The patient is one of nine in the trial, and so far, many of the other people are having similar experiences on the therapy. Based on this man’s case, his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain, since that may help control spread of the cancer.

It’s also becoming clear that more than one type of modified immune cells may have to be enlisted. The tumors in the first patient remained under control for almost eight months, but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain. Badie says it’s not obvious why, but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the CAR T cells that were injected. It’s possible that the immune cells had destroyed most of the cancer cells expressing the original protein, so other cancer cells with other proteins began to proliferate and survive.

Badie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor-targeting proteins. Eventually, these proteins would also be tailored to be specific to each patient’s cancer — a precision medicine approach to controlling cancer. These results are the first encouraging sign that the immunotherapy that is helping more people with blood cancer might also be effective for people with solid tumors like brain cancers.

"WEDNESDAY, Dec. 21, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A shorter period of antibiotic treatment for ear infections in young children does more harm than good, a new study finds.

About three-quarters of children have ear infections in their first year of life. These infections are the most common reason why children are given antibiotics, the University of Pittsburgh researchers noted.

""Given significant concerns regarding overuse of antibiotics and increased antibiotic resistance, we conducted this trial to see if reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment would be equally effective along with decreased antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse reactions,"" Dr. Alejandro Hoberman said in a university news release. Hoberman is chief of the general academic pediatrics division at Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh of UPMC.

The study included 520 youngsters with ear infections. The children ranged in age from 9 months to 23 months, and were randomly selected to receive either a standard 10-day course of antibiotics or a shortened five-day course of antibiotics followed by five days of placebos.

The risk of treatment failure was 34 percent in the five-day group and 16 percent in the 10-day group. What's more, the children in the five-day group didn't have a lower risk of antibiotic resistance or of side effects such as diarrhea or diaper rash.

""The results of this study clearly show that for treating ear infections in children between 9 and 23 months of age, a five-day course of antibiotic offers no benefit in terms of adverse events or antibiotic resistance,"" Hoberman said.

""Though we should be rightly concerned about the emergence of resistance overall for this condition, the benefits of the 10-day regimen greatly outweigh the risks,"" he added.

The study was published Dec. 21 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

"LONDON (Reuters) - A non-surgical treatment for low-risk prostate cancer in which doctors inject a light-sensitive drug derived from deep-sea bacteria into a patient’s bloodstream was shown in a trial to kill cancer cells without destroying healthy tissue.

Results of a trial in 413 patients showed that the drug, which is activated with a laser to destroy tumor tissue in the prostate, was so effective that half the patients went into remission, compared with 13.5 percent in a control group.

“These results are excellent news for men with early localized prostate cancer, offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate,” said Mark Emberton, a University College London consultant urologist who led the trial. “This is truly a huge leap forward.”

The treatment, called vascular-targeted photodynamic therapy or VTP, was developed by scientists at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel in collaboration with the privately-owned STEBA Biotech.

The light-sensitive drug used, called WST11, is derived from bacteria found at the bottom of the ocean. To survive with very little sunlight, they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency, Emberton’s team said in a study published in the journal Lancet Oncology.

The Weizmann scientists exploited this feature to develop WST11, a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light.

Men with low-risk prostate cancer are currently put under active surveillance, where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe. Radical therapy, which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate, has significant long-term side effects so is only used to treat high-risk cancers.

While radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and incontinence, VTP only caused short-term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months, the researchers said. No significant side-effects remained after two years.

In the trial, only 6 percent of patients treated with VTP needed radical therapy compared with 30 percent of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance.

The trial involved 47 treatment sites in 10 European countries, most of which were performing VTP for the first time.

“The fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non-specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable,” Emberton said.

The VTP treatment is now being reviewed by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) for possible license, but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely.",0
"Old age is not necessarily a barrier to kidney donation.

A new study has found a kidney transplanted from a deceased 79-year-old can be as effective as one from a person 30 years younger.

Generally, guidelines classify donors older than 50 as “extended criteria donors,” but shortages have led to using these donors more frequently.

Italian researchers retrospectively studied 647 kidney transplants, grouping the donors according to whether they were in their 50s, 60s, 70s or 80s. Recipients were at most seven years older or younger than the donors. The study is in the Clinical Journal of the American Society of Nephrology.

In an average follow-up of five years, they found that the rate of unusable donor kidneys and the long-term outcomes of recipients varied little among the first three age groups — around 18 percent of the organs had to be discarded, and the five-year survival was about 88 percent",1

"Pets Help People Manage The Pain Of Serious Mental Illness

Enlarge this image toggle caption Gary John Norman/Getty Images Gary John Norman/Getty Images

Any pet owner will tell you that their animal companions comfort and sustain them when life gets rough. This may be especially true for people with serious mental illness, a study finds. When people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition, many said it was pets that helped the most.

""When I'm feeling really low they are wonderful because they won't leave my side for two days,"" one study participant with two dogs and two cats, ""They just stay with me until I am ready to come out of it.""

Another person said of their pet birds: ""If I didn't have my pets I think I would be on my own. You know what I mean, so it's — it's nice to come home and, you know, listen to the birds singing and that, you know.""

Many people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system, says Helen Brooks, a mental health researcher at University of Manchester in the United Kingdom and the lead author on the study, which was published Friday in the journal BMC Psychiatry. So they're doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions.

Brooks says, ""Many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren't available from friends and family.""

Brooks and her colleagues interviewed 54 people with serious long-term mental illnesses. Twenty-five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network. The scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice, where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days.

The participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant. They were asked to write the people, places and things that gave them support into the circles, with the circles closest to the center being the most important.

Sixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central, most important circle — the same place many people put close family and social workers. 20 percent placed pets in the second circle.

The interviews with participants are poignant, and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness.

""I think it's really hard when you haven't had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is [like],"" said one participant. ""There's like a chasm, deep chasm between us ... [Other people are] on one side of it, and we're on the other side of it. We're sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don't always — we don't always understand.""

People with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends. For many of these people, says Brooks, animals can break through the isolation. They give affection without needing to understand the disorder.

""[Pets] don't look at the scars on your arms,"" one participant said. ""They don't question where you've been.""

The pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship, participants said. The animals also could distract them from their illness, even from severe psychosis.

One study participant placed birds in his closest social circle. When he was hearing voices, he said that they ""help me in the sense, you know, I'm not thinking about the voices, I'm just thinking of when I hear the birds singing.""

Another participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations.

And having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world. ""They force me, the cats force me to sort of still be involved,"" said one participant.

Another said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people. ""That surprised me, you know, the amount of people that stop and talk to him, and that, yeah, it cheers me up with him. I haven't got much in my life, but he's quite good, yeah.""

""The routine these pets provide is really important for people,"" says Brooks. ""Getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them, giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won't otherwise have.""

Many of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness, she notes. Having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them.

Mark Longsjo, the program director of adult services at McLean Southeast, an inpatient mental facility in Middleborough, Mass., says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences. ""We have so many patients come through, and we always ask them about their support system. Sometimes its family members, sometimes its friends, but it's very common to hear about pets.""

When he does patient intake surveys, Longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments. Patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking, because they know their pets depend on them.

The social workers at McLean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning, encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine. ""I think there's significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one's family in the course of their treatment,"" says Longsjo. He feels this study is important because, although there's a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals, they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients.

Brooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness. Many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most, and were able to provide it — just like the owners took care of them.

As one person in the study said, ""When he comes up and sits beside you on a night, it's different, you know. It's just, like, he needs me as much as I need him.""",1
"Having an optimistic outlook on life may do more than just boost your mood. It may actually help you live longer, according to new research from the Harvard T.H. Chan School of Public Health.

The study, published in the American Journal of Epidemiology, found that women who were optimistic had a significantly lower risk of dying from several major diseases, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, and respiratory disease, compared to other women whose outlook on life was less positive.

“Optimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes, particularly in cardiovascular disease,” postdoctoral research fellow Kaitlin Hagan, co-lead author of the study, told CBS News. “So in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all-cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality, or whether there’s an independent effect of optimism on mortality.”

For the study, the researchers analyzed data on from 2004 to 2012 on 70,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study, a long-running research project tracking women’s health via surveys every two years.

To measure levels of optimism, participants were asked to use a five-point scale to either agree or disagree with six statements, such as, “In uncertain times, I usually expect the best.”

The results showed that the most optimistic women – those in the top 25 percent – had a nearly 30 percent lower risk of dying from any of the diseases analyzed in the study when compared to the least optimistic participants in the lowest 25 percent.

Specifically, the researchers found that the most optimistic women had:

a 16 percent lower risk of dying from cancer.

a 38 percent lower risk of dying from heart disease.

a 39 percent lower risk of dying from stroke.

a 38 percent lower risk of dying from respiratory disease.

The researchers controlled for a number of factors that could have had an impact on lifespan, including marital status, education level, and other socioeconomic factors.

While the study is observational and cannot prove a cause-and-effect relationship between optimism and a longer life, the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection.

“It’s a combination,” Hagan said. “If you’re more optimistic, you tend to have healthier behaviors. Optimistic people are likely to have better diets, they’re exercising more, and they’re getting better sleep.”

However, even after the researchers accounted for these factors, the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life.

“So it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning,” Hagan said. “Optimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels, so there could be an independent effect on optimism.”

She said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research.

The authors point out that since the study was only done in women, who were mainly white, the results might not be generalizable to other populations. However, they note, “there is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race.”

Finally, the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they’re just not optimistic, it is something that is modifiable. They suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism.

“One is called ‘best possible self,’” Eric Kim, who also co-led the study, told CBS News. “So you think about your different domains of life, whether it’s your personal relationship, your spouse, your career, your friendships, and in each of those domains you think about the best possible outcome.”

Hagan had some suggestions, too. “Simple things like thinking about what you’re grateful for every day or writing down what things make you happy or what things you’re looking forward to can help someone to increase their optimism, which can improve health outcomes as we’ve seen here,” she said.",1
"Strobe lighting has been shown to reduce levels of the toxic proteins seen in Alzheimer’s disease, in findings that raise the tantalising possibility of future non-invasive treatments for the disease.

The study, in mice, found that exposure to flickering light stimulated brain waves, called gamma oscillations, that are known to be disturbed in Alzheimer’s patients. Boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain’s immune cells, prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain’s of people with Alzheimer’s.

The authors caution that a “big if” remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans – and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved.

“If humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment, I would say the potential is just enormous, because it’s so non-invasive, and it’s so accessible,” said Li-Huei Tsai, director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory at MIT, and the paper’s senior author.

Alzheimer’s research has faced a number of major setbacks – most recently the failure of Eli Lily’s drug trial – after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients.

The latest intervention, scientists predict, should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals, which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined.

The study, published on Wednesday in the journal Nature, hinges on the observation that Alzheimer’s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity, known as gamma oscillations, which is linked to attention and memory.



To restore the activity, the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light. The technique, known as optogenetics, allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice.



After an hour of stimulation, the researchers found a roughly 50% reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus, the brain’s memory centre. Closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia, the brain’s immune cells.

In a healthy brain, microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors, surveying the local environment, clearing up unwanted compounds, but in Alzheimer’s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead. Strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state.

Next, the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non-invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light. At 40Hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be “not offensive at all” for a person to have in the background.

After being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week, the scientists saw a 60% reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice.

Ed Mann, an associate professor of neuroscience at the University of Oxford, said: “I was surprised, and it’s exciting, that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour.”

Questions remain, however, about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory, which is centred in the hippocampus, or broader cognitive abilities.

David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer’s Research UK, said: “It is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies, but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in Alzheimer’s.”

The authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi-sensory approach, using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs. Tsai and Ed Boyden, a colleague at MIT and co-author, have started a company called Cognito Therapeutics to pursue tests in humans.

"WASHINGTON — Breaking a sweat? Researchers are creating a skin patch that can test those droplets while people exercise and beam results to their smartphones, possibly a new way to track health and fitness.

The experimental gadget goes well beyond activity monitors like the Fitbit. A little larger than a quarter, it’s almost like a tiny lab stuck to the skin — and a study published Wednesday found it worked on sweaty bicyclists, sticking even during a long-distance race in Arizona.

If you think of perspiration as just a drippy nuisance, think again.

“Sweat has biochemical components within it that tell us a lot about physiological health,” said John A. Rogers, who directs Northwestern University’s Center for Bio-Integrated Electronics and led the new research.

Today’s wearable technology helps people track their calories, activity and heart rate. A wearable biosensor would be “radically different,” Rogers said.

For simple fitness purposes, it could give an early warning that it’s time to replenish electrolytes before someone starts to feel dehydrated. But eventually with additional research, Rogers envisions more sophisticated use of such devices, such as real-time monitoring of how the body adjusts during military training, or even to screen people for diseases such as diabetes or cystic fibrosis.

Rogers, who did much of the research while at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, has long worked to develop electronic devices that can stretch and twist with the body. The skin-like sweat patch adds a capability called microfluidics, capturing and analyzing tiny amounts of body fluid.

How it works: Stick the patch on the skin and start moving. Tiny channels collect perspiration and route it to different compartments where it interacts with chemicals that change color to reflect sweat loss, the perspiration’s acidity level, and concentrations of chloride, glucose and lactate.

Together, those measurements can indicate such things as hydration levels or electrolyte loss. Hold a smartphone over the patch, and an app takes a picture of the colors and interprets what they mean.

In two studies reported Wednesday, Rogers’ team stuck patches to the arms and backs of 21 healthy volunteers. Nine rode exercise bikes in a gym to compare the sweat patches’ performance with the decidedly lower-tech method of sweat-testing used today — taping on absorbent pads and carting the resulting wet samples to a laboratory. For a more real-world test, the other 12 bicyclists wore the patches while competing in a long-distance outdoor race in Tucson.

The patches stayed in place and worked even in the challenging outdoor race, and the patches’ biochemical test results agreed with the indoor bikers’ conventional sweat tests, the researchers reported in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

“It seems really practical,” said Stanford University chemical engineering professor Zhenan Bao, who also researches novel biomedical materials but wasn’t involved with the sweat patch. By simply looking at a color change, “such a patch allows people to now have an opportunity to understand their health and how it changes depending on activities.”

It’s a growing field: Other research groups around the country, including some of Bao’s colleagues, are pursuing wearable biosensors.

Rogers’ sweat patches are designed for one-time use over a few hours. While Wednesday’s studies used an early version that analyzed sweat just once during the exercise, he’s now testing a design capable of multiple measurements over time.

"Older Patients Can Benefit From Lung Cancer Surgery

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Rubenstein for NPR Michael Rubenstein for NPR

Every year when Morton Pollner had his checkup, he worried that doctors would find something on his lung. For years, they didn't. Then his luck ran out.

""My reaction was, 'Well, you smoked for 30 years. You got away with it for another 30 years and this is it.' I thought it was a death sentence,"" he says.

Pollner, who lives in Monroe, N.Y., was 76 when he was diagnosed with lung cancer. Like many patients his age, he didn't expect there would be any effective treatment. Lung cancer is the second most common cancer in men and women. And it is mainly a disease of older people. Only about 2 percent of lung cancer patients are under 45 and the average age at diagnosis is about 70.

Older patients are frequently not offered curative treatment like surgery, because they and their families and even their doctors often think they won't be able to tolerate it. So they are referred for supportive care to control symptoms, rather than surgery to remove the cancer.

But many patients can survive and even thrive after surgery, says Dr. Prasad Adusumilli, a thoracic surgeon at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York. He was senior author of a study published in the Journal of Clinical Oncology in October. The study looked at more than 2,000 patients with Stage 1 non-small cell lung cancer who had surgery to remove their tumor. About 70 percent of the patients were 65 years old or older and about 30 percent were at least 75.

And he found that a surprising number of these older patients did quite well. One year after surgery, more people had died from other causes than died from lung cancer. And, after five years, almost 9 out of 10 patients were alive and cancer free.

""They did well and beat their lung cancer,"" Adusumilli says, proving that when it comes to surgery for early stage lung cancer, age should not be a limiting factor.

This was the case for Morton Pollner, who is one of Adusumilli's patients. His cancer had not spread, and Adusumilli told him there was a good possibility the cancerous tissue could be completely removed and he could go back to leading a normal life. That was seven years ago. Today, Pollner is 82, cancer free and enjoying life.

""Whatever I get from here on, it's like gravy,"" he says.

Surgery isn't the answer for all older lung cancer patients, according to Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. Patients with heart or other health problems may not be candidates. At the same time, he says it's important to recognize that patterns of aging have changed over the past two decades.

Seventy today is not the same as it was 20 years ago, Lichtenfeld says. Older adults are more functional, both physically and mentally, than ever before, and he says the medical community needs to adjust its thinking about what treatments older cancer patients can tolerate.

""We shouldn't allow numerical age to be the deciding factor,"" Lichtenfeld says.",1

"The recommendations also support the position of the American College of Cardiology and the American Heart Association, which in 2013 radically shifted their advice from suggesting that doctors focus on the level of a patient’s low-density lipoproteins (LDL) or “bad cholesterol” to looking at a more comprehensive picture of risk based on things such as weight and blood pressure, as well as lifestyle factors.

“People with no signs, symptoms, or history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk for having a heart attack or stroke,” said Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, who chairs the task force.

AD

AD

The task force, which is made up of independent experts but commissioned by the government, concurred after a comprehensive review of the evidence on the topic determined that a broader evaluation of risk is needed. But it puts a greater emphasis on age than the ACC and AHA did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke. It is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications, which include Lipitor, Crestor and Zocor.

The new guidelines, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, suggests that people ages 40 to 75 who have one or more risk factors — such as high cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes or smoking that put them at a 10 percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next 10 years — should be on statins. The group also said that people with a 7.5 percent to 10 percent risk “may also benefit” but did not definitively recommend they take them. “People in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins,” the task force advised.

AD

AD

In contrast, the ACC and AHA recommend that people with a 7.5 percent or greater risk take the drugs.

Another important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are 76 and older, saying that “the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms.” In a commentary accompanying the recommendations, Philip Greenland and Robert Bonow note that there is “uncertainty and hesitation” in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age 76 if you are already on them.

AD

The task force and AHA groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover. Medicare typically follows USPSTF guidelines in determining coverage and the Affordable Care Act specifies that USPSTF recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers. In the case of statins, this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are 40 to 75 years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a 10 percent or greater risk — but not those with 7.5 to 10 percent risk.

Individual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it, and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy.

There is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk. Last month, National Institutes of Health Director Francis Collins wrote in the journal Lancet that “it’s a force for good.” But Rita Redberg, a cardiologist at the University of California at San Francisco and editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects — which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women — should be taken more seriously.

AD

AD

In an opinion piece Sunday, Redberg and Mitchell Katz, deputy editor of JAMA Internal Medicine, advised everyone to take “a step back” and ask “why this debate is so contentious.” They suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated, that the drugs as an intervention are “weak,” and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete.

“In deciding on any therapy, it is important to understand the risks and benefits, particularly for healthy people,” they wrote.

The two U.S. guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world, including the Canadian Cardiovascular Society (which recommends statins in men 40 and older but only after age 50 in women, and the U.K. National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy). The European Society of Cardiology focuses more on managing LDL.

AD

AD

Statins are among the best-selling drugs in the United States, with a 2011 study showing at least 32 million Americans were taking them. The 2013 ACC and AHA guidelines recommend an estimated 24 million more people should be on them.

The task force’s recommendations come on the heels of an important new study, published Saturday, that shows that people who use statins survive heart attacks better than those who do not. They are more likely to not only get to the hospital and survive until they are discharged but also survive in greater numbers a year after their hospitalization than those who do not use statins.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists in Britain have developed a type of HIV test using a USB stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient’s blood.

The device, created by scientists at Imperial College London and the privately-held U.S. firm DNA Electronics, uses a drop of blood to detect HIV, then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer, laptop or handheld device.

The researchers say the technology, although still in the early stages, could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in a similar way to diabetes patients checking their blood sugar levels.

It could be particularly useful in remote settings to help HIV patients manage their treatment more effectively, since current tests to detect virus levels take at least three days and involve sending a blood sample to a laboratory.

“Monitoring viral load is crucial to the success of HIV treatment. At the moment, testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result,” said Graham Cooke, who co-led the research from the Imperial’s department of medicine.

“We have taken the job done by this equipment, which is the size of a large photocopier, and shrunk it down to a USB chip.”

The test, which uses a mobile phone chip, requires a drop of blood to be placed onto a spot on the USB stick. Any HIV in the sample triggers an acidity change, which the chip transforms into an electrical signal. This is sent to the USB stick, which shows the result on a computer or electronic device.

Published in the journal Scientific Reports, results showed the stick test was 95 percent accurate over 991 blood samples, and the average time to produce a reading was 20.8 minutes.

Some 36 million people worldwide are infected with the human deficiency virus (HIV) that causes AIDS, and the majority of them live in sub-Saharan Africa.

Current AIDS drugs, called anti-retrovirals, reduce virus levels in a patients blood to near zero.

But in some cases the drugs stop working - sometimes because virus has developed resistance to them - and the first sign of that would be a rise in a patient’s so-called “viral load”.

Virus levels can’t be detected by routine HIV tests, which can only show whether or not a person has the virus.",1
"After 12 weeks of daily yoga and coherent breathing, the subjects’ depressive symptoms significantly decreased and their levels of gamma-aminobutyric acid, a brain chemical that has calming and anti-anxiety effects, had increased. The research was presented in May at the International Congress on Integrative Medicine and Health in Las Vegas. While the study was small and lacked a control group, Dr. Streeter and her colleagues are planning a randomized controlled trial to further test the intervention.

“The findings were exciting,” she said. “They show that a behavioral intervention can have effects of similar magnitude as an antidepressant.”

Controlled breathing may also affect the immune system. Researchers at the Medical University of South Carolina divided a group of 20 healthy adults into two groups. One group was instructed to do two sets of 10-minute breathing exercises, while the other group was told to read a text of their choice for 20 minutes. The subjects’ saliva was tested at various intervals during the exercise. The researchers found that the breathing exercise group’s saliva had significantly lower levels of three cytokines that are associated with inflammation and stress. The findings were published in the journal BMC Complementary and Alternative Medicine in August.

Here are three basic breathing exercises to try on your own.

Coherent Breathing

If you have the time to learn only one technique, this is the one to try. In coherent breathing, the goal is to breathe at a rate of five breaths per minute, which generally translates into inhaling and exhaling to the count of six. If you have never practiced breathing exercises before, you may have to work up to this practice slowly, starting with inhaling and exhaling to the count of three and working your way up to six.",1
"For older people who fracture a hip, the prognosis is grim: a third or more die within a year and only about 1 in 5 return to their pre-injury level of function.

A new approach to care could mean it doesn’t have to be that way.

More hospitals are putting hip fracture patients on a fast track from the emergency room to the operating room, repairing the fracture in as little as six hours after diagnosis. The approach appears to produce significantly better outcomes for patients than the conventional practice of waiting up to three days before operating on the fracture. It can also reduce the costs of complications and longer hospital stays.

Fast-track hospitals also are providing follow-up care in special geriatric fracture clinics that steer patients through rehabilitation, provide treatment to strengthen bones and help them return to independent living.

An estimated 340,000 older adults suffer hip fractures in the U.S. annually, and many of them have other medical issues such as high blood pressure or heart disease. Doctors and surgeons have taken the position that fractures weren’t true emergencies, and studies suggested delaying surgery allows more time to evaluate patients and stabilize other conditions before giving them medical clearance for an operation.

But a review of more than 2 million patients led by researchers at NYU Langone Medical Center’s Department of Orthopaedic Surgery, and published last year in the Journal of Orthopaedic Trauma, found that compared with same-day surgery, each additional day of delay was associated with a significantly higher overall complication rate. And surgery two days and three or more days after admission was associated with higher rates of death.

The deaths are a combination of “complications related to the hip fracture and surgery, and overall decline in health that seems to be hastened after hip fracture,” says Dr. Joseph Zuckerman, study co-author and chair of Orthopaedic Surgery at NYU Langone.

“We have to start thinking differently, and treat a hip fracture with the same urgency as a heart attack or a stroke,” says Philip J. Devereaux, a cardiologist and researcher at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. He says delays can cause the physical trauma of a fracture to spark inflammatory responses in the body that increase stress on the heart and the immune system and increase risk for complications.

Dr. Devereaux, who also heads a surgical research group at McMaster’s Population Health Research Institute, is leading a large international trial, called Hip Attack, which will enroll up to 3,000 patients in 20 countries. The study will compare surgery within 6 hours for a hip fracture against standard care, typically surgery 24 hours after diagnosis. The aim is to determine the impact of accelerated surgery on death, heart attack, stroke, infection, and major bleeding. A pilot study in 2013, published in the Canadian Medical Association Journal, suggested patients receiving accelerated surgery had a 40% lower risk of major complications.

It took just one missed step for Martha Aldredge, 76, to fall and fracture her hip one evening last April while looking for a seat at her granddaughter’s high school concert near Greenville, S.C. Though bystanders helped her up and she managed to sit through the concert, she wasn’t able to walk when it was over. After being helped into a rolling chair, a friend drove her to the emergency room of the Bon Secours St. Francis Health System’s Eastside campus in Greenville.

An X-ray showed the hip was badly fractured, so she was transferred by ambulance to the St. Francis Hospital in downtown Greenville where orthopedic surgeon Michael O’Boyle oversees the Osteoporotic Fracture Program dedicated to the care of older patients with hip fractures.

In the OR the next day at 5 p.m., Dr. O’Boyle inserted a long y-shaped rod in the femur bone from her hip to her knee. Ms. Aldredge stayed on an orthopedic floor for three days before being transferred to a rehabilitation floor for four more days.

“They made me walk right away, which turned out to be a great thing,” Ms. Aldredge says. Dr. O’Boyle’s team told her about the importance of building up muscle and she started outpatient physical therapy a week later, going two days a week for three months. She was able to stop using a walker and, after a break from therapy, is continuing for several more sessions to build her stamina. She is back to driving herself, and says her bones are in good enough shape that she doesn’t anticipate future problems.

Dr. O’Boyle says it took a major cultural change to provide such care at St. Francis. In the past, he says, hip fracture patients were triaged as non-urgent cases in the ER, where they waited on average for eight hours, and then might wait nearly three more days for surgery, scheduled as a “waiting list” case. Patients were given heavy narcotics for pain, which contributed to a problem known as postoperative delirium for close to 80% of them, leading to longer hospital stays. There was little coordination of care among doctors, nurses and social workers to ensure good follow up care, and patients and families were often anxious due to poor communication. “We were not doing a good job, and the results were abysmal,” Dr. O’Boyle says.

The fracture clinic has helped improve results. The team coordinates care with emergency medical services to make sure patients don’t get too many narcotics and fluids before they arrive at the hospital. Time in the ER has been cut in half, and most cases are in surgery within 14 to 19 hours.

Since 2007, hospital stays have been reduced to less than four days from more than eight days. The delirium rate has been cut to 10%, and 75% of patients return to independent living. The mortality rate one-year postoperatively is less than 18%, according to Dr. O’Boyle. And patient and family satisfaction scores are at nearly 100%.

The clinic also coordinates care after discharge with rehabilitation programs, which it had not done in the past, to ensure patients follow its post-op instructions and are closely monitored during physical therapy sessions. Dr. Boyle’s team also evaluates and treats patients for osteoporosis and provides education on nutrition, falls prevention and exercise programs.

“We took an injury that was neglected and pushed off to the side with no sense of urgency and made it a priority, “Dr. O’Boyle says.

"And it could be the key to making millions of people healthier.

Writing in the journal Science Translational Medicine on Wednesday, scientists report that a protein produced by hookworms eases the symptoms of asthma in mice — and could one day be made into a pill to treat humans.

The study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites, one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom. It began years ago, when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist Alex Loukas, one of the senior authors on the new study. The doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease.

AD

“If you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies . . . where you remove the parasites [that's] where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies,” said Severine Navarro, the paper's lead author and a senior research fellow in Loukas's lab at James Cook University in Australia.

Many parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host's immune systems. When a hookworm crawls into a human, it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it. It limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn't leave its offspring scattered all over its host's gut. (Instead, it thoughtfully plants them in the host's poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body.) Like a very conscientious cat burglar, the hookworm knows it's best served by not making a mess.

“It's almost symbiotic,” Navarro said, “because in order for it to survive and thrive, it needs its host to be happy and healthy.”

AD

AD

Perhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems.

Thinking that they might be onto something, the researchers found 12 adults with celiac disease — a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten — who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy, slithery hookworm. It was important that the participants be adults, because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children, pregnant women and others. Navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm, no matter how debilitating their illness might be. Parasites are no joke.

For the dozen trial participants, the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten.

AD

AD

It was an intriguing result, but it's difficult to scale that kind of study. Only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science. And because of the risks associated with parasites, going around infecting people isn't a viable treatment option.

So Navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit — a compound called AIP-2 — and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days. The animals' asthma systems substantially declined, and their airways became measurably less inflamed. These benefits persisted for 10 weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment — “I don't even know how much that is in mouse years,” Navarro said.

The researchers also noticed that AIP-2 seemed to have a calming effect on the body's dendritic cells — a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats.

AD

AD

“It is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory T cells,” Navarro said, describing the cells that help modulate the immune system.

This suggests that AIP-2 might also help humans, since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice. Navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial, which would test the effectiveness of an AIP-2 pill.

Should that work, it has the potential to help the 235 million people around the world who suffer from asthma. The compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders, like celiac disease, inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis.

AD

This study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years. “There’s a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system,” Navarro said.

AD

She wouldn't go so far as to call parasites good. Deworming campaigns and other public health efforts unquestionably have protected countless people from anemia, malnutrition, developmental disorders and potentially deadly infections.

“But what we need is to find what's good in them,” she said, “and try to restore that missing component.”

"A new form of therapy has for the first time been shown to improve the symptoms and behaviour of autistic children, offering a potential breakthrough in care for millions of families.

Six years after parents were trained to better understand and interact with their preschool children, researchers found that the therapy had moderated the behaviour of those who had been severely autistic, unresponsive or unable to speak.

I’ve gone from refrigerator mother to super parent | Letters Read more

A child who might have run around a supermarket squealing, heedless of their parent, putting objects in their mouth and pushing past shoppers to try to press the buttons at checkout, might instead wait in the queue and even help load the trolley, the research found.

The success of the preschool autism communication trial (Pact) has surprised even the researchers who designed it. There are no drugs to treat the condition, which typically sets in around the age of two, and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists, with mixed results. Pact instead trained the parents to help their children.

Prof Jonathan Green at the University of Manchester, who led the study published in the Lancet medical journal, said they had not found the cure for autism, but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted.

Schoolgirls with autism share experiences in young adult novel Read more

“The advantage of this approach over a direct therapist-child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child,” he said. “Our findings are encouraging, as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change.

“This is not a cure, in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent, but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term.”

The trial involved 152 children aged two to four. The families visited a clinic twice a week for six months, where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys. Autistic children might not interact with their parents at all, but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request, the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond. If the child offered a toy, the parent reciprocated. If the child said a word, the parent repeated it and added something. The practice was repeated at home every day.

The therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity. At the end of the first year, the researchers could see the children had improved, but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow-up six years later. At the start of the trial, 50% of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and 55% of those who did were assessed as severely autistic. The children in the intervention group, though, got better. The proportion assessed as severe in the control group was 63% by the end of six years, compared with 46% in the intervention group.

Other experts applauded the work. “I can see why these researchers are excited,” said Dorothy Bishop, professor of developmental neuropsychology at the University of Oxford. “These results at follow-up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures. My impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms, rather than curing autism. Nevertheless, for parents of children with autism, even a modest reduction would be worthwhile.”

Dr Max Davie, of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said it offered “a hugely cheering message for families”, while Uta Frith, emeritus professor of cognitive development at University College London, called it “a remarkably positive story, because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive”.

The absence of any hope, as well as the very sudden regression in children’s behaviour, led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of Andrew Wakefield that the MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccine was the cause of autism.

“Parents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare, with little information or tailored support available to them,” said Dr James Cusack, director of science at the charity Autistica. “Too often, parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families. These results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science.”

The researchers said children’s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years. The parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children, in social communication and in repetitive behaviours. But there was no change in child anxiety, challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up.

About 1% of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder, which ranges from mild to severe. The lifetime costs to the UK, which include health, social care and education costs as well as productivity losses, are estimated at £1m to £1.5m per child and between $1.4m and $2.4m in the United States.",1
"Your cells might be aging faster than you are, and new tests purport to help you find out.

A few companies are offering mail-order testing to measure the length of people’s telomeres, the protective caps of DNA on the ends of chromosomes that have been likened to the plastic tips that prevent shoelaces from fraying. Telomeres gradually shorten as people age and eventually may disappear, leaving cells vulnerable to disease and death.

Telomere Diagnostics, of Menlo Park, Calif., launched an $89 test last week. Users mail in a drop of blood and get back a calculation of their age in “TeloYears,” adjusted up or down depending on how they compare with the general population. The service also provides advice for improving diet, fitness, sleep and stress levels, which some small studies suggest may help telomeres regain length.

“There’s a difference between knowing how old you are, and how well you are aging,” says Telomere Diagnostics chief executive Jason Shelton. “The age you are on the inside, on the cellular level, may be a better indicator.”

Still, some top telomere scientists say such information amounts to little more than high-tech palm reading, in part because telomere length varies so widely in the general population that it isn’t clear what length is problematic.

“We don’t yet know how to interpret these results. It might suggest there is something wrong when there isn’t,” says Carol Greider, director of molecular biology and genetics at Johns Hopkins Medicine, who shared the 2009 Nobel Prize for Medicine for discovering how telomeres protect chromosomes.

What Your Cells Can Tell You What are telomeres?

Telomeres are stretches of DNA at the end of chromosomes that protect them from damage, but they gradually wear away each time cells divide. When telomeres become critically short, chromosomes can fuse together and malfunction, causing cells to die, which contributes to disease.

How do telomeres relate to aging?

Many studies have linked diseases of aging with short telomeres, but it isn’t clear whether short telomeres are a sign of cellular age or help cause the process.

Can this process be slowed?

Telomere shortening is determined by heredity, environment and lifestyle choices. Some studies suggest that controlling inflammation, exercising, maintaining a healthy diet and weight and not smoking, can slow the rate of shortening. An enzyme called telomerase adds more length to telomeres, but it is mostly found in sperm, egg and stem cells and cancerous tumors. There is no evidence that telomerase supplements help.

Can measuring my telomeres tell me how long I have to live?

No. Most people never reach the end of their telomeres, and some scientists say they have to be extremely short before they contribute to disease.

Fellow Nobel winner Elizabeth Blackburn, now president of the Salk Institute, co-founded the predecessor company to Telomere Diagnostics, but parted ways with it in 2013 and is no longer connected to the company. Dr. Blackburn declined to comment for this article.

Since telomeres were discovered in the 1990s, hundreds of studies have suggested links between telomere length and heart disease, diabetes, cancer, Alzheimer’s disease and mental-health issues.

A meta-analysis of 24 studies involving a total of 43,725 participants, including 8,400 with cardiovascular diseases, found that those in the bottom third of telomere length had a 50% greater risk of cardiovascular disease than those in the top third. The review was published in BMJ in 2014.

While telomere length is largely influenced by genetics, environment and lifestyle choices can affect it, too. Studies suggest shorter telomeres are associated with lack of exercise, poor sleep and a diet high in refined carbohydrates, among other factors.

NASA believes that lengthy space travel can also age people faster and is monitoring how the telomeres of astronauts and twin brothers Scott and Mark Kelly change over time. Scott spent nearly a year in space, orbiting Earth in the Space Station, about four times as long as Mark.

Few studies have looked at whether people can lengthen their telomeres by adopting healthy choices. An often cited clinical trial, published in the Lancet in 2013, followed 35 men with low-risk prostate cancer for five years. It found that the 10 men who followed a program of diet, activity, stress management and social support lengthened their telomeres by about 10% compared with the 25 who didn’t. The study was conducted by researchers at University of California, San Francisco, and the nonprofit Preventive Medicine Research Institute.

Critics say the few controlled trials that show people can lengthen their telomeres are very small and the large observational studies that make up the bulk of the scientific literature on telomeres don’t demonstrate cause and effect. And while exercise, a healthy diet and stress reduction may lower the risk of death and disease, it hasn’t been shown that telomere length has anything to do with it, some researchers say.

Much of what is known about telomeres and disease comes from studying people who have inherited extremely short telomeres and are vulnerable to several specific conditions, including pulmonary fibrosis, immune deficiency, loss of bone marrow and certain cancers. It is important for those people, who make up at most 10% of the population, to know if their telomeres are abnormally short because they should avoid certain treatments, says Mary Armanios, clinical director of the Telomere Center at Johns Hopkins.

“For everyone else, based on what we know in 2016, telomere length is not relevant to disease risk,” Dr. Armanios says. “They have to be really, really short to cause disease and most people never get to that point as they age.”

The testing companies argue that the wealth of observational studies provides ample evidence that short telomeres are a risk factor for many diseases in the general population and that making healthy lifestyle changes can help telomeres regain length. Knowing your telomere length isn’t meant to diagnose a specific disease, they say. “It’s more like a check-engine light” on a car, an early indication that something is amiss, says Calvin Harley, chief scientific officer at Telomere Diagnostics, which recommends users take the test every six months to track their progress.

Other testing companies also contend that shorter-than-average telomeres can be a warning sign of future health problems. Titanovo Inc., in Raleigh, N.C., uses cheek swabs for its $150 test. Life Length, based in Madrid, offers its test only through physicians, who it says can help patients understand what they are most at risk for. The test, which costs $395, measures all 92 telomeres in cell samples, rather than reporting averages, as Telomere Diagnostics does.

Stephen Matlin, Life Length’s chief executive, says tens of thousands of patients in the U.S., the U.K. and the Middle East have used the test. While it isn’t known if they have lengthened their telomeres, “we do see that people adopt major lifestyle changes to improve their health and fitness,” he says.

"The genetic legacy each of us inherits is a powerful force -- and in a few extreme cases, it can be deadly. Still, thanks to science, genetics need not always be destiny, as Martha Teichner shows us in our Cover Story:

Amy and Brad Price’s home in Omaha, Nebraska, is crazy with all the kids around. There are seven of them, ages 2 to 11. But if you look closely, you’ll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5½ of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene.

“She was happy all the time,” Brad said.

Amy added, “She loved pretty dresses.”

“She loved her tutu,” Brad said.

She was talkative, addicted to “Caillou,” the animated TV series, a lively little girl, ‘til she was two. “Her knees were going a little knock-kneed,” Amy said. “And she had been just randomly falling down.”

Her doctor said, “Nothing to worry about,” but she quickly got worse.

“I was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,” Amy recalled. “And I turned around and said, ‘Liviana, what’s wrong?’ And she said, ‘Mommy, my legs don’t work.’”

Liviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: “She’s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they’re telling me she’s gonna die.”

Many children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn’t been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too.

“I get a call from the doctor’s office,” said Amy, “I knew. And I was thinking, ‘I’ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.’”

Except that’s not what happened.

Doing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni’s life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms.

The Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan.

“The patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,” said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial.

A patient’s stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient’s body.

Here’s what’s really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can’t get AIDS.

Why the HIV virus? “Is it particularly efficient at getting around the body?” Teichner asked.

“Yeah, it’s very efficient in entering our cells, and that’s why we use it,” Dr. Biffi replied.

How well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. “At least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,” Dr. Biffi said. “Some of the children were going to school and having a normal life.”

Giovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored.

Brad Price calls Dr. Biffi “Our angel. She took us in like family.”

So why Italy, and not the United States?

Gene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it’s back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children’s Cancer and Blood Disorders Center.

Teichner asked, “Do you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?”

“I think yes, absolutely,” Dr. Biffi replied.

The MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what’s possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases.

Trials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it.

Compare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that’s about all. She was diagnosed at 2.

For her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. “It’s decline in slow motion, and that’s difficult,” said Carr.

“I remember the social worker said, ‘It’s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,’” Kefalis said.

After more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter’s life meaning.

“We’re not wealthy people,” she said. “We didn’t know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars. And so we said, ‘Well, we’ll start selling cupcakes.’”

The Calliope Joy Foundation was formed in 2013. It’s been slow going, but the money added up. And when Kefalis learned about the Italian trial, and the fact that Amy Price had to keep going back to Milan with Giovanni and Ceci, it was clear she would use the money to help families get to Italy.

“She sent me a picture of Giovanni playing in his front yard,” Kefalis said. “He’s three months younger than Cal, so he should’ve been as sick as Cal. He should have been on a feeding tube. He should be paralyzed. And I thought, I gotta be a part of this. I need to help this happen again and again and again.”

Maria Kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war -- her war against MLD. She’s raised more than $250,000, and helped where she could, but she’s hit a wall. So far, not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the FDA. The trial in Italy is closed to new patients. It could be years before any children with MLD will be allowed to receive the treatment in the United States.

“Now, it’s just impatience,” Kefalis said. “Now it’s, like, ‘When do we get this here? What will it take. Tell me what you need me to do.’”

Until then, she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time -- the Price children, Giovanni and Cecilia, proof to her the war can be won.

Teichner asked Brad and Amy Price, “You keep using the word ‘miracle.’ In what way is all of this a miracle?”

“Our son’s still with us, and Cecilia as well,” they replied. “That’s the miracle.”

"Even if you’re not a big fan of seafood, you probably know that adding more fish to your diet can do a lot of good, from improving your heart health to lowering inflammation. Now, according to scientists at the University of Colorado, there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant.

The study, presented at the American Society of Reproductive Medicine annual meeting, was in mice, so more research needs to be completed before omega 3 foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility. But Dr. Malgorzata Skaznik-Wikiel, an obstetrician-gynecologist who led the study, is encouraged. She worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega 3 fatty acids. These mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega 3 fats, so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries.

What she found: The mice with the higher levels of omega 3 fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat, meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs-to-be. These could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth. When the ovaries were examined even further, Skaznik-Wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega 3s. Higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup.

“Based on this study, it looks very encouraging that omega 3s can potentially improve fertility,” says Skaznik-Wikiel. “Our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega 3s to improve fertility.”

Exactly how the healthy omega 3 fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn’t clear yet. But other studies Skaznik-Wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function.

More studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega 3 fatty acids might play in fertility, but for now, Skaznik-Wikiel says that there isn’t much harm in consuming more omega 3 fats. (Some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega 3s, but those cases are relatively rare.)

There may also be other benefits linked to omega 3 fatty acids for the fetus as well, in helping nerve development — that’s why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega 3 fats. “We hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes, omega 3 fatty acids are the way to go [for women hoping to get pregnant,]” she says. “But even without that firm answer at this point I don’t see the harm in supplementing.”

"Story highlights Anti-cytokine drugs may treat depression in the future, researchers say

They are commonly prescribed to treat autoimmune diseases, such as rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis

(CNN) In the future, a new class of anti-inflammatory drugs could be used to treat depression, say University of Cambridge researchers.

Drugs such as aspirin and ibuprofen treat inflammation, the body's immune response to infections or pathogens. During an inflammatory response, immune cells flood the bloodstream with proteins known as cytokines.

Drugs to counteract these cytokines are the newest generation of anti-inflammatories. Some are so new, clinical trials are still testing their efficacy and safety for human use.

Based on previous findings about depression, the team looked at the side effects experienced by patients given anti-cytokine drugs in 20 separate studies. All the participants had chronic autoimmune inflammatory diseases, which occur when healthy cells are mistaken for infected cells, causing the immune system to attack the body and leading to inflammation.

"Brain Implant Restores Sense Of Touch To Paralyzed Man

Enlarge this image toggle caption UPMC/Pitt Health Sciences UPMC/Pitt Health Sciences

Twelve years ago, a car wreck took away Nathan Copeland's ability to control his hands or sense what his fingers were touching.

A few months ago, researchers at the University of Pittsburgh and the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center gave Copeland a new way to reach out and feel the world around him. It's a mind-controlled robotic arm that has pressure sensors in each fingertip that send signals directly to Copeland's brain.

The scientists published details of their work online Thursday in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

""It's a really weird sensation,"" Copeland, now 30, says in a video made shortly after he first tried the system. ""Sometimes it feels, kind of, like electrical and sometimes it's more of a pressure."" But he also describes many of the sensations coming from his robotic hand as ""natural.""

When Copeland touches an object with the robotic hand, he can tell which finger the sensation is coming from and whether an object feels hard or soft, says Robert Gaunt, a bioengineer and assistant professor in the Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation at the University of Pittsburgh.

""But we're really not at the point where we could, say, get him to feel the difference between silk and burlap,"" Gaunt says.

The success represents an advance that is ""absolutely critical in terms of making prosthetics useful,"" says Mike McLoughlin, an engineer at the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory.

McLoughlin is part of a team at Hopkins that developed the Modular Prosthetic Limb that Copeland is using. The research at both Hopkins and in Pittsburgh is supported by the government's Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.

For several years now, people have been able to control robotic arms using thoughts alone. But they have relied entirely on vision to know whether the arm is going in the right direction or grasping an object with the proper amount of force.

That makes it very challenging to perform simple tasks like grasping a foam coffee cup without crushing it, McLoughlin says.

Sensing Touch Watch a blindfolded Nathan Copeland accurately sense which finger's being touched.

""Without sensory feedback, somebody would have to actually have to look at the prosthetic, look at the cup, start to close the hand, (and) visually see the cup is starting to deform,"" he says.

Restoring Copeland's sense of touch was a painstaking process, but the Pittsburgh team knew it was possible.

""His hand has been disconnected from his brain because of his spinal cord injury,"" Gaunt says. ""But the brain hasn't lost its ability to feel.""

So the team began looking for a way to send touch sensations directly to Copeland's brain. The first step was to monitor his brain activity using a technique called magnetoencephalography.

""We were able to see the parts of his brain that became active when he was watching videos of a hand being touched,"" Gaunt says.

Next, the researchers placed tiny electrodes in Copeland's brain that could stimulate the areas corresponding to each finger. Then they waited for the brain to heal, as it adjusted to the presence of the electrodes.

It was several weeks before the team was able to send the first tiny pulse of electricity to Copeland's brain. ""When it finally happened, he just very calmly said, 'Yep, I felt it on my index finger,' "" Gaunt recalls. ""But in the background I was breathing a sigh of relief and other people were cheering.""

Of course, mind-controlled robots are still years away from consumer applications, McLoughlin says. At the moment, they are still too expensive, too bulky and too finicky to be used outside a laboratory setting. And there's no good way to control them without implanting electrodes in the brain.

Still, the ability to receive touch sensation from a robotic arm has the potential to help not only thousands of people who are paralyzed, but also people with a wide range of physical disabilities, McLoughlin says. For example, robots that provide sensory feedback could eventually help a disabled person cook a meal or clean up things at home.

""We're on the verge of something here that's going to transform lives,"" he says.",1

HealthDay Reporter

FRIDAY, Oct. 14, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- A multiple sclerosis drug usually reserved for people in the late stages of the disease seems to offer long-term remission in newly diagnosed patients, researchers report.

Because of serious side effects, the drug -- Lemtrada (alemtuzumab) -- is approved in the United States only for patients who have failed other treatments. But the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease-related disability.

""The expectation in MS has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease. Now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability,"" said lead researcher Dr. Gavin Giovannoni. He is a neurology professor at Queen Mary University of London in England.

The treatment is not without its downsides, however. Because of the potential for side effects, people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose, Giovannoni said.

Giovannoni described Lemtrada as an immune system ""rebooter."" First, it depletes the immune system, then it allows it to recover, he explained.

During the time when the immune system is depleted, there is a risk of infection over eight to 12 weeks, including herpes infections, he said.

Also, when the immune system rebuilds itself, ""a significant number of people, about 40 percent, will develop another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said. These include Graves' disease (a thyroid disorder) and a bleeding/bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP), which occurs in about 2 percent of patients, he noted.

""But these diseases can be treated, so it's not like MS. It's kind of trading in your MS for another autoimmune disease,"" Giovannoni said.

Still, one MS specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug.

Lemtrada is not for every patient with MS and the decision to use it should be carefully considered, said Dr. Dhanashri Miskin, an attending neurologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""Although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient, risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease,"" Miskin said.

The decision to start Lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks, including infusion-associated reactions, infections, and autoimmune adverse events, she said. ""Although alemtuzumab [Lemtrada] treatment is associated with safety risks, those risks are manageable in most patients,"" Miskin said.

The new trial of more than 600 patients with relapsing-remitting MS was funded by Sanofi Genzyme and Bayer HealthCare Pharmaceuticals, the drug's makers.

MS occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord. People can suffer muscle weakness, numbness, vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination. Relapsing-remitting MS is the most common type, with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission.

For this study, Giovannoni and colleagues treated 628 patients with relapsing-remitting MS who had not responded to at least one other MS drug. Lemtrada was given to 426 patients, while 202 received another drug, interferon beta-1a.

The researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years. By the study's end, nearly 28 percent of those given Lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a 10-point disability test, versus about 15 percent of those receiving interferon, the researchers found.

Moreover, patients receiving Lemtrada were 2.5 times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon. And they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness, the findings showed.

The findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren't led by those recovering from relapses.

Giovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from MS symptoms. Not only does alemtuzumab improve disability, but most patients go into long-term remission of at least five to eight years, he said.

""Some patients have been going 12 years without any evidence of disease activity,"" he said.

According to Bruce Bebo, executive vice president for research at the National Multiple Sclerosis Society, ""Restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with MS.""

This study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab, he said. ""I am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment,"" Bebo said.

Giovannoni pointed out that most of the drug's benefits are obtained early in the disease. ""If you really want this drug to have a big impact, you should use it as early as possible. In the European Union, it's recommended for early use,"" he noted.

The report was published online Oct. 12 in the journal Neurology.

"The race to create the next potent ovarian cancer drug is coming to a head.

Ovarian cancer has historically been one of the harder cancers to treat — but a promising new class of drugs, called PARP inhibitors, is proving powerful in delaying the growth of tumors by preventing cancer cells from repairing themselves after they’ve been damaged by chemotherapy.

In recent days, the researchers behind three PARP drug contenders threw down preliminary data during the European Society for Medical Oncology conference in Denmark.

advertisement

Massachusetts-based Tesaro was the clear front-runner with its experimental once-a-day ovarian cancer pill, niraparib. Its results built upon exciting data it released in June — showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman’s cancer doesn’t get worse. (The study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer, just how long it stopped tumors from growing.)

A small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib, which is now owned by Pfizer (PFE), recently showed similarly compelling results.

But Colorado’s Clovis Oncology (CLVS) fared less well. Though its own PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone, its data didn’t measure up to the other two trials. The company’s stock plunged 18 percent on Friday after the data were released.

One PARP inhibitor has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration: olaparib, sold by AstraZeneca (AZN) as Lynparza. It’s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy.

Chemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors — but often, the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves. PARP inhibitors work by stopping this repair. They’re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the BRCA mutation, since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged DNA.

While chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack, PARP inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs. The hope is that they’ll keep cancer at bay once it’s been attacked by chemo.

A number of cancers are associated with BRCA mutations — including breast, prostate, and pancreatic.

More and more clinical trials will spring up to test PARP inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments, such as immunotherapy, said Dr. Christina Annunziata, an investigator at the National Cancer Institute who studied the efficacy of Lynparza in ovarian cancer patients.

The field is so hot that over the summer, Pfizer agreed to spend an eye-popping $14 billion to buy San Francisco-based biotech Medivation. The key asset Pfizer wanted? The PARP inhibitor talazoparib. So far, there’s just extremely early data, but it looks promising. In a pilot study of 13 breast cancer patients on the drug at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, tumors shrank on average 78 percent.

“We found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy,” said Dr. Jennifer Litton, the lead investigator. She’s launching a larger trial for further study.

As for Tesaro, it first shared initial data from a Phase 3 clinical trial this past June. It showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra 15 months without their disease getting worse, compared to a control group. At the European conference this weekend, Tesaro added a few more details to that data:

The study looked at 553 patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy, known as platinum chemo. The best results came from patients with the BRCA mutation: Their tumors didn’t start to grow again for 21 months, on average, compared to 5.5 months for a control group that just received a placebo. Other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups.

The results were published this weekend in the New England Journal of Medicine.

A few weeks ago, the Food and Drug Administration granted Tesaro’s drug fast-track approval status — and this new data will support its registration applications to both the FDA and the European Medicines Agency, Tesaro CEO Lonnie Moulder said. The company is now planning trials in lung cancer, and is considering other cancers to pursue.

“In the field, these would be described as landmark results,” Moulder said. “At this time, there’s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer.”

By comparison, Clovis Oncology has floundered.

The company aims to use its PARP inhibitor, rucaparib, to treat only patients with BRCA mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies. But the data it presented at the European conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than Lynparza, the PARP inhibitor that’s been marketed by AstraZeneca since 2014.

The study’s lead investigator, Rebecca Kristeleit, defended the performance of rucaparib, adding that one can’t compare Clovis’s drug to Tesaro’s: “It’s a completely different population, and a different use of the drugs,” she said.

Because early symptoms are fairly benign — bloating and back pain — about 75 percent of women diagnosed with ovarian cancer don’t learn they have it until it has progressed to stage 3. About 22,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, and about 15,000 women die of the disease each year in the United States.",1
"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy.

As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker.

And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone.

Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment.

“Remember this day. It’s a new day for lung cancer treatment,” Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne’s University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented.

An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become “a new standard of care”.

The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected.

Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1.

Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy.

Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany’s Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard “from today”.

U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24.

Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO.

COMBINATION THERAPY

The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study.

Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors’ expectations, up until now, have been quite low.

In the event, researchers reported that Merck’s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent.

Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response.

Roger Perlmutter, Merck’s head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old.

Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body’s natural killer cells to home in on tumors.

They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market.

Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen.

The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data.

Results of Bristol’s failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO.

These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months.

The failure of Opdivo to work for “all comers” in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company’s market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments.

Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.",1
Botox Works As Well As Nerve Stimulator for Incontinence – Study,1
"Actress Marisa Tomei is one of among an estimated 5 million Americans who suffers from chronic dry eye (CDE), a condition that can cause symptoms such as itchiness, stinging, difficulty making tears and blurred vision. To raise awareness about CDE and help other people find relief, the “My Cousin Vinny” and “The Wrestler” star has teamed up with pharmaceutical company Allergan and Guide Dogs for the Blind, an organization that trains dogs and pairs them with visually impaired individuals.

After toting around eye drops, Tomei said she has found a solution with Allergan’s prescription drug RESTASIS®, which works by increasing the eyes’ natural ability to produce tears. CDE causes inflammation that can prevent tear production, according to Allergan.

Sometimes, individuals with CDE have trouble opening their eyes, but Tomei said she went to the doctor and reported mild but incessant itchiness and dryness, and was diagnosed with CDE.

She turned to RESTASIS® because she didn’t want to keep worrying about constantly using eye drops.

“It was as simple as going to the doctor, getting a prescription and trying RESTASIS®,” Tomei, 51, who stars in the upcoming “Spider-Man: Homecoming” movie, told FoxNews.com.

She decided to partner with Allergan not only because she found the prescription improved her quality of life but also because of the company’s relationship with Guide Dogs for the Blind. On Restasis.com, you can take the brand’s “dry eye quiz”— for every quiz taken, Allergan has agreed to donate $1 to the organization. When you visit the website, you’ll see a pop-up window with a portal to take the quiz.

Tomei, a self-proclaimed animal lover, expressed that the effort is close to her heart.

“A whole world of freedom opens up [for these individuals] because you can move about a city like this (New York City) or anywhere much more easily, and the dogs can become your eyes,” she said.

The quiz on Restasis.com can help individuals learn whether they’re a candidate for the drug. If you think you may be suffering from CDE, Tomei advised visiting your doctor to receive a diagnosis.

"The disease is characterized by an itching, oozing rash that can cover almost all of the skin. The constant itch, to say nothing of the disfigurement, can be so unbearable that many patients consider suicide. There has never been a safe and effective treatment.

On Saturday, the results of two large clinical trials of a new drug offered hope to the estimated 1.6 million adult Americans with an uncontrolled, moderate-to-severe form of the disease, atopic dermatitis, which is a type of eczema.

Most patients who got the active drug, dupilumab, instead of a placebo reported that the itching began to wane within two weeks and was gone in a few months, as their skin began to clear. Nearly 40 percent of participants getting the drug saw all or almost all of their rash disappear.

For some, relief was almost instantaneous.

“I knew immediately I was on the drug” and not the placebo, said Daniela Velasco, an event planner in Playa del Carmen, Mexico. Within a couple of weeks, the ugly red rash that had covered 90 percent of her body was almost gone. Even better, she said, “for the first time I didn’t feel any itch at all.”",1
"Master said each participant was asked to carry an accelerometer to record movements and an iPod Touch loaded with an app that would ping them prompts at intervals during each day to report any symptoms they were feeling. They also completed activity questionnaires and summaries. In addition, they wore a device called an ActiGraph to monitor sleep.",1
"The window for helping certain stroke patients with a potentially life-saving blood clot removal surgical treatment may be longer than previously thought, according to a study published today in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Traditionally stroke is treated with medications that stabilize or diminish blood clots in the brain. In select patients surgical intervention to remove the clot may be possible to mitigate effects of the stroke.

Currently, the American Stroke Association advises that blood clot removal for some patients -- an emergency procedure called endovascular thrombectomy recently developed and increasingly used in addition to medical therapies -- should be done within six hours after stroke symptoms to lower the amount of disability patients will face later. But this analysis showed that the time for treatment could be slightly longer -- up to 7.3 hours.

This study could affect the current guidelines on treating stroke patients, according to Dr. Cathy Sila, Director of the Comprehensive Stroke Center at University Hospitals Cleveland Medical Center. She said there is ""compelling rationale to move that window a little bit.""

As a result of having lost blood flow to the brain for an extended time, stroke victims often suffer physical disabilities and lose varying degrees of their independence. They often require longer-term care and therapies.

""Long-term disability of stroke is more expensive than cost of hospitalization,"" Sila told ABC News today.

Authors from multiple institutions including the University of Calgary, pooled data from five studies on stroke treatments to see if providing endovascular thrombectomy in addition to standard medical treatment past six hours would help patients. They analyzed those studies for patients who have had large blood vessel strokes, seeking to understand how much of an effect blood clot removal surgery performed after six hours would have on their longer-term recovery. They used a benchmark of three months after the stroke to assess patients' level of disability.

In total, 1,287 patients were enrolled in the five trials studied. The researchers examined clinical data and brain imaging in addition to the patients’ physical function. They found that the patients who received standard medical therapy along with an endovascular thrombectomy up to 7.3 hours after developing stroke symptoms were less likely than patients who were treated with only medications to report disability three months later.

When they examined the patients three months after the stroke, each hour delay in receiving the treatment corresponded in worse outcomes for the patients, including more severe disability and less functional independence.

This meant that even the patients who received the treatment outside of the generally accepted 6 hours cut off up to the 7.3 hours point tended to report less disability during their recovery. However, if people received the treatment after 7.3 hours from onset of symptoms there was no statistical improvement.

Dr. Mayank Goyal, a co-author of the study and professor of Radiology, University of Calgary, said he hopes the study will help raise awareness about the importance of getting prompt treatment for a stroke and having an efficient system to provide this procedure.

""Time is brain,"" Goyal told ABC News. ""The faster we can re-establish blood flow to brain, the higher the likelihood of the patients having a good outcome and going back to independent living.""

Sila said further study is needed to find out if these kinds of procedures could benefit people even after the 7.3 hours from symptom onset. She pointed out that these studies are important since they can help change guidelines and push insurance companies to cover the procedure for more patients.

""We need to have this kind of data so third party payers would have it to base [costs] on,"" she said.

"Artist Lorie Novak in front of work from her Migraine Register project, which documents all the time she's lost to debilitating migraines.

It often starts with the aura.

Zig-zagging lines come into view, everyday light becomes searingly bright, and vision starts to slip. These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way.

“It’s like you’re possessed,” said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. “I almost feel separate from my body, like it’s just this painful shell around me that’s not me.”

advertisement

Novak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s.

But that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales.

The new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven’t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they’re sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away.

And thus four drug makers — Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals — have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks.

So far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they’re afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It’s by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co.

Each treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade.

So far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share.

“There will certainly be hypercompetition,” said William Ratner, Lilly’s senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies’ fortunes are intertwined, he said, and “the class only wins if headache care in America improves.”

Aiming to prevent migraines before they start

There’s plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed “Sleepomax” by doctors and patients because it’s also a heavy sedative.

“I’m very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,” said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

Targeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein’s scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future.

With the “exquisite sensitivity” of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said.

Because antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck’s failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.)

“So in some senses, it’s a paradigm shift,” Schatzman said.

But there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be “the Holy Grail of personalized medicine,” said Rob Lenz, Amgen’s global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet.

And long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they’ve only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said.

‘I felt like my life was being stolen from me’

Any advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment.

Bates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn’t respond to any of the preventative therapies available.

“The pain is more than anything I’ve ever experienced, and I’ve run on broken legs before,” she said. “I felt like my life was being stolen from me.”

Collectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation.

Yet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said.

It’s a “subjective symptom that predominantly affects women,” said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. “That’s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it.”

Novak, a professor of photography at New York University’s Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that’s more than 120 pictures.

The idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years.

“That for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,” Novak said, “of how much time I lose.”",1
"Cancer cells remain elusive and tough to locate, but a new crop of nuclear-imaging tests promises to lead to more accurate prognosis and treatment.

The tests use imaging agents that combine radioactive isotopes with targeted molecules that can spot cancer at the cellular level. The ability to accurately locate the cancers helps physicians make better and earlier diagnoses—and may eventually make possible targeted nuclear-medicine therapies that identify and kill cancer cells, but not the surrounding healthy cells.

This summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved two such tests—one can trace slow-growing prostate cancer cells, while the other targets a rare condition where neuroendocrine cells develop into tumors. Advanced Accelerator Applications, a French pharmaceutical company that developed the test for neuroendocrine tumors, also is seeking approval for a drug called Lutathera that uses the same technique to zero in on the cancer that needs treating, says Chief Executive Stefano Buono.

Finding the fuel

Developed in the 1970s, nuclear imaging is used to reveal the body’s metabolic activities (in contrast with static imaging, such as X-rays, which provide just a snapshot). Positron emission tomography, or PET, scans can be used to identify many common cancers, as well as Alzheimer’s and epilepsy.

But many PET scans aren’t effective at locating certain cancers, including cancer of the prostate, the third most common type of cancer in the U.S., with more than 180,000 new cases and more than 26,000 deaths expected this year. That’s because the most common imaging agent, known as FDG, uses glucose to locate cancer cells. Prostate and several other cancers don’t use as much glucose, so the scans aren’t effective for those diseases.

The new tests pair radioactive materials with a receptor that reacts to a hormone for neuroendocrine tumors or, in the case of prostate cancer, amino acid, which is what fuels the disease. The result is a better view of the cancer.

Spotting a relapse

Blue Earth Diagnostics Ltd., based in Oxford, England, developed the prostate imaging agent, called Axumin, based on a molecule originally developed by Mark Goodman, a professor of radiology and imaging sciences at Emory University’s School of Medicine in the mid-1990s. The agent was administered commercially for the first time in September at a hospital in Atlanta.

With recurrent prostate cancer, the test’s ability to locate cancer at the cellular level means that it can complement current diagnostic tests.

Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is the common way to screen for the disease. But it isn’t entirely reliable because the PSA protein count also rises with age and disease of the prostate like inflammation, and it doesn’t help to determine the location of the tumor. That can be crucial in deciding on treatment. If the cancer is confined to the pelvis, surgery or radiation can be used to treat the disease. But if it has spread to lymph nodes or the bones, hormone therapy may be required.

The test also allows for earlier detection of recurrent disease. An estimated 20% to 30% of men who are treated for prostate cancer will relapse after five years, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

“The new scan can detect cancer with a relatively low PSA count, say, under 5, when the cancer may still be curable,” says Mark Scholz, founder and executive director of the non-profit Prostate Cancer Research Institute. “That changes everything.”

There are other efforts seeking to screen for cancer on a cellular level. Genetic testing, for example, looks for inherited mutations in a person’s genes to gauge the risk of developing hereditary cancer, and allow patients to be on guard even before any symptoms appear. Still, nuclear imaging can provide complementary information to these newer methods. For one, nuclear imaging can see how the tumor behaves in the body and its immediate environment and can be used to inform physicians about changes in the disease during the course of treatment, says Dr. Janet Eary, a deputy associate director at the National Cancer Institute’s cancer-imaging program.

"When babies eat certain foods early in life—the kinds so many end up allergic to, like eggs and peanuts—they’re less likely to develop allergies to those foods later on, finds a new analysis published in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

This is relatively new thinking. Not so long ago, in 2000, the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that allergenic foods be kept away from infants until they were at least a year old, and often older. That warning was especially strong for those with a family history of allergies. But, as an editorial published in the same issue of JAMA points out, in the next decade, food allergy prevalence nearly doubled in the United States.

That advice has been amended, and newer evidence has shown that introducing foods earlier is actually better for preventing food allergies. The authors of the just-published study reviewed all of the available evidence on the topic and included 146 studies in their final analysis.

They found evidence of “moderate certainty” that introducing peanuts early, between ages 4 and 11 months, is linked to a reduction in the risk of developing a peanut allergy. Eggs, too, showed this association when they were introduced between ages 4 and 6 months. Early introduction of another common allergen, fish, was also linked to less allergy—possibly due to the anti-inflammatory effects of omega-3s—though evidence for this link wasn’t as certain.

Early introduction didn’t seem to make a difference for autoimmune diseases, at least according to the available evidence; eating gluten young wasn’t associated with the risk of developing celiac disease.

Exactly why is a question researchers are still exploring. “It is not clear that it is the specific early introduction of an allergenic food that renders immunological protection, rather than the accompanying increased diversity in the diet that occurs as a by-product,” writes Dr. Matthew Greenhawt, an allergy and immunology specialist at Children’s Hospital Colorado, in the accompanying editorial. More research is necessary to figure out the ideal amounts of these allergens, the optimum times of introduction and the reasons behind the link.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Exposure to bright light can raise testosterone levels and lead to greater sexual satisfaction in men with low sexual desire, according to the results of a small scientific trial.

Scientists at the University of Siena in Italy found that regular, early-morning use of a light box – similar to those used to combat Seasonal Affective Disorder or SAD - helped men increase testosterone and improved their sex lives.

Andrea Fagiolini, a professor who led the study and presented it at the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology conference in Vienna on Monday, said the treatment may prove useful during the Northern hemisphere’s darker winter months.

“The increased levels of testosterone explain the greater reported sexual satisfaction,” he said. “In the Northern hemisphere, the body’s testosterone production naturally declines from November through April, and then rises steadily through the spring and summer with a peak in October.”

Low sexual desire can affect significant numbers of men after the age of 40, with studies finding that up to 25 percent of men report problems.

Fagiolini’s team recruited 38 men diagnosed with either hypoactive sexual desire disorder or sexual arousal disorder – both characterized by a lack of interest in sex.

After taking baseline readings, they divided the men into two groups and gave one regular treatment with a bright light box, while the control, or placebo, group was treated with a light box adapted to give out significantly less light.

“We found fairly significant differences,” Fagiolini said.

“Before treatment, both groups averaged a sexual satisfaction score of around 2 out of 10. But after treatment, the group exposed to the bright light was scoring sexual satisfaction scores of around 6.3. In contrast, the control group only showed an average score of around 2.7 after treatment.”",1
"An inhaler that protects the lungs against air pollution has been developed by scientists and could help the many millions of people affected by toxic air to avoid its worst effects.

The inhaler delivers a molecule, first found in bacteria in the Egyptian desert, which stabilises water on the surface of the lung cells to form a protective layer. It is expected to be available as an inexpensive, over-the-counter product.

Outdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over 3 million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes. But research is also uncovering new impacts on health, including degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer’s, mental illness and, this week, diabetes.

The impact of air pollution costs $5tn a year, according to a World Bank report published last week. In the UK, at least 40,000 people a year die prematurely from air pollution, with a cross-party committee of MPs calling it a “public health emergency”.

But the government’s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week, just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern England. A day later, it was announced that more ambitious plans for London from Mayor Sadiq Khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public.

Vehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but, a year after the VW emissions scandal broke, most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab-based limit.

Action to clean up air is urgently needed across the world, but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years, meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital. The new inhaler has been developed by German medical devices company Bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine, discovered in the 1980s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in 60C heat.

“It is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing, which is bind water, which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage,” said Dr Andreas Bilstein, at Bitop. “It supports the natural barrier.”

When inhaled, this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) and lung cancer, Bilstein said: “Damage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response, and so disease progression is reduced. The perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home.”

The inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution, due to asthma, COPD and bronchitis, with the positive results due to be published soon, Bilstein said.

Ectoine does not interact with cell receptors, so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug. This means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon, at an estimated cost of £17 a month, after Bitop selects a marketing partner. A version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in Germany and Poland, while an ectoine-based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available.

Bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world, as particulate air pollution is not just a European problem: “Especially in Asia – China in particular – the demand for such a product is even higher. I was in New York last week, and the air was also not very clean.”

The protective effect of ectoine was discovered by Prof Jean Krutmann and colleagues at the Leibniz Research Institute for Environmental Medicine, while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage. Bitop funded a series of studies, now published in prominent scientific journals.

“The point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established – there is no more doubt,” Krutmann said. Antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements, he said: “Personally, I think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements.”

Dr Richard Russell, a consultant respiratory physician in the NHS and medical advisor to the British Lung Foundation, who was not involved in the research, said the inhaler was both credible and promising: “Ectoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise, giving you a film of water in times of stress.”

“The work that has been published thus far, in credible, internationally recognised journals, show that this stuff has positive properties, protecting against triggered inflammation,” he told the Guardian. Russell, who also lectures at Imperial College and Oxford University, said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma, COPD and other lung diseases, not only prevention. “It could potentially do so much more. It is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story.”

Krutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount. “It is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects, but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate [air pollution]. The best thing is that we have clean air because then we don’t need any prophylactic treatment. But on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things.”

“It will take many more years, especially in countries like China, and I think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them,” he said.",1

"From the Jewish schvitz to Mesoamerican “houses of heat,” people all over the world have long associated a good sweat with a wide assortment of health benefits. And some of the latest research seems to support those ideas.

One long-term study of middle-aged Finnish men found those who spent time in a sauna 2-3 days a week enjoyed a 23% drop in their risk for a fatal heart disease or episode. The heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently.

“Sauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance, thereby decreasing blood pressure,” says Dr. Ernst van der Wall, chief of cardiology at the Netherlands Leiden University Medical Centre.

In a recent editorial appearing in the Netherlands Heart Journal, van der Wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages. He also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown. “Death in the sauna is a rare event, even in Finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high,” he writes.

Still, the big questions surrounding sauna bathing’s safety have always centered on its occupant’s (and her heart’s) ability to withstand the heat. Traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of 185 degrees, which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes.

Infrared saunas, by contrast, do not heat the air around you. Using electromagnetic radiation, infrared lamps warm your body directly. That may sound freaky or even unsafe, but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled.

“As infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air, users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas,” says Dr. Richard Beever, a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the University of British Columbia.

While there’s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas, Beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject. He says there’s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure, congestive heart failure and chronic pain.

People who spent 15 minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a “room-temperature” space, one Japanese study reported. More research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats, improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart’s vessels.

Beever’s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas—including pain management. Among 46 chronic pain sufferers, those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a 54% improvement in sleep quality and were 27% more likely to return to work compared to a no-sauna group.

Beever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study. Also, he found no strong evidence of lost weight, improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently linked to sauna bathing—infrared or otherwise.

But he also points out that no accidents or adverse reactions occurred in any of the studies he reviewed. (For men hoping to father children, spending time in hot saunas or baths has long been a no-no. Healthy sperm and heat don’t play well together. Beever says infrared heat may damage sperm as do other forms of heat, but at this point there’s no data on those risks.)

So what to think of infrared saunas? The existing evidence, though scanty, suggests spending up to 15 minutes a day in one could benefit your heart and ease symptoms associated with chronic pain. And, for now, there don’t seem to be any significant health risks.

Ask your doctor first. But if you’re wondering whether an infrared sauna is worth a try, the evidence suggests you have little to lose and possibly something to gain by checking one out.

"Jessie Quinn — here with daughter Luna Williams — has been cancer-free for five years, thanks to a transplant of stem cells from a baby’s umbilical cord. (Courtesy of Jessie Quinn)

Jessie Quinn of Sacramento was 36 years old when loss of appetite, weight loss, some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in 2010. Tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia — a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly — and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough; she would need a bone-marrow transplant.

Quinn, who has a science background, knew that finding a donor would be difficult. In college, she had donated to a bone-marrow registry after learning that people like her, with a mixed racial heritage, have a much harder time than others finding a match.

In fact, when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her, only one name came up: her own.

“I didn’t know whether to laugh or cry,” Quinn said.

While searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months, Quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay. What eventually saved her, though, was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby’s umbilical cord, an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types.

This therapy and another — haploidentical transplantation, which uses bone-marrow cells that are only half-matched to a patient — have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years. Every biological child is a half-match for a parent, and vice versa.

“Many patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy,” said Richard Jones, director of the bone-marrow transplant program at Johns Hopkins Kimmel Cancer Center.

A dangerous process

Bone-marrow transplants, which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor, are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person’s immune system.

The transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow, which produces blood cells. The procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient’s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor.

The process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life-threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work.

In the past, a patient’s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near-perfect match, a usually fatal development. Umbilical-cord stem cells, however, are sort of a blank slate because they haven’t been exposed to much life — such as bacteria and viruses — and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren’t a perfect match.

When Quinn’s doctors found no match on the donor registry, she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords, expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients.

He had swollen thumbs, bleeding gums and anemia. He cried whenever anyone touched his legs. Doctors were running out of time. Read the case Cam Cottrill/For The Washington Post Buy Photo Wait 1 second to continue.

Because each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells, umbilical-cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants, which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections. And if cells from several umbilical cords are used, the chances of immunity problems increase.

This expanded cord-blood technique has been a “huge home run” for patients, said Colleen Delaney of the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, who helped create it.

“No one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person,” she said. The advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed-race background, whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none.

“This is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource,” Delaney said. “We can find cord-blood donors for 99 percent of patients who cannot find a donor.”

Quinn was hospitalized for 30 days, and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful. Mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year. She also developed graft-versus-host disease, which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun. But she has been free of cancer for five years.

She remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die.

“It still gives me pause — I went to Costa Rica — that I am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking,” Quinn says. “I was so sure I would never get to do those things again. It’s an indescribable feeling.”

In haploidential transplants, rather than wiping out the patient’s immune system, doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it. This reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow.

‘Everybody now has a donor’

“Parents are always haploidentical. Children are always haploidentical,” Jones said. “Siblings are half the time and all second-degree relatives (grandchildren, nieces, nephews) have a 50 percent chance of being a half-match. . . . Everybody now has a donor, and that is a major advance.”

Yet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone-marrow transplants, Jones said.

“Despite the recent data showing equivalency of half-matched and cord-blood transplants with conventional matched transplants, many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice,” Jones said. “There are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors, and that is unacceptable in the year 2016.”

Jones estimates that about 7,500 transplants of donated stem cells were done in 2014 — primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia — but that more than 15,000 could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available.

Gregg Gordon, 44, developed leukemia in 2011. He noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired. He went to his internist, who drew blood and within 24 hours Gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy.

His wife, Caryn, recalls how little they knew about his disease — acute myeloid leukemia — as doctors discussed treatment with them.

“We knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease,” Caryn Gordon said. “He decided he would be focused on being the patient and said, ‘Do whatever you have to do with me because I want to walk my girls [who were then 12 and 16] down the aisle.’ ”

On advice of their hematologist, the Gordons traveled to Hutchinson, which has established a national reputation as a bone-marrow transplant center, but quickly discovered there was no good donor match.

“We thought we would find a match. It was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible,” Caryn recalled.

According to Be the Match, which operates the national donor program, a patient’s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from 66 to 97 percent, depending on ethnic background.

But Gregg Gordon was able to participate in Delaney’s clinical trial and, like Quinn, received lab-expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation. He also will be five years cancer-free in September.

Not everyone is as lucky. Quinn, Gordon and 11 other participants in Delaney’s clinical trial “are all alive, in remission, at a median age of about 4.7 years,” the researcher said, but two patients died when the disease relapsed.

A larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway.

"Whether you call it water running, aqua jogging or hydrotherapy, you can’t beat a workout in water for an array of health benefits, many experts say. Everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance.

Running and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip, knee and back injuries and surgeries. It’s also an easy-on-the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis, and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill.

It’s just an all-around good aerobic conditioner for athletes, too, sports medicine expert Dr. Naresh Rao, told CBS News. Rao is the Olympic Team USA Water Polo Physician for the 2016 Summer Games.

“We’ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function,” said Rao, who is also with the department of family medicine at Plainview Hospital in Plainview, New York. “I personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues.”

Hydrotherapy uses a water-friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool. Another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank.

Matt Johnson, a physical therapist at St. Luke’s Hospital in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, told CBS News that the tank is basically a freestanding tub, about six feet long by three feet wide, with a motorized belt. The water height can be adjusted to the patient’s abilities. The buoyancy of the water helps someone who’s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they’d be able to do on dry ground, he explained.

“In water, we can teach them sooner. They can really work on their gait, walk without pain, do exercises in water that you wouldn’t be able to do on land,” said Johnson.

A physical therapy patient at St. Luke’s in Bethlehem, Pennsylvania, participates in water therapy in a Hydro Track system by Conray Incorporated. Physical Therapy at St. Luke's Hospital, Bethlehem, Pa.

He uses a HydroTrack Underwater Treadmill System – professional sports teams including the New York Yankees and the Miami Dolphins, have used it, too. The nice thing about it, said Johnson, is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them. It works like a lock on a canal, he said. So, even older patients with limited mobility and balance don’t have to negotiate getting down into a pool.

Johnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height. The treadmill speed can be set anywhere from 0.3 to 7.1 miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle.

“At waist height, it’s at about 50 percent of body weight. At chest height, it’s about 30 percent of body weight,” Johnson said, noting, for example, that a person with an injured knee who weighs 100 pounds who is running in waist-high water would only feel like 50 pounds on the bad knee.

“Taking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer,” said Johnson.

A recent study in the American Journal of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors. Researchers asked 21 patients who’d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests – one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill. They gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn’t go any further. Walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption (VO2max), a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise, and metabolic equivalents, a measure of energy use.

“The study proposes a different, very innovative approach” to rehabilitation after stroke, said Dr. Gisele Wolf-Klein, director of geriatric education at Northwell Health in Great Neck, New York.

Wolfe-Klein told CBS News she has tried water workouts and said you don’t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up. “It’s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you’re trying to do – allowing a cardio-respiratory response,” Wolfe-Klein told CBS News.

She noted that medicine’s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses.

Michael Phelps, Simone Manuel make history in Rio

Budd Coates, training director at Runner’s World magazine, said runners don’t just plunge into water​ therapy when they’re injured; it’s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes, too. Some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water-safe and can be plunked right in the water.

An alternative to a water treadmill: Some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against.

“It creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place,” said Coates.

For those without access to a water treadmill, you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat. Some pools may loan them out, too.

Or, Coates suggested, just try it freeform with waist- or chest-high water to start. If you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool, look for one that has a slanting beach-style entry into the water, or one with a robotic chair lift. Ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you.

If running’s not your thing, but the water looks inviting, Coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater.

Coates said the beauty of water running (or even walking) is that it’s great for any age and any level of ability, from elderly stroke survivors to Olympic athletes.

Galen Rupp, the 2016 Rio Olympics​ men’s marathon bronze medalist, relies on it as part of his training.

“He and some of the other guys on the Nike team, it’s well known they take advantage of the anti-gravity treadmill and the aqua track,” Coates said.",1

Personal Health Jane Brody on health and aging.

Ever since the large government study called the Women’s Health Initiative found a number of risks associated with menopause hormones, millions of women who are in or near menopause have been weathering hot flashes and other symptoms on their own. But now, new research suggests that the benefits of short-term hormone treatment to control life-disrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks — as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause.

There are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement. And there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment.

For women without a history of cancer, blood clots or heart disease, most professional medical societies concerned with women’s health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone.

Every day, about 6,000 women in the United States — more than two million women a year — enter menopause. At an average age of 51, they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle.

For months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins, many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity, sleep, moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse.

The most common symptom — hot flashes — can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night. Menopause-related vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort, pain and bleeding with exercise, vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence.

Until the early 2000s, many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy — H.R.T. — to counter them. Even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used H.R.T. because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases, and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging.

Then in 2002, the results of the largest randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement, the Women’s Health Initiative (W.H.I.), created a kind of menopausal panic, prompting millions of middle-age women to stop or not start hormone treatments and doctors to not prescribe them.

The study found that, among the women treated with the hormones, there was an increased risk of heart attacks, strokes, blood clots and, most frightening of all to many women, a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading H.R.T. regimen of conjugated equine estrogens (Premarin) and a synthetic progesterone (Provera) recommended for women who still had a uterus. (Those without a uterus, who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone, had no increase in breast cancer; in fact, they had a slight decrease over all.)

The hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer, but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women, the risks of H.R.T. seemed — on the surface — to outweigh the benefits.

However, according to Dr. JoAnn E. Manson, an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the W.H.I., “The W.H.I. findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted,” and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment. “The pendulum has swung too far,” she said.

The W.H.I. study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms. Most of the 27,347 women entering the study were already in their 60s and 70s, already a decade or more past menopause. Rather, the study was designed to determine whether H.R.T. did, in fact, reduce the risk of heart disease, the leading killer of American women. Among these older women, it found no such effect.

In the years after the W.H.I. findings, many new analyses and studies have prompted experts to rethink the wisdom of avoiding hormone replacement, especially for women within a few years of menopause whose personal and family history do not place them at high risk of breast cancer.

Experts like Dr. Manson, professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Brigham & Women’s Hospital, maintain that the results of the W.H.I. study are not relevant to the more common use of H.R.T. for women in their 50s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments.

Dr. Howard N. Hodis, a preventive cardiologist at the University of Southern California, said the billion-dollar W.H.I. study made “a big mistake” by starting the hormones in older women, when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred. “The cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking H.R.T.,” he said.

In a Danish randomized controlled trial of 1,006 women entering menopause, among those given hormones for 10 years, “there was a reduction in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer — a clear benefit with nominal risk,” Dr. Hodis said. These benefits persisted after 16 years of follow-up, according to the study, which was published in 2012.

Dr. Hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and don’t need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer.

In an analysis in 2013 in the American Journal of Public Health, Dr. Philip M. Sarrel and his co-authors calculated that, based on reduced death rates among women taking only estrogen in the W.H.I. study, avoiding hormone replacement resulted in the premature deaths of 18,601 to 91,610 women in the decade after the study’s release.

Dr. Manson is distressed about the large number of women — about a third of those now on hormone replacement — who are relying on “custom-compounded” products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the Food and Drug Administration. They come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages, she said.

“There’s little or no reason to go the custom-compound route,” she said. “Women today have so many options — a wide array of doses, from low to traditional, and ways to use them.” In addition to pills, there are patches, gels and sprays applied to the skin. Vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast cancer.

To help women and their doctors assess H.R.T. options and select the best treatment for women 45 and older with menopausal symptoms, the North American Menopause Society has developed a mobile app, MenoPro, for iPhone/iPad and Android devices.

"For women older than 50 who have been confused by conflicting advice on how frequently to get a mammogram, some new science is here to guide their decisions.

An ambitious research effort published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine set out to tailor women’s breast cancer screening practices to match their actual risk of breast cancer. It concludes that a woman’s breast density should influence the frequency with which she is screened for breast cancer, in addition to such long-recognized breast cancer risk factors as age, ethnicity, personal history of abnormal breast findings and a family history of breast cancer.

For a small slice of those women, that makes a once-a-year mammogram — twice as often as the current standard — the best bet.

Underwritten by the National Cancer Institute, the new study combined the data-collection efforts of breast-cancer epidemiologists with three separate teams of cancer modelers. In the study, women were separated into subcategories based on four levels each of individual risk and breast density.

The research recommends that women older than 50 with dense breast tissue who have higher-than-normal risk of developing breast cancer should get annual mammograms. These women, however, represent a small minority of women in that age group — less than 1% of all women between 50 and 74.

Many women, however, could go as long as three years between mammograms without increasing their risk of death from breast cancer, the study found. For women with average risk and low breast density, the models showed that there was no difference in deaths averted from breast cancer whether they were screened every two years or every three years. Women who had a mammogram every three years, however, had fewer unnecessary follow-up procedures, including biopsies.

Accepted clinical guidelines recommend that women 50 to 74 get a mammogram every two years. These recommendations, first proposed in 2009 by a federal task force, urged women to discuss with their physicians whether more frequent screening might be in order. But they have continued to be controversial with some activist and medical groups that believe additional lives could be saved if more women got an annual mammogram.

The latest study largely validates the controversial recommendations made by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009. But it also clarifies which women should or could depart safely from its recommendations.

Only in the last decade or so have radiologists, oncologists and women’s health specialists begun to appreciate the role of breast density in a woman’s breast cancer risk. While radiologists have long warned that dense breast tissue made cancerous masses harder to spot, mounting evidence has found that cancer is also more likely to gain a foothold in dense breast tissue.

The latest effort is the first to produce a risk calculator that takes that into account, and asks for a radiologist’s standardized assessment of breast density in its six-point questionnaire. Many states now require radiologists reading mammograms to assign and communicate to a woman and her physician this density measure, called a Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, or BI-RADS, score.

Overall, the risk measure calculates a woman’s likelihood of developing breast cancer over five and 10 years, and compares it to normal risk.

In devising their models, the researchers updated assumptions that have cast doubt on the relevance of existing breast-cancer risk calculators, which relied on the experiences of women who got an earlier generation of screening mammograms and were more likely to die of breast cancer than is currently the case. Here, teams of modelers from Erasmus University in the Netherlands, Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York and Harvard Pilgrim Healthcare assumed that women were getting digital mammograms, which offer improved cancer detection rates at lower radiation dosages than earlier mammographic methods. They took into account improved rates of breast cancer treatment effectiveness, and changing causes of mortality for women older than 50. They also took account of the fact that breast density decreases in older women.

“These models are very applicable to the populations we screen,” said UC San Francisco breast-cancer specialist Dr. Karla Kerlikowske, one of the lead authors of the new study.

The practice of tailoring screening intervals to a woman’s breast cancer risk is already widespread in some European countries, including Sweden, the Netherlands and Spain. A Spanish study, similar to the latest modeling effort, found that implementing a general three-year screening interval, with yearly screening for high-risk women, reduced overdiagnosis and caught more missed cancers.

“Some lesions detected in screening will never grow to become clinically significant and will not impact a woman’s life,” Kerlikowske said.

"If a pill could prevent teenagers from taking dangerous risks, would you consider it for your children?

I’d be tempted. My skateboard- and bicycle-riding son was hit by a car—twice—when he was a teenager. I would have welcomed anything that could have averted those dreadful phone calls from the emergency room.

While some bumps and scares are inevitable for active guys like him, serious misadventures with long-lasting repercussions are often par for the course for a subset of them—those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, or ADHD. But a new article suggests that early medication can significantly cut the odds of bad things happening later.

Affecting nearly 9% of all Americans between 4 and 18 years of age, ADHD is one of the most common childhood disorders and also one of the most misunderstood. Its symptoms color almost every aspect of a child’s life—from being able to focus in school to making and keeping friends, reining in fleeting impulses and assessing risk and danger.

Indeed, accidents are the most common cause of death in individuals with ADHD, with one 2015 study of over 710,000 Danish children finding that 10- to 12-year-olds with ADHD were far more likely to be injured than other children their age. Drug treatment made a big difference, however, nearly halving the number of emergency room visits by children with ADHD.

Medicating children to address problems with attention and self-control remains controversial. ADHD isn’t visible, like chickenpox, nor immediately life-threatening, like asthma. Its distortion of a child’s ability to meet adults’ expectations creates an atmosphere of frustration and blame. So it’s not often taken for what it really is: a neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic roots.

An enduring myth about ADHD is that children grow out of it in adolescence. We now know that a 5-year-old with a bona fide attentional disorder may well become a dreamy, restless and impulsive teenager and adult. Adolescents with ADHD think even less about consequences than the average teenager and are especially thrilled by novelty. They’re more likely than their friends to drink too much, drive like maniacs, abuse drugs and have unprotected sex.

It’s a sobering list. But an article published last month by Princeton researchers Anna Chorniy and Leah Kitashima in the journal Labour Economics shows that treating ADHD with medication during childhood can head off later problems. “We have 11 years of data for every child enrolled in South Carolina Medicaid who was diagnosed with ADHD,” Dr. Chorniy told me. The researchers tracked each doctor visit and every prescription, with a sample of over 58,000 children whose health progress they tracked into adulthood.

This long view let the economists compare the behaviors of teens treated with the most common ADHD medications, such as Ritalin, Concerta and Adderall, to the types of risks taken by other children with ADHD who were not treated. The researchers found fewer and less severe injuries and health problems among the treated children: a 3.6% reduction in sexually transmitted infections; 5.8% fewer children who sought screening for sexually transmitted infections (suggesting they had had an unprotected sexual tryst); and 2% fewer teen pregnancies.

That adds up to a lot fewer teenagers in trouble.

The economists did their study based on existing data, but randomized, controlled studies—experiments carefully designed to establish cause-and-effect relationships—have reached the same conclusion: that medication to control ADHD can reduce the high price in psychic pain, loss of educational opportunity and riven relationships. A child whose disorder is diagnosed and treated early by a trained clinician stands a better chance of growing into a healthy and thoughtful adult.",1
"Could Worms In Your Gut Cure Your Allergies?

When you first meet Moises Velasquez-Manoff, the first thing you notice is his hair — or the lack of it.

toggle caption NPR

He's completely bald.

""At age 11, I developed this condition, called alopecia areata, where I lost my hair,"" says Velasquez-Manoff, a science writer in Berkeley, Calif. ""It started in patches, but eventually I lost it all.""

A few years ago Velasquez-Manoff was working on a book about autoimmune diseases, like allergies, asthma, Crohn's disease and alopecia. He talked to many people who were using an unlikely tool to treat their problems: parasitic worms that live in your gut — permanently.

The worms were getting rave reviews. ""People were saying, 'I had absolutely zero symptoms. And my disease went into remission!'"" Velasquez-Manoff says.

So he started to wonder: Could these worms cure his alopecia? Maybe his hay fever, too?

He went down to Mexico, bought 30 hookworms and let the larvae infect him.

Hookworm larvae are microscopic. But they have little spikes that puncture the skin and allow the larvae to burrow inside you. Then the critters head straight for a capillary.

""They basically ride your bloodstream back through your heart, into your lungs,"" where they hang out for a while, Velasquez-Manoff says.

Then the larvae crawl out of the lung through your stomach and into the small intestine — where they bite onto the intestinal wall and start sucking blood — a few drops a day.

At that point, the worms do something amazing: They suppress the immune system, says P'ng Loke, an immunologist at the New York University School of Medicine.

""That's the really fascinating thing,"" he says. You see, the worms don't shut down the immune system completely — just enough so that the immune cells won't attack the worm.

But this can help with something else. It can keep the immune system from getting out of control and attacking the body.

""If you think about it, the worst thing that you want is an immune system that's out of control,"" Loke says.

Why? Because that's when you get autoimmune problems. So the hypothesis is that intestinal worms could possibly reverse these problems, by damping down the immune system.

The idea was so promising, that back in 2011 a pharmaceutical company decided to test it in clinical trials. Coronado Biosciences put together about six large studies.

The first study to finish was a big one in Europe that looked to see if pig whipworms helped with Crohn's disease.

The bottom line: ""The proportion of patients who improved with the worms was no different than the proportion of patients who were improved with placebo,"" says Dr. Stephen Hanauer at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, who was involved with one trial.

The whipworms were so ineffective at stopping Crohn's disease that Coronado canceled its other trials. The company's stock plummeted. And eventually the company changed its name and focus.

Other trials with worms haven't gone so well either, says Hanauer. ""The controlled trials, thus far, in a variety of different diseases including childhood allergies and asthma have not been positive.""

It's unclear why the worms haven't worked in these trials, Loke says. It could be that the whipworm larvae weren't prepared correctly. Or that the worms work for some people but not others. It may depend on a person's genes.

Back in Berkeley, Velasquez-Manoff thought he might one of the lucky ones.

A little while after he took the hookworms, his hay fever disappeared.

""Like just gone, gone, gone,"" he says.

And his hair?

""Then I had like, little bit of peach fuzzy hair growing here and there on my body,"" Velasquez-Manoff says.

But then the tide turned. ""Suddenly it's like one day, the whole thing reversed.""

His hay fever came back. The hair didn't grow anymore.

And having worms in his body wasn't pleasant. At first, he had diarrhea and cramps. That got better. But even months later, he still felt kind of bad.

""I never got back to feeling completely normal for that year [that the worms were inside],"" Velasquez-Manoff says.

He says the benefits of the worms definitely didn't outweigh the bad side effects. And he would never try treating his alopecia or hay fever with them again.

""The way I thought of it was, would I give this to my kids? And the answer is pretty easily and obviously: Hell no,"" Velasquez-Manoff says. ""I wouldn't want them to feel this way.""",1
"Alzheimer’s disease, the most common form of dementia, can be fully cured with an anti-inflammatory drug commonly used for period pain, a new research by the University of Manchester shows. Currently, no drug medications can successfully treat chronic neurodegenerative disease, but certain medicines can help alleviate symptoms or slow down the progression.

Researchers, who conducted the study on mice, found that mefenamic acid — a common Non-Steroidal Anti Inflammatory Drug (NSAID) used to relieve menstrual pain — can completely reverse memory loss and brain inflammation that are hallmark changes of Alzheimer’s, which currently affects over five million Americans.

For the study, researchers used 20 transgenic mice that develop symptoms of Alzheimer’s disease. The research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems. They were divided in groups of 10. First group was given mefenamic acid dose and the other group was given placebo for one month through a mini-pump implanted under the skin.

Researchers observed that memory loss was fully reversed to the levels seen in mice without Alzheimer’s.

“There is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes Alzheimer’s disease worse. Our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid, a simple [NSAID] can target an important inflammatory pathway called the NLRP3 inflammasome, which damages brain cells,” David Brough, lead author of the study said, in a statement.

Brough, however, cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the long-term implications.

“However, much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don't always faithfully replicate the human disease. Because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known, the time for it to reach patients should, in theory, be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs,” Brough said.

Researchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat Alzheimer’s by blocking a particular part of the immune response. But, they also warned that these “drugs are not without side effects and should not be taken for Alzheimer’s disease at this stage - studies in people are needed first.”

The research was published in the journal Nature Communications on Thursday.",1

"Researchers out of the University of Leicester have developed a new asthma pill for the first time in 20 years, which they believe will significantly improve symptoms for those with severe asthma. The drug, known as Fevipiprant (QAW039), was shown to reduce asthma symptoms as well as inflammation, and it improved lung function and repaired airway linings.

The pill may be a “game changer for future treatment of asthma,” said Professor Chris Brightling, a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Senior Research Fellow at the University of Leicester, in a press release.

In the study, the researchers examined 61 participants who were divided into two groups: The first was given 225mg of the drug twice a day for 12 weeks, and the second group was given a placebo. By measuring the sputum eosinophil — the inflammation marker that shows how white blood cells increase during asthma attacks — the researchers were able to track the effects of the drug. When asthma symptoms occur, the number of white blood cells rises, and this measurement is used to define how severe the condition is. For people with asthma, a sputum eosinophil reading will typically be around five percent, compared to people without asthma, who have readings that are lower than one percent.

As the researchers tracked the participants over the course of 12 weeks, they found that those taking the drug saw a decrease in their sputum eosinophil reading from an average of 5.4 percent to 1.1 percent.

“A unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms, lung function using breathing tests, sampling of the airway wall and CT scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works,” said Brightling in the press release. “Most treatments might improve some of these features of disease, but with Fevipiprant improvements were seen with all the types of tests. We already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks.”

Ultimately, the researchers hope that the drug “could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks, reduce hospital admissions and improve day-to-day symptoms – making it a ‘game changer’ for future treatment,” said Brightling.

"Many heart doctor will tell you that one of the best ways to keep your heart healthy is to include more healthy oils, such as omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, in your diet. Studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease, and fewer heart attacks (though the same can’t necessarily be true of those who take supplements—see this piece “Fish Oil Is Hugely Popular—But Should You Take It? for more on that).

One thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. Can omega-3 fat provide similar benefit? Researchers led by Dr. Raymond Kwong at Brigham and Women’s Hospital wanted to find out, so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it’s changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack.

For the study, published in the journal Circulation, they studied nearly 360 people who recently had a heart attack, who were randomly assigned to take 4g of omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months. (That’s a high dose; a 3 oz. portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to 1g of omega-3.) Every two months, the volunteers came in for an MRI of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing.

Normally after a heart attack, part of the heart is starved of oxygen, and that portion never recovers. The remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue, but has to work harder to maintain the heart’s normal pumping function. Over time, this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue’s ability to do its job.

Kwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega-3 fats showed 6% less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo. What’s more, the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega-3 fats (people absorb it at different rates) showed the greatest reduction in scarring — 13% — compared to those with the lowest levels. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications.

“The omega-3 fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack,” says Kwong.

Based on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack.

It’s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart after a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be.

Kwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response. The 4g is a high dose; previous studies in which people were given 1g of fish oil were more inconsistent. Most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack. Might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner? How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way?

These are questions Kwong and others hope to answer with more studies. Kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega-3 fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack. “To say every [heart attack] patient should be taking omega-3 fatty acids right away is a bit premature,” he says. “But I do think it’s logical that our results hold promise, and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack.”

"Brynne Henn, 26, leaned back onto a pristine white couch and settled white-and-red headphones over her ears. She picked up a handset, grasping one buzzer in each hand, closed her eyes, and the session began.

The room was quiet. Through the headphones, Henn heard an alternating tone — first in the right ear, then the left, back and forth. The handset buzzed in synchrony, right-left-right-left, part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories. She turned her thoughts to the day her brother, Nate, died.

Nate Henn had been visiting relatives and working with Invisible Children, a nonprofit in Kampala, Uganda. On July 11, 2010, he was at a sports complex with friends, enjoying the broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, when terrorists struck. Nate was only 25 when shrapnel from a bomb ended his life.

The years hadn’t diminished Brynne Henn’s pain.

“ ‘Your brother’s dead, and you need to come home to take care of your mom,’ ” she remembered her father saying. With those simple words, her brother was gone — and she felt compelled to take control in the ensuing chaos. Henn, who had been visiting her boyfriend in Chapel Hill, immediately returned home to Raleigh, N.C.

“I didn’t stop for the first week after Nate died,” she said.

The ordeal didn’t end with the news of Nate’s death. Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived.

“And then the media storm went crazy,” Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate’s death; Kyle’s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh.

“It made it so much worse,” Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. “I felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,” she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her.

Complicated grief

When a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened. The brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly, even in safe situations.

When Henn’s traumatic memories of her brother’s violent death were triggered, they “popped” and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen.

“All these memories around me started playing like a video loop,” Henn said. Her body remembered the sensations vividly: the heat and discomfort of the summer day, the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral.

Henn did cognitive behavioral therapy — a form of conventional talk therapy — for five years.

“It helped me realize feelings were normal,” she explained, and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy. “But I never felt like I was getting over it.” Random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear. Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn’t address the root cause.

Henn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year. She was surprised. She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events — not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda.

It was Kyle Henn, recovering from his own PTSD after surviving the plane crash, who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, or EMDR.

Psychologist Francine Shapiro developed EMDR in 1987. Three years later, she founded the EMDR Institute, which has trained more than 100,000 practitioners.

Some therapists use sounds from headphones during a session. Others use eye movement, moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows, eyes moving left to right and back again. Others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another.

Patients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories. They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed.

The idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections.

Studies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook “Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders.” “The question is whether stimulation adds to it.” He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy.

Brynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin’s office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her.

The techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother’s death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear.

Some insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn’s does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket.

Henn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR.

“It is so weird,” she said. “When I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones — I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?”

But Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. “I started getting really interested in it,” she said. “Why is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?” Henn was surprised by the vivid memories — some of which she hadn’t known existed — that resurfaced after so much time had passed.

Reliving the memories

It didn’t matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, “you have to go through it again until it has no meaning.” By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful.

“It’s integrating what’s stuck in time,” explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. “EMDR processing is untangling the knot.”

Once the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid — less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic.

EMDR’s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure — an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it.

“I’m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,” Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people.

Soon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a “full-fledged panic attack,” she said.

“I was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,” she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down.

“The thought came into my head: ‘I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,’ ” Henn remembered. “And I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth” — actions reminiscent of EMDR processing.

“It took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,” she said. “But the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before.”

In a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother’s absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate’s point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day.

“Does EMDR deal with the future?” she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again.

Among the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory — friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family — and a smile broke through the tears.

“It felt like a gift from Nate,” she said.

EMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over — to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain.

“I’m still sad, but I’m not hurt by it anymore,” she said. “It’s not opening up any fresh wounds.”

As Henn walked outside into a brisk April evening after her session, there was a new easiness to her, as though something had finally been freed.",1
"Millions of Americans suffer from pet allergies that prevent them from enjoying the benefits of owning a dog or a cat. Thea Joyce is among them, but couldn’t bear the thought of having to give up her two cats, Kirby and Lennon.

“It was really bad,” Joyce, 29, told FoxNews.com. “I was just itchy all the time and sneezing all the time. I was really uncomfortable and miserable.”

Joyce tried over-the-counter medications but couldn’t find relief. She consulted an allergist at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, where a clinical trial involving immunotherapy toothpaste was taking place.

The toothpaste, called Allerdent, works to keep breath fresh and fight cavities while also offering the same benefits as an allergy shot or drops. Researchers found that applying the extracts found in a shot to the lining of a patient’s mouth worked just as well to alleviate symptoms.

“The patients who came in were treated for the very things that they were sensitive to, and that included indoor allergens, like dustmite and pet dander, as well as outdoor allergens such as tree pollen, grass pollen, ragweed pollen,” Dr. William Reisacher, an associate professor of otolaryngology and director of allergy services at Weill Cornell Medicine/New York-Presbyterian Hospital, told FoxNews.com.

Joyce, who lives in the Bronx, New York, signed on for the year-long study that required six of the 12 volunteers to brush their teeth for two minutes using two pumps of the toothpaste in either the morning or night, and the other six to use drops under their tongue. Volunteers using the toothpaste were also required to log their usage in a journal.

Both groups reported a significant decrease in their symptoms, including Joyce, who was in the toothpaste group.

Allerdent is not covered by insurance, meaning Joyce spends about $400 every three months but said the cost is worth it.

“I used to be so irritable because I was so uncomfortable,” Joyce said. “But now I don’t really feel allergy symptoms anymore.”

"Anxiety disorders plague more than one in four adolescents between the ages of 13 and 18, and many of them are treated with antidepressants and other medications to try and help them live a relatively healthy childhood. But a team of researchers from the University of Cincinnati set out to explore other treatment options that focus more on the mind and less on pharmaceutical solutions.

Their study, published in the Journal of Child and Adolescent Psychopharmacology, recruited nine participants who were diagnosed with anxiety disorders between 9 and 16 years of age. These conditions included generalized, social, and separation anxiety disorder as well as having a parent with bipolar disorder. Over the course of 12 weeks, each participant underwent functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scans while they practiced mindfulness-based cognitive therapy, a wide range of theraputic techiniques that include meditation, yoga, and learning how to pay nonjudgmental attention to one's life.

""These integrative approaches expand traditional treatments and offer new strategies for coping with psychological distress,” said the study’s co-author Sian Cotton, director of the UC's Center for Integrative Health and Wellness, in a statement. ""Mindfulness-based therapeutic interventions promote the use of meditative practices to increase present-moment awareness of conscious thoughts, feelings, and body sensations in an effort to manage negative experiences more effectively.”

Children who are at a high risk for bipolar disorder or other anxiety disorders, such as the participants, often have poor coping skills when confronted by stress, and only a lucky few get help. According to the Anxiety and Depression Association of America, 80 percent of children with a diagnosed anxiety disorder and 60 percent of those diagnosed with depression do not receive treatment. Some mental health professionals have suggested that mindfulness exercises can help bridge the treatment gap, and there is some encouraging, if early, evidence showing that these techniques can be used to prevent relapses of depression or anxiety.

Cotton noted the anxiety of their patients was significantly reduced following treatment, and the more mindfulness they practiced, the less anxious they felt. Both findings reaffirm the potential that mindfulness therapy could bring to the table. If nothing else, it might allow people who would be reluctant to take medication more treatments to choose from. ""Increasingly, patients and families are asking for additional therapeutic options, in addition to traditional medication-based treatments, that have proven effectiveness for improved symptom reduction. Mindfulness-based therapies for mood disorders is one such example with promising evidence,"" said Cotton, adding the university is both studying and implenting these therapies.

After the 12-week experiment, Cotton and his colleagues found mindfulness therapy increased neural activity in a part of the brain that plays in a role in processing cognitive and emotion information known as the cingulate. The therapy was also able to increase brain activity in the insula, a part of the brain that helps monitor how the body feels psychologically.

""This raises the possibility that treatment-related increases in brain activity during emotional processing may improve emotional processing in anxious youth who are at risk for developing bipolar disorder,” said fellow co-author Dr. Jeffrey Strawn, a professor in UC's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Neuroscience, as well as director of the Anxiety Disorders Research Program, in a statement. ""The path from understanding the effects of psychotherapy on brain activity to the identification of treatment response is a challenging one, and will require additional studies of emotional processing circuits.”

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A computerized brain training program cut the risk of dementia among healthy people by 48 percent, U.S. researchers said on Sunday in reporting an analysis of the results of a 10-year study.

The preliminary findings, presented at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Toronto, are the first to show that any kind of intervention could delay the development of dementia in normal, healthy adults.

To date, cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists have largely rejected evidence that computer-based cognitive-training software or “brain games” have any effect on cognitive function.

The new findings would be quite promising if they hold up through peer review and publication in a scientific journal, said Dr. John King, an expert in social research at the National Institute of Aging. The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study.

King worked on the original clinical trial on which the new analysis is based. The study, known as Active, examined the effects of cognitive training programs on 2,785 healthy older adults.

Participants were divided into three groups. One got training for memory improvement, one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed-of-processing.

In the speed training, which emphasized visual perception, individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly. The program got harder with each correct answer.

Participants had 10 one-hour training sessions conducted in a classroom setting over five weeks. Some received four additional “booster” sessions one year after the original training, and four more two years after that.

Scientists measured cognitive and functional changes immediately and at one, two, three, five and 10 years after the training to see if it affected how participants performed daily tasks.

Results of that study, published in 2014, found modest benefits in the reasoning and speed-of-processing groups, but not memory.

The new analysis was by Dr. Jerri Edwards of the University of South Florida, whose mentor, Dr. Karlene Ball of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, sold her rights to the program to Posit Science. Edwards also was a paid consultant for the company for part of 2008.

The program is now incorporated in Posit Science’s BrainHQ.com brain training program.

Edwards did a secondary analysis of the 10-year data, looking at the time it took individuals to develop dementia.

She found that the group that did speed training showed 33 percent less risk of dementia relative to the control group, while the memory and the reasoning interventions offered no such benefit.

People who completed 11 or more speed training sessions were at 48 percent less risk for developing dementia over the 10 years of the study, Edwards said.

“At first blush, that’s kind of a big deal,” Mayo Clinic Alzheimer’s expert Dr. Ronald Petersen said. “This may even be clinically relevant.”

In 2014, a group of nearly 70 neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists led by researchers at Stanford University’s Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development signed a letter saying there was “little evidence” of such results from brain games. The letter was in response to heavy marketing by companies touting the benefits of their programs based on scant scientific data.

Edwards said she was frustrated with the scientific debate, which is one reason she agreed to present her findings before they were published. “I’m sick of our studies being ignored,” she said.

King said the training offered in the program was slightly different from the current Posit Science offering and that it was unclear whether speed training would help people who are already at risk for dementia.

“It’s a promising result from an interesting data set,” he said. “I do think we will know more after the paper is reviewed.”",1

Getting pregnant can be tricky. One way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when she’s most fertile, a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes. And certain body-tracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics, like your heart rate and body temperature. Depending on the device, it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive. Recently, the women’s health data startup Clue ran an internal test to see if Fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant. Scientists put Fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles. The devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began, according to the Berlin company, which presented data from the small, preliminary study at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology's annual meeting this month.

“It’s a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.”

The advantage of a passive sensor is ""these things are done kind of autonomously so you don't need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up,"" Clue's head of scientific research, Dr. Vedrana Högqvist Tabor, told BuzzFeed News. ""It's a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant.""

Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background. After a Kickstarter campaign, YONO just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest. And Ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive.

Fitbit

How an Activity Tracker Caught an Unexpected Pregnancy Fitness trackers, by nature of being worn around the clock, have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works — and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days. That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue’s study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn’t set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman’s resting heart rate changes when she’s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That’s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue’s app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman’s “fertile window” — when she’s likeliest to get pregnant — usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation.

Clue

As the researchers had hypothesized, the participants' Fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation, as well as during ovulation itself. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, Högqvist Tabor said. And the study had one particularly unexpected outcome. Clue’s marketing director, who was participating, was puzzled when her Fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute. Högqvist Tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant, and broke the news to the marketing director: She was pregnant. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife’s Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. Upon a Redditor’s suggestion, she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant. An expert told BuzzFeed News at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature, another symptom of pregnancy. But Don't Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue’s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it's possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, Högqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems.

Manually figuring out your fertile days is a laborious, multi-step process you have to do every single day.

However, Högqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit — so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you’re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn’t revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (Högqvist Tabor says it's tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.)

One reason to potentially shy away from trusting Fitbit’s heart-rate sensors: In a class-action lawsuit, some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate. Regardless, Clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices’ ability to capture the day-to-day differences in someone’s resting heart rate, which seemed to be consistent, and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate. “You will get a relative change, even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap,” said Clue co-founder Mike LaVigne.

Obese children who cut sugar from their diets saw improvements in markers of heart disease after just nine days, a study in Atherosclerosis found.

For the study, researchers evaluated 37 children ages 9 to 18 who were obese and at high risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. The children were given food and drinks totaling the same number of calories, fat, protein and carbohydrates as their typical diets.

The only change was their sugar intake: The researchers swapped foods high in added sugars, like pastries and sweetened yogurts, for options like bagels and pizza. This lowered dietary sugar from 28 percent to 10 percent, and fructose from 12 percent to 4 percent of total calories.

After nine days, the researchers found a 33 percent drop in triglycerides, a type of fat tied to heart disease; a 49 percent reduction in a protein called apoC-III that is tied to high triglyceride levels; and large reductions in small, dense LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease.

Though this study is small and short-term, it builds on this group’s previous research implicating added sugars as a contributor to metabolic disorders and heart disease.

“Sugar calories are not like other carbohydrate calories,” said Dr. Robert Lustig, a co-author of the study and professor of pediatrics at Benioff Children’s Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco. “Without changing total carbohydrate, or fat, or protein, we were able to accomplish this enormous improvement in their cardiovascular risk factors,” unrelated to weight loss, he said.",1
"When U.S. Marine Chris Merkle returned from his last tour of duty in Afghanistan, his family was thrilled to have him back.

But for Merkle, the welcome home was also accompanied by some dark problems. He couldn’t sleep. He was irritable and had anger issues. He would avoid certain stressful situations, like driving in traffic. And he would stay on high alert in the classroom.

“And then soon, they’re like, 'You’re not the same,'” Merkle recalled of what his family told him. “They start to notice that you’re not really enjoying the parties of our friends. You only get really excited when you're going to visit former Marines and the people you used to hang out with.”

Chris Merkle

Merkle served three tours in Iraq and four in Afghanistan. Re-adjusting to being a civilian was tough, he said, and he was finding it difficult to function.

“There was almost 5, 10 years of deploying back and forth back and forth -- there was this void, this monster in the room that’s not talked about until finally it came out. It was like, 'You need to see somebody. Something is going on with you.'""

While Merkle was a patient at the VA, he heard of a clinical psychologist named Skip Rizzo at the University of Southern California Institute of Creative Technologies. Merkle was trying traditional one-on-one therapy and said that at the time, “it wasn’t really taking that well.” He was looking for an alternative and heard about Skip’s research that used a new and unexpected way to treat post-traumatic stress disorder -- with virtual reality.

Nearly 8 million adults suffer from PTSD during a given year, according to the National Center for PTSD. The condition can occur after someone has been exposed to a significant stressor and often includes symptoms such as avoidance, hyper-vigilance, anger issues and mood swings. One common method for treatment is called “exposure therapy.” The patient recounts their trauma, visualizing it in their imagination, and narrates it to a clinician. By repeatedly confronting and processing the trauma, the brain can start to reduce the level of anxiety and response to those memories.

That’s exactly the approach Rizzo uses with virtual reality therapy.

“My mission is to drag psychology kicking and screaming into the 21st century,” Rizzo said, noting that virtual reality offers a unique opportunity for clinicians and clients alike: to be immersed in the environment that evokes the original trauma, rather than relying on the patient’s imagination.

Rizzo has created 14 virtual “worlds” for patients, and clinicians can add custom elements, including helicopters, clouds, small-arms fire and missiles.

USC Institute for Creative Technologies

“The first thing to keep in mind is that we are never going to replicate an exact simulation of what the patient went through,” Rizzo said. “But we really don’t need to.”

Merkle explained how the virtual reality experience works. “Your brain assumes, 'OK, this must be where we’re at,' and it fills in the blanks. And as you’re talking through it, you feel like you’re physically there.”

Each session lasts for about an hour and a half, and the patient speaks about their experience with a clinician as they go through the virtual simulation.

For Merkle, virtual reality allowed him to start unlocking memories and work through his trauma.

“So, it really allowed me to open the door and begin my healing process,” he said. “I’m still a work in process obviously but I’m so far forward, leaps and bound beyond where I would have been without virtual reality.”

"Could root canal procedures go by the wayside in the not-too-distant future?

Scientists from the University of Nottingham and Harvard University's Wyss Institute hope so. They're developing a new treatment strategy that could someday help heal a damaged tooth using the patient's own stem cells.

Though the work is still in its early stages, and has not yet been tested in people, the scientists won an award from the Royal Society of Chemistry for their idea: regenerative dental fillings.

When dental pulp disease and injury happen, a root canal is typically performed to remove the infected tissues, explained Dr. Adam Celiz, Marie Curie Research Fellow at the University of Nottingham.

Instead of the current dental materials used on fillings, which are toxic to cells, the new approach harnesses stem cells instead.

""What we found is a material that can potentially regenerate components of a patients' tooth,"" Celiz told CBS News.

""We're trying to provide an alternative material, an alternative therapy,"" he said, because the current method involves the dentist removing all of the infected pulp tissue, ""scraping it out, and it can be very painful.""

The process works by stimulating native stem cells inside teeth, triggering repair and regeneration of pulp tissues.

""We hope to eventually encourage dentin regeneration. Dentin is the protective layer that sits on top of the pulp tissue. It's a barrier between enamel and the soft tissue that contains all the blood vessels and cells,"" Celiz explained.

CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook put it in simple terms: ""The cells in the area of a root canal, in the pulp, those are normally asleep. It's like this material goes over and just taps it on the shoulder and says, 'Wake up, wake up,' and then it starts to repair itself.""

The stem cell procedure is in the earliest stages of development, said Celiz.

""We have tested it in cell cultures and we're moving it along into rodents,"" he said. ""It's hard to put timeline on it, but we're talking years before we test it in humans.""

""We're hoping this approach can bring regenerative medicine into the dentistry field,"" said Celiz.

If successful, a treatment like this could someday offer significant benefits for millions of dental patients each year.",1

FRIDAY, July 8, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Some cancer patients who take cholesterol-lowering statins may live longer than those not on these heart medications, a study from Britain suggests.

While it did not prove a cause-and-effect connection, the study of nearly 1 million cancer patients found that those taking statin drugs such as Lipitor and Crestor appeared to have:

a 22 percent lower risk of dying from lung cancer,

a 43 percent lower risk of dying from breast cancer,

a 47 percent lower risk of dying from prostate cancer,

and a 30 percent lower risk of dying from colon cancer.

""We need to further investigate the reasons for patients with high cholesterol having improved mortality in four of the most common cancers,"" said senior researcher Dr. Rahul Potluri, a clinical lecturer at Aston University School of Medicine in Birmingham.

Potluri cautioned, however, that this study can't prove that statins actually extended life in cancer patients.

At this time, people without high cholesterol should not be taking statins in the hope of warding off cancer or living longer with cancer, he said.

""People with high cholesterol should be taking statins to lower their cholesterol and reduce their cardiovascular risk,"" he said. ""We cannot, however, recommend statins for cancer prevention without a positive clinical trial.""

For the study, Potluri and colleagues collected data on nearly 1 million patients listed in a clinical database from January 2000 to March 2013. The database includes information on cancer and other medical conditions, including high cholesterol. Data on deaths was obtained from the U.K. Office for National Statistics.

Among the patients in the study, nearly 8,000 had lung cancer, 5,500 had breast cancer, 4,600 had prostate cancer and 4,500 had colon cancer, the researchers found.

After adjusting for factors that might play a role in dying, such as age, gender, ethnicity and common causes of death, the researchers found those taking statins lived longer than those who were not taking them.

The results were to be presented Friday at the European Society of Cardiology meeting in Florence, Italy. Research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

One expert doesn't think sufficient evidence exists yet to take statins to prevent or treat cancer.

""Regardless of whether or not a person has cancer, statin use should be discussed with a health care provider,"" said Eric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society.

""There is little evidence that statins affect cancer risk or survival, but clear evidence that they can help some people lower risk of heart attacks and strokes,"" he said.

"(Reuters) - U.S. health regulators said on Tuesday they approved a stent by Abbott Laboratories that is the first designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream after it is implanted.

The stent, called Absorb, is made of a plastic similar to dissolving sutures and offers patients an alternative to metal stents currently used to prop open arteries cleared of blockages.

Unlike traditional stents that remain in place after implantation, Absorb is designed to disappear fully within three years of the procedure.

Absorb’s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state, free from a permanent metal implant. The approach holds particular promise for patients whose coronary artery disease could require multiple implants over the course of several decades, said Mitchell Krucoff, a professor at Duke University Medical Center who has advised Abbott on Absorb.

“This is a game changer,” he said in an interview. “There are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery.”

Absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, which approved the stent, said.

“No metal means the treated artery can pulse and flex naturally as demands on the heart change with everyday activities,” said Gregg Stone of Columbia University Medical Center, who led clinical trials for Absorb. “No metal may also reduce the potential of future blockages that occur with permanent metallic stents.”

Data released in October concluded Absorb was comparable to Abbott’s own Xience drug-coated metal stent in safety and effectiveness but showed a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots. Abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it.

Absorb also will compete with Medtronic Plc’s traditional drug-coated Resolute stent and Boston Scientific Corp’s Synergy and Promus stents. Synergy’s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re-clogging, leaving a metal stent in place.

Abbott plans to roll out the device to about 100 hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales, said spokesman Jonathon Hamilton. Absorb will be priced at a “modest” premium to Xience, he said. Analysts have predicted Absorb will gain a market niche but not surpass drug-dispensing metal stents such as Xience in share until longer-term data show more favorable clinical results.",1
"When I tore my rotator cuff in 2008, I had conventional laparoscopic surgery to repair it. The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn’t let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again.

So in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again.

Cortisone injections and physical therapy didn’t help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body’s natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right.

It may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me.

[PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?]

Before undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis.

“[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,’’ says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. “There still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.’’

The procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient’s arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries.

“PRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,’’ says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. “It releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.’’

A recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function.

The researchers call the results “clinically relevant,’’ despite the study’s small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. “I’ve heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,” says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study’s authors. “The potential for benefit from PRP is real.’’

I had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder — the site of the tear — was considerably weaker than my right.

He then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier.

Before deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain.

I had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder — to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks.

After what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with.

Ferrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. “We want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,’’ Ferrell says.

Because there is not yet enough research on PRP — and because some studies have shown mixed results — insurance will not cover it.

Still, “it has significant cost savings” compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery.

With additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient’s own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons — which says PRP “holds great promise’’ — describes the risk as minimal.

Those who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience — someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month — and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says.

Moreover, “you see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,” he adds.

By February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job.

I had it on March 4.

When I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results. The tear was completely gone.",1
"When doctors who treat pregnant women recently met to debate the best time to induce labor, they came up with a surprising answer: 39 weeks — three weeks earlier than currently recommended.

Their organization, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG), has not changed its guidelines on late-term pregnancies. The guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at 41 weeks and should proceed with it at 42 weeks. But the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies.

The question was presented in May at the yearly ACOG meeting in Washington: “Why not induce everyone at 39 weeks?” Two doctors had been asked to debate: Errol Norwitz, chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine, and Charles Lockwood, dean of the Morsani College of Medicine at the University of South Florida.

[Here’s what’s being done to lower the maternal death rate]

“My original assumption when asked to participate in this debate,” Lockwood said, “was that Dr. Norwitz would take the ‘pro’ side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after 38 weeks, and I would take the ‘con’ side since older literature suggested that C-section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at 39 weeks.”

Charles J. Lockwood found studies suggesting that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce complications in mothers and infants. (University of South Florida)

Norwitz was a vigorous proponent. “There is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,” he told the doctors. And as Lockwood reviewed research, he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view.

“But Errol and I decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions,” Lockwood said. “Beyond adding an element of suspense, this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions.”

After Lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at 39 weeks decrease Caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications, what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction.

Before either doctor spoke, the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled: 63 percent opposed having most women deliver at 39 weeks, 20 percent supported it and 17 percent were unsure.

Norwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course.

“Nature is a terrible obstetrician,” he said, referring to the “continuum” of pregnancy and birth: the large number of zygotes that never implant, the 75 percent lost before 20 weeks, and stillbirth.

And, he said, the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after 39 weeks. “Stillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem,” he said. “There are anywhere between 25,000 to 30,000 stillbirths a year in the United States.”

“There is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond 39 weeks in well-dated pregnancies,” said Errol Norwitz, Chairman of the Department of Obstetrics and Gynecology at Tufts University School of Medicine. (Tufts Medical Center)

Lockwood and Norwitz’s support for induction at 39 weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session, it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby.

Labor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin, which can set off contractions. Labor can begin immediately or take a day or two; if it becomes too lengthy, Caesareans are performed.

Cristen Pascucci, an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions, thinks the doctors’ remarks suggest that all babies need to be “rescued by birth,” creating an anti-woman mentality. “It’s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design,” said Pascucci, a vice president of the advocacy group Improving Birth.

Pascucci, who is based in Lexington, Ky., travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights. She said the induction recommendation “reinforces a century-old, pre-feminist American obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor’s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator — like in the ’50s, when every baby was pulled out of its shackled, unconscious mother by episiotomy.”

Consumer groups such as hers, she said, have been calling on ACOG to evolve toward care that is more centered on women. “It’s disheartening to see how hard that’s going to be for some physicians to do.”

Lockwood and Norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at 39 weeks. “I think a lot of this gets very emotional,” Norwitz said.

Although both doctors support induction at 39 weeks for all healthy pregnancies, Lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn’t routinely adopt the practice just yet. As with any change in standard medical care, extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted. Even so, Norwitz thinks that “it’s a very healthy discussion to have.”

Due dates are calculated 40 weeks from the first day of a woman’s normal menstrual period and, according to ACOG, full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between 39 weeks and 40 weeks and six days.

As he prepared for the debate, Lockwood created a micro-simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions, and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth, Caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at 39 weeks. That prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction.

Still, he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion: 70 percent now supported the idea that women deliver at 39 weeks, 21 percent remained unsure and only 9 percent were against the idea.

[I didn’t understand the pressure to have a C-section until I was about to deliver]

Traditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a Caesarean. But Norwitz said the evidence doesn’t support that. Rather, he said, the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the Caesarean risk, adding a small caveat: For a small number of first-time mothers with “unfavorable, long and hard cervixes” — as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction — the risk of Caesarean is increased.

Rebecca Dekker, who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website Evidence Based Birth, which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals, watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed. She called it “concerning and rash” for doctors at the meeting to make “broad conclusions” that “could potentially affect at least 3 million women a year in the United States alone.”

Norwitz said that the presentations were evidence-based. “This is my interpretation of the published literature,” he said. “This is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology.”

Lockwood said he finds push-back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process.

Dekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of Caesarean delivery. For the women who waited for labor to start on its own, about half ended up being induced for medical complications. “They still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor, so it sways the results of the studies,” she said.

Dekker isn’t disputing that there are about 25,000 stillbirths per year or that this is a concern. However, she said a Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between 20 and 27 weeks of pregnancy, and the other half at later points.

“It’s obvious that a blanket policy of 39-week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before 39 weeks,” Dekker said, adding that the CDC report concludes, “Despite intensive investigations, for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined.”

And, Dekker said, the public has the misconception that inductions are simple, noninvasive procedures. Pitocin, the most commonly used drug for induction, is classified as a high-alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs. The drug can cause contractions that are too frequent, increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby, she said. Also, the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early, and it can cause the uterine wall to tear.

For Dekker, the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction.

There are clear philosophical differences. One early morning in his hospital’s labor and delivery unit, Norwitz said, he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest. “We midwives stand behind the patient, and if she gets off the path, we coax her back onto it,” she told him. “Obstetricians are in front of her, hacking through the forest.”

Esther Hausman, a certified nurse midwife in Concord, Mass., argues for restraint. “Since we don’t know exactly what triggers labor, why mess with it?”

Hausman suggested learning from countries such as Denmark or Sweden, where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the United States. In a 2014 CDC report, the U.S. infant mortality rate (6.1 per 1,000 births) put it in 26th place among a selection of developed countries. Finland and Japan had the lowest rates (2.3 per 1,000 births.)

Dekker said that the ACOG debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife-led care. Midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively, she said, and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more-satisfied patients.

Beverly Siegal, a retired obstetrician-gynecologist in Newton, Mass., attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction.

“What changed [my opinion] at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond 39 weeks,” Siegal said. “I would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at 39 weeks be encouraged to get induced.”

Of course, Lockwood said, women should be heard.

“Finally, needless to say, it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention,” he said.

“But obviously our messages — how you talk — does make a difference,” Norwitz said.",1
"A cure for Alzheimer's disease (AD), a condition marked by progressive, debilitating cognitive decline that affects more than 5.4 million Americans, is the holy grail in disease research. One expert, Dr. Dale Bredesen, a professor at the Buck Institute for Research on Aging and a professor at the Easton Laboratories for Neurodegenerative Disease Research at UCLA, thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss, a hallmark of the disease.

In a study published in the journal Aging, Bredesen and colleagues showed how 10 patients who were experiencing age-related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration (MEND), a 36-point individualized regimen of diet, exercise, brain stimulation, sleep improvements, medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to 24 months.

For example, an MRI of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the 17th percentile for his age range prior to MEND. (The hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in Alzheimer's patients.) After 10 months of following the prescribed protocol, his hippocampal volume increased to the 75th percentile.

The study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline, were able to return to work after adopting MEND and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance.

""Lives have been dramatically impacted,"" Bredesen told CBS News. ""I'm enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol.""

James E. Galvin, M.D., M.P.H., a professor of clinical biomedical science at FAU's Charles E. Schmidt College of Medicine and a professor in the Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing, who was not involved in the study, agreed that personalized approaches such as the MEND protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward. ""It's important to be excited about this approach,"" he told CBS News. However, Galvin cautioned, ""I'm not sure about the method.""

The MEND protocol, outlined in a 2014 study in the journal Aging, calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with Alzheimer's such as inflammation, stress and diabetes. However, MEND also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require FDA approval.

""Not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them,"" Galvin told CBS News.

But Bredesen believes that the only way to treat Alzheimer's is to treat all of the underlying problems, which may require intervention with supplements. ""Nutrition, exercise, sleep, stress reduction -- these are all critical pieces of this,"" he told CBS News. ""It's about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics, whatever it takes.""

But even if MEND is effective, the program is complex and difficult to follow. A Buck Institute press release on the study stated: ""None of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol. The significant diet and lifestyle changes, and multiple pills required each day, were the two most common complaints.""

Bredesen said that to simplify the program, they are connecting patients with health coaches. ""We're trying to make it simpler, but we don't want to lose the efficacy,"" he said.

Bredesen noted, too, that the MEND protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of Alzheimer's. One participant from the 2014 study, who had been diagnosed with late-stage Alzheimer's, did not show improvements with the protocol.

""If you told me that your mother is 86 and living in a home, I would say that I'd want to treat you,"" he said. ""It's about prevention.""

Bredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible.

Galvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported. ""This is moving in the right direction,"" he told CBS News. ""These anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion.""",1
"Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Photo illustration by Natalie Matthews-Ramo. Photos by Prudkov and Thinkstock.

It’s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids—the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds. New research out of Oxford helps confirm this and then some: The researchers’ meta-analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the 14 antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents.

The only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine, sold in the U.S. under the trade name Prozac. It outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability, a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects.

Prozac is also the only antidepressant approved by the Food and Drug Administration to treat depression in people under 18. That’s because the FDA has deemed that Prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens: disrupting brain development. Dr. Andrea Cipriani, psychiatrist and lead author on the study, says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily. “From a clinical point of view, we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain,” he said.

There’s good reason for this. Researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing. Back in 2004, researchers at Harvard Medical School released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals, including antidepressants, in adolescents. The study, which used rats in lieu of human children, found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain. Research on how antidepressants actually affect human children’s brain development is extremely hard to come by, given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them. But other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory—something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing.

And there’s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children: They may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior. Since 2004, the FDA has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under 24 due to the increased risk in suicidality, especially during the early phases of treatment. Dr. Mina Fazel, child psychiatrist at the Oxford University Children’s Hospital, says, “It’s complicated, because you’re giving antidepressants when you’re very worried about that young person’s mood.” Essentially, the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide. Untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers, though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide. So far, the FDA is erring on the side of caution.

A comment attached to the Oxford paper, written by Dr. Jon Jureidini, a child psychiatrist at the Women’s and Children’s Hospital in Adelaide, Australia, goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids. “Only if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed,” he writes. “For antidepressants in adolescents, this equation will rarely favor prescribing; in younger children, almost never.”

To be clear, Jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents. I called him to be sure. “They’re not better than nothing,” he said, “and there’s quite clear evidence that they’re more dangerous than nothing.” He arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice.

His wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids, Prozac included, is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don’t work well in children because they weren’t designed for children. They were designed for adults, and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents.

The Oxford paper notes that 3 percent of children ages 6-12 and nearly 6 percent of teenagers ages 13-18 suffered from major depressive disorder, the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression. Given the U.S. population, that works out to more than a million children and adolescents. The disease manifests differently in kids: Whereas adults might report feeling apathetic, unmotivated, unfocused, and just plain sad, children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers. That means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place. Of course, having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help.

If there’s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids, it’s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense, anyway. Guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy, or “talk therapy,” which is has been shown to work, at least by participants’ own assessment of their depression levels (it’s very hard to test therapy against a placebo, for obvious reasons). Methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy, in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns, and interpersonal therapy, which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships, seem to be equally effective in treating depression, particularly in adolescents. Of course, this is a high-cost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested, and it may not always be readily available—but the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful.

Like in nearly all areas of science, biomedical or otherwise, our understanding is limited, and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options. Adolescent depression is particularly difficult, since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults. If we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients (critical, because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation), we need more data.",1
"A Scientist's Dream Fulfilled: Harnessing The Immune System To Fight Cancer

Enlarge this image toggle caption Scott Dalton for NPR Scott Dalton for NPR

Sharon Belvin's nightmare with cancer began in 2004, when she was just 22.

Belvin was an avid runner but said she suddenly found she couldn't climb the stairs without ""a lot of difficulty breathing.""

Eventually, after months of fruitless treatments for lung ailments like bronchitis, she was diagnosed with melanoma — a very serious skin cancer. It had already spread to her lungs, and the prognosis was grim. She had about a 50-50 chance of surviving the next six months.

""Yeah, that was the turning point of life, right there,"" she says.

What Belvin didn't know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials. An immunologist named Jim Allison, now at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right, it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments. (Joe Palca worked for Allison early in both men's careers.)

Allison's treatment was still experimental, but if it worked, it had the potential to save Belvin's life.

""It's a new modality for treating cancer,"" Dr. Samuel Broder, a former director of the National Cancer Institute, says now of Allison's pioneering research. ""It used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer — surgery, radiation and chemotherapy — or some combination of those three. It's fair to say there's now a fourth option.""

Allison's long search for this new kind of treatment — one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients — began around a decade before Belvin got sick, when Allison was running a lab at the University of California, Berkeley.

At the time, he was what you could call a research scientist's research scientist. He was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system — T cells. A subset of white blood cells, T cells travel around the body and can ""protect us against just about anything,"" Allison says.

T cells do recognize cancer cells, but not in a way that can eliminate the disease. Allison had been studying T cells for years, and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells, he could enhance their response to cancer, enough to eradicate the illness.

He and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked T cells on cancerous tumors in mice, and the initial results astounded them. The T cells seemed to be doing just what Allison had hoped they would do — shrink the tumors and kill the cancer.

Allison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break. After a few tense days, the tumors again disappeared.

""These mice were cured,"" Allison says.

Cancer cured?

""I've been doing this sort of stuff for years, and I'd never seen anything like that,"" Allison says. ""And I thought, 'If we could do that in people, this is going to be amazing.' ""

Allison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice. He thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach.

But the biotech companies he met with didn't bite. In those days, most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly, and Allison was asking them to try something very different.

""This was targeting the immune system, not the cancer,"" he says. ""We weren't trying to kill the cancer cells. We were letting the T cells kill the cancer cells.""

Thanks, but no thanks, the companies told him.

""I got very depressed,"" Allison says. He was sure this was the most important work of his career, but he had to get others on board.

Eventually, a scientist attending one of Allison's research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm Medarex. The company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of Allison's therapy, and was willing to give it a try.

It took a decade, but eventually Allison's big idea was ready for testing in people. A clinical trial to study the drug — now called ipilimumab, or Ippy for short — was set up at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City.

Allison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy, so he packed up his California lab and moved it to Sloan Kettering.

As it happens, Belvin was also in New York — a patient of Dr. Jedd Wolchok at Sloan Kettering. By the fall of 2004, Belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her. Nothing had worked to control the melanoma; it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body.

Belvin remembers feeling sick and depressed, and says she wasn't even paying much attention when Wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment.

""Sharon, we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here. It's something you should consider,"" Wolchok told her.

Belvin says she signed up without hesitation. After just four injections of Ippy across three months, her cancer was nearly gone. And at Belvin's follow-up appointment a year later, Wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in: ""Sharon, you no longer have cancer.""

And in the next breath, Belvin recalls, ""he goes, 'Oh, the guy who invented this is upstairs. Do you want to meet him?' ""

""Yes, of course I want to meet him!"" she told her doctor.

Wolchok called Allison, who was working nearby, and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic — a part of the hospital Allison had rarely seen. Though the research scientist couldn't imagine why Wolchok was in such a rush, he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by Belvin with a huge hug.

Belvin says she tried not to tackle him. ""It was hard to control myself,"" she says. ""I owe this man my life.""

Belvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that Allison had ever met. ""It really meant a lot,"" he says. ""It reminded me what it's all about at the end of the day.""

That was in 2005; today, Sharon Belvin is still cancer-free.

Ippy is now sold under the brand name Yervoy by Bristol-Myers Squibb, which bought Medarex in 2009.

Meanwhile, Jim Allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world. Among other honors, he was a 2015 recipient of the prestigious Lasker Award for his achievements in medical science.

He's become well-known among patients, too. Now and again, Allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease.

Allison can't really answer them. Each case is different, and using a patient's own cells to destroy tumors won't work in every patient or in every type of cancer. Still, the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can't, and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment.

It might be too early to say we're going to cure cancer, Allison says, ""but we're going to cure certain types of cancers. We've got a shot at it now.""",1
"When it comes to health, I’m skeptical of willpower. Sure, I talk to my students about personal responsibility, but when it comes to the health of populations, I look for big fixes more than for small acts of will.

That’s why my ears perked up when I heard that two old physician friends had decided to start taking, as a preventive measure, some of the medications often included in what the field has dubbed the “polypill.” My friends are both top doctors in their 60s, with good diet and lifestyle, and this is now part of their personal health regimen.

A polypill might include any of several things: a baby aspirin, a statin to rebalance cholesterol, a drug to control blood pressure and one to lower blood sugar. (A version less comprehensive than this is available online with a doctor’s prescription at Polypill.com.) Whatever the combination, the doses are low, so it’s relatively safe. It’s like a multivitamin, but with serious medications. Some public-health advocates now argue that everyone over 50 should be on one.

You read that right: everyone. If we had perfectly healthy lifestyles, these drugs would not be needed, but we don’t. And even if we did, the drugs might add further protection.

One review of the research on polypills comes from Melvin Lafeber and his colleagues at the University Medical Center Utrecht (Netherlands). Writing in Current Hypertension Reports in April, they found reason to think that treatment might help higher-risk individuals and urged more clinical trials. If moderate- and high-risk people benefit, “the idea of offering treatment to everybody older than 50 years might raise widespread interest,” they wrote. The polypill, they concluded, “could be an important tool to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease” and make it more likely that patients take the necessary drugs.

Critics worry about medicalizing whole populations, predicting that the pill would encourage bad habits and worsen health disparities. A fixed-dose combination pill is one-size-fits-all, which doctors don’t usually regard as the best medicine. But polypills might solve real problems. The drugs in them are cheap and target illnesses that afflict many millions around the world, and even patients with tailored prescriptions often fail to keep up with the various medicines.

Some of the component drugs are now being evaluated for use with lower-risk populations—that is, people who don’t already have serious problems with their blood pressure, blood sugar or cholesterol. Though not a polypill experiment per se, a study published in May in the New England Journal of Medicine involved 12,000 people over five years. One group got two drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol, the other got placebos. In the group taking both drugs, 3.6% died or had health crises; in the placebo group, 5% did. The doses were low, so the adverse effects were modest.

This doesn’t mean that we should all be on the polypill, but some sensible experts, including my two doctor friends, are moving toward this sort of preventive approach for people who aren’t ill or at high risk. After all, many of us are already taking low-dose aspirin, which is possibly the riskiest of these drugs.

I tend to favor this sort of blunt, comprehensive approach to public health. Much as I like menacing cigarette-package warnings, urging personal responsibility, I like cigarette taxes more (despite their regressive impact). I love “Drive Carefully” signs, but I like seat belts better. And I like air bags best: No judgment, no decision, no defiant will. As for driving under the influence, breathalyzer tests and taking keys away beat the heck out of admonitions to be sober and find a designated driver.

Human nature is not our ally in maintaining health. With heart disease and stroke, many millions of lives are at stake, and for me it comes down to this: Will popping a polypill work better than willpower? I suspect that the answer may turn out to be yes.",0
"Patients will potentially be able to avoid medications that do not help them and the test could start a ‘new era’ for personalised treatment of depression

Scientists have developed a blood test that could identify which people with depression will respond to treatment so that patients can avoid spending months taking antidepressants that do not help them.

The experts involved believe the breakthrough could lead to depressed patients receiving personalised treatments that are more likely to relieve their symptoms.

The Royal College of Psychiatrists said that, if it worked, the test could prove to be a key moment in the quest for the holy grail of biological psychiatry.

The scientists at King’s College London behind the development claim that their test “accurately and reliably predicts whether depressed patients will respond to common antidepressants, which could herald a new era of personalised treatment for people with depression”.

If the test proves effective it is hoped that by measuring patients’ level of blood inflammation it would identify which of them would benefit from receiving antidepressants soon after their diagnosis to stop their condition worsening.

What does depression feel like? Trust me – you really don’t want to know | Tim Lott Read more

About half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people.

Currently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants, or combinations of them. That means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for 12 weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them.

One in six Britons will suffer depression at some point in their life. Last year 61.5m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in England.

Researchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood, as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants. They found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants. Their findings have been reported in the International Journal of Neuropsychopharmacology.

“The identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients,” said Prof Carmine Pariante from KCL’s institute of psychiatry, psychology and neuroscience.

“This study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy. Patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies, including the addition of other antidepressants or anti-inflammatory drugs,” Pariante added.

Dr Cosmo Hallstrom, a spokesman for the Royal College of Psychiatrists, said: “Finding biological markers for depression (and other mental illnesses) has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry.

“Such a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression. It would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient.”

But further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting, Hallstrom added.

Stephen Buckley, head of information at the mental health charity Mind, said: “We welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems. These initial findings are interesting, but, as with all areas of mental health, there is still more research to be done.”

Mental health problems, including depression, are estimated to cost £105bn a year in England. The World Health Organisation has predicted that by 2020 depression will be the second biggest cause of health problems in the world.",1
"About 800,000 people in the United States suffer from a stroke each year. Of those who survive, about 70 percent will be left disabled, making the cardiac event a major cause of adult disability. While there are therapies to help improve patients' mobility, they’re only effective within the first few hours of an event.

Recently, researchers from the Stanford University School of Medicine have made it their mission to improve these outcomes. They hypothesized that injecting stem cells into the brains of chronic stroke patients would increase their survival rates. And in a clinical trial testing the technique, researchers found injections can safely improve patients' motor function.

“What surprised us most was the remarkable recovery some patients had,” Dr. Gary Steinberg, professor and chair of neurosurgery at Stanford, told Medical Daily, “While we had hoped for that, we didn’t really expect it. Patients recover from strokes over the first six months, and then there’s very little recovery [after that]. You know, they go to rehab and there’s not much more [more] they can recover usually.”

For the study, Steinberg and his team recruited 18 patients who had suffered their first and only stroke six months to three years prior to the trial. Each patient had a small hole drilled through their skulls in order for researchers to be able to inject stem cells taken from the bone marrow of two donors directly into parts of their brains that were damaged from stroke. After patients were sent home, researchers continued to monitor their health through blood tests, clinical evaluations, and brain imaging.

Results showed that the implanted stem cells didn’t survive very long in the brain, disappearing about one to two months after injections; however, patients still showed significant motor recovery at six and 12 months post-surgery. Some of the patients bound to wheelchairs were even able to walk again.

“The recovery some patients showed was not just minimal, it was significant,” said Steinberg, who has researched stem cell therapies for more than 15 years. “It wasn’t just someone who couldn’t move their thumb now being able to move their thumb, [it was more profound than that].""

The types of stem cells used, called mesenchymal stem cells, can differentiate into a variety of cell types. In other words, they are the precursors to muscle, fat, bone, and tendon tissue. Past research has shown that these cells can be used to treat the effects of hypoxic-ischemic encephalopathy, brain damage caused by loss of oxygen.

In Steinberg's study, it did not “cause problems by differentiating into unwanted tissues or forming tumors.” And even when the stem cells came from an unrelated donor, the participants did not experience a strong immune reaction. Although more than 75 percent of patients reported suffering headaches afterward, the researchers said it was probably due to the surgical procedure rather than the stem cells themselves. Furthermore, there were no life-threatening effects linked to the procedure used to administer them.

Motor improvement was also independent of the severity of the stroke patients’ conditions— an important detail considering older adults tend to respond less to treatment, the researchers said.

In addition to setting the stage for an expanded trial of the procedure, the promising results also change “our notion of what happens after a stroke,” Steinberg explained. The findings suggest that stroke-damaged areas of the brain, once thought to be dead or irreversible, can actually be “resurrected.”

"(Reuters) - Dermira Inc said its experimental topical therapy for excessive underarm sweating was successful in two late-stage studies, bringing it one step closer to providing an easy-to-use therapy for the often embarrassing condition.

While the function of sweating is to prevent overheating, those affected sweat even when the body does not need cooling.

Existing therapies for excessive underarm sweating, also called axillary hyperhidrosis, offer limited effectiveness and can be expensive.

The first line of defense are anti-perspirants. Next, patients can try costlier alternatives such as botox injections, a device called miraDry that delivers electromagnetic energy to decompose sweat glands, or laser therapy to destroy them.

Sufferers can also opt for localized surgery, like liposuction, to remove or injure sweat glands. Oral medicines can be used to systemically limit sweating. For instance, a class of drugs called anticholinergics are commonly used off-label for this purpose, but they are linked with the risk of dementia.

Based on the most recent estimates, about 7.8 million Americans have some form of excessive sweating including palms, feet, underarms or head, and about half of this population suffer from the underarm form, said Dermira spokeswoman Erica Jefferson, in an interview ahead of the data readout.

The Menlo Park, California-based company’s shares were up 3 percent at $33.00 in extended trading on Wednesday.

About two-thirds of the total 697 enrolled in the two trials for the company’s topical treatment, DRM04, were treated with wipes containing DRM04, while the rest were not.

In the first trial, a significant improvement in the severity of sweating was seen in 52.8 percent of the patients treated with the drug, compared with 28.3 percent patients in the control group, on a scale designed by the company.

In the second trial, a significant improvement was seen in 66.1 percent of the drug-treated patients, compared with 26.9 percent in the control group.

Dermira said it had expected to apply for marketing approval for the drug in the second half of 2017, subject to completion of the drug’s long-term safety trial.",1
"Scientists have raised the possibility of using statins – drugs used for reducing cholesterol – to stop some breast cancer tumours returning.

The most common form of breast cancer uses oestrogen to grow. Drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen, reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery. But about 12,000 of the 40,000 diagnosed oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) cancers still recur every year.

Study points toward personalised treatment for breast cancer Read more

Early research – most of it still in the lab – published in the journal Breast Cancer Research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). It can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow.

Dr Lesley-Ann Martin at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where the research has been carried out, said: “During the course of treatment, ER-positive breast cancers, that are ‘fed’ by oestrogen, often become resistant to standard hormone therapy. Our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it.

“This is hugely significant. Testing the patient’s tumour for 25-HC or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy, and tailor their treatment accordingly. Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials.”

The research has not yet been tested in humans. The scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel, in the form of the cholesterol molecule. They then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells’ growth by between 30% and 50%.

The scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over-activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti-cancer drugs.

Cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings.

Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, which funded the research, said: “This is a really crucial discovery. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today’s most commonly used treatments.

“This study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments. But this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach.”

Another charity, Breast Cancer Care, said the research was promising but needed further trials. “This early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterol-reducing treatment, such as statins, could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy,” said Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist.

“We know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment. This discovery may, in future, help reduce these concerns for some patients, by allowing doctors to test if their cancer is likely to return, and tailor treatment accordingly.”",1
"For 6.7 million American women of child-bearing age, getting pregnant is not an easy task. Specialists now have a way to test the parents-to-be that may not only increase their chances of getting pregnant but also reduce the risk of them passing on certain genetic diseases.

“When we do pre-implantation genetic screening, we can ensure that the embryos are chromosomally normal before transferring them back to the intended mother’s uterus, and that increases the likelihood of implantation,” Dr. Jared Robbins, an associated professor in obstetrics and gynecology-reproductive endo & infertility at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, told Fox News.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), birth defects caused by genetic disorders affect one in every 33 births in the United States.

The test results may limit the chances of an embryo carrying a chromosomal disorder from being implanted.

“We can’t fix the embryos yet, but we can determine which embryos are affected by the disease and which aren’t and only transfer back those that are not affected,” Robbins, who is also a fertility doctor at Northwestern Memorial Hospital, said.

A diagnosis before pregnancy may sound like a designer baby, but doctors say that’s not the case.

“We have the technology and ability to eradicate diseases that have ravaged families for decades,” Dr. Kaylen Silverberg, of Texas Fertility Center, told Fox News. “They’ve lost family members generation after generation after generation, or they’ve had family members who’ve suffered from chronic disease that’s totally preventable.”

These procedures not only help limit the passing on of diseases— they may also help couples get pregnant faster.

“We’re getting significantly higher pregnancy rates, significantly lower miscarriage rates,” Silverberg said.

These results have helped eliminate pre-term birth and hospitalizations for pre-term labor, and patients and families have better outcomes, he added.

Pre-implantation genetic screening doesn’t necessarily get patients pregnant unless they have good embryos, Robbins noted.

“All it does is allow us to choose the best embryos to transfer so that we can get the patients pregnant faster,” he said.

Experts say the couples are not the only people who benefit from these tests. The results may help family members who are trying to get pregnant make decisions as well.",1
"An experimental procedure aimed at repairing spinal cord injuries is showing promise. It uses stem cells in the damaged areas in hopes of restoring function and movement.

And for one patient, it is promising.

On April 9, 2013, James Mason was an accident waiting to happen.

""There was nothing we could have done to change that night,"" said Bob Gambuti.

During an argument, James Mason's stepfather Bob Gambuti, tried to stop him from getting into a car after Mason had been drinking.

""He grabbed onto me, I grabbed onto him,"" said Gambuti. ""He pulled my leg out and we fell back and his neck broke.""

""I remember just hitting the ground,"" said Mason. ""I remember the whole way with the stretcher.""

Gambuti said the most devastating part of the whole process was the first day that they lifted Mason out of a bed.

""And nothing moved,"" Gambuti said. ""Just his head. That really hit hard. At that point I really wanted to go jump off a bridge.""

Mason was left a quadriplegic, with just the slightest ability to move his arms. Doctors said he would never walk again.

Gambuti, a retired cop, became his full time caregiver and found an experimental trial at New York's Mount Sinai Hospital.

CBS News spoke with Mason just before he underwent delicate neck surgery to try and repair the demaged part of his spinal cord by injecting stem cells.

""I'm just super excited, ready to just get it done and go back to rehab and start proving the doctors wrong even more,"" said Mason.

The surgery performed by Dr. Arthur Jenkins, took four hours. Researchers have followed Mason and five other patients -- all with the most severe spinal cord injuries.

CBS News met up with Mason again three months after the surgery.

Mason said he was already noticing changes.

""My wrist has gotten a lot stronger. I'm able to grasp around a lot other things,"" he said.

And after six months, he was noticing changes then, too.

""I think it's almost doubled with how much I've gotten better,"" he said. ""And got sensation back into my feet. I can feel pressure onto 'em, throughout my legs. And they've noticed that I have a little bit of movement into my hips now.""

Today, the company sponsoring the trial reported four of the six patients experienced improvement in both motor strength and function. Dr. Jenkins, who is not affiliated with the company, has continued to monitor Mason.

""My two cents is it worked, that this actually changed his neurological recovery and function,"" Dr. Jenkins said. ""That his actual functional improvement is from the stem cells that were injected.""

What's that like for Mason?

""I mean, I just have to keep pushing forward,"" he said.

Mason does not blame his stepfather for the accident, in fact, he is grateful.

""If I had gotten into my car, I could have killed someone else, someone's mother, someone's father, someone's child. If I would have survived through that, I wouldn't have been able to live with myself,"" he said.

""It's odd and it's tough and people say, 'I'm sorry.' Don't be sorry. I still have him here,"" Gambuti said.

Mason believes the stem cells accelerated his recovery. But it's hard to know what would have happened without them. More research will be needed to try to establish whether they actually repair damage to the spinal cord.",1
"Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult and Aberdeen University are working on lab-grown treatment that could help hundreds of thousands of people

Insulin shots could become a thing of the past for type 1 diabetes patients thanks to a technology being developed by Cell and Gene Therapy Catapult, a London-based not-for-profit organisation, and Aberdeen University.

The pre-clinical results have encouraged CGT and Aberdeen University to create a spin-out company, called Islexa. It will manufacture lab-grown islets, the organoids responsible for insulin production, by reprogramming donated pancreatic tissue.

Only 30-50 people with type 1 diabetes in the UK currently receive an islet transplant each year, owing to a lack of donors and the difficulty of extracting islets from pancreatic tissue.

Growing islets will “significantly increase the number of patients who can receive the treatment,” Keith Thompson, CGT’s chief executive, told the World Stem Cells and Regenerative Medicine congress in London on Wednesday. He will run Islexa with Michael Bennet from CGT and Anne Lewendon from Aberdeen University.



If clinical trials are successful, the technology means tens of thousands more people could live without the need for frequent insulin injections, although it will take a few years until the treatment is available.

About 320,000 people in Britain have type 1 diabetes, a number set to more than double to 652,000 by 2035. Around the world, 21 million people have type 1 diabetes.

It is a lifelong condition that occurs when the pancreas does not produce any insulin, while type 2 diabetes – far more common, especially as obesity rises around the world – is a condition where the pancreas does not produce enough insulin or the body’s cells do not react to it.

Prof Kevin Docherty, from Aberdeen University, said: “Donated islets are already effectively treating severe cases of type 1 diabetes. Having a hugely expanded supply of lab-grown islets will enable us to significantly extend this established clinical treatment.”

CGT was set up in 2012 and is based on the 12th floor of Guy’s hospital in London. It employs more than 100 people and has government backing through Innovate UK but also gets private funding through partnerships. It is building a £55m cell therapy manufacturing centre in Stevenage. Islexa will use CGT’s labs at Guy’s and facilities at Aberdeen University.

They are looking for investors to take Islexa all the way as a fully fledged external company. The promising early results have given them the confidence to form a wider consortium with the Scottish Islet Transplant Programme, the University of Edinburgh and the Scottish National Blood Transfusion Service.



John Casey, consultant transplant surgeon at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh and lead clinician for the islet transplantation programme in Scotland, said: “Islet transplantation can transform the lives of patients with type 1 diabetes, and in some cases can result in long-term freedom from insulin injections with excellent glucose control.”",1
"(Reuters) - Tiny Israeli drugmaker Oramed Pharmaceuticals Inc on Wednesday said its experimental oral insulin succeeded in significantly reducing night-time blood glucose in patients with type 2 diabetes, according to initial data from a midstage trial.

Nadav Kidron, CEO of Oramed Pharmaceuticals, shows an insulin pill as he poses for a photo at the company's offices in Jerusalem September 29, 2013. REUTERS/Baz Ratner

The result is likely to surprise many skeptics who did not believe insulin could be delivered orally because they doubted it could survive the onslaught of digestive juices so it could have the intended effect.

Oramed uses a protective coating and a high-enough dose of insulin so that most of it can be destroyed and still deliver a clinically beneficial amount of the hormone.

The positive results must be replicated in a larger Phase III trial before the drug, known as ORMD-0801, can be submitted for approval. But the data from the Phase II, 180-patient trial represents a major milestone.

“It’s been a long trip but it’s finally at the point that it’s beyond a doubt, the oral insulin works,” Nadav Kidron, chief executive of Jerusalem-based Oramed, said in a telephone interview.

The 28-day study involved patients whose type 2 diabetes was not adequately controlled by metformin. They were dosed before bed time and had their overnight glucose levels continuously monitored. Those who received the oral insulin had a mean night-time glucose reduction of nearly 6.5 percent compared with a placebo.

There were no reported serious adverse side effects and no issues with hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, the company said. Oramed said it plans to publish more detailed data from the study once it has had time to analyze the full results.

While insulin is typically associated with type 1 diabetes, many patients with type 2 eventually see their disease progress to the point where they need insulin. Type 2 accounts for more than 90 percent of the nearly 400 million people with diabetes worldwide.

A safe and effective oral insulin, if approved, is expected to become a multibillion-dollar product.

The main attraction of an insulin pill, aside from avoiding injections, is that it comes much closer to the path of natural insulin, which is produced in the pancreas and goes directly to the liver. ORMD-0801 goes from the gut to the liver, while injected insulin circulates throughout the body before it gets there.

Some doctors believe high levels of insulin circulating through the rest of the body may increase health risks.",1
"LONDON, May 17 (Reuters) - Psilocybin, the psychedelic compound in magic mushrooms, may one day be an effective treatment for patients with severe depression who fail to recover using other therapies, scientists said on Tuesday.

A small-scale pilot study of psilocybin’s use in cases of treatment-resistant depression showed it was safe and effective, the British researchers said.

Of 12 patients given the drug, all showed some decrease in symptoms of depression for at least three weeks. Seven continued to show a positive response at three months. Five remained in remission beyond the three months.

Robin Carhart-Harris, who led the study at Imperial College London’s department of medicine, said the results, published in the Lancet Psychiatry journal, were striking.

Many patients described a profound experience, he said, and appeared to undergo a shift in the way they perceived the world.

“But we shouldn’t get carried away with these results,” he told reporters at a briefing in London. “This isn’t a magic bullet. We’re just learning how to do this treatment.”

Magic mushrooms grow worldwide and have been used since ancient times, both for recreation and for religious rites.

British researchers led by David Nutt, a professor of neuropsychopharmacology at Imperial, have been exploring the potential of psilocybin to ease severe forms of depression in people who don’t respond to other treatments.

The World Health Organization estimates that some 350 million people worldwide are affected by depression, a common mental disorder characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, tiredness, feelings of guilt or low self-worth, disturbed sleep and appetite, and poor concentration.

Many patients respond to treatment with anti depressants and cognitive behavioral therapy, but around 20 percent don’t get better and are classed as having treatment-resistant depression.

Psilocybin acts on the serotonin system, suggesting it could be developed for treating depression. But hallucinogenic drugs can also cause unpleasant reactions, including anxiety and paranoia, so Nutt’s team wanted to find out if psilocybin can be given safely.

The trial involved six men and six women, aged between 30 and 64, all diagnosed with treatment-resistant depression. They all went through a full screening process before being allowed to participate and they were fully supported before, during and after they received psilocybin.

The patients were given psilocybin capsules during two dosing sessions, seven days apart.

Blood pressure, heart rate and the self-reported intensity of the effects of psilocybin were monitored during each session, and the patients were seen by a psychiatrist the next day and one, two, three and five weeks after the second dose.

Carhart-Harris said no serious side effects were reported during the study, although all volunteers said they were slightly anxious before and during initial drug administration.

“Psychedelic drugs have potent psychological effects and are only given in our research when appropriate safeguards are in place,” he said. “I wouldn’t want members of the public thinking they can treat their own depressions by picking their own magic mushrooms. That kind of approach could be risky.”

Nutt said the results showed that psilocybin “is safe and fast acting, so may - if administered carefully - have value for these patients.”",1
"Reviving Memory With An Electrical Current

Last year, in an operating room at the University of Toronto, a 63-year-old woman with Alzheimer's disease experienced something she hadn't for 55 years: a memory of her 8-year-old self playing with her siblings on their family farm in Scotland.



The woman is a patient of Dr. Andres Lozano, a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat Alzheimer's and other forms of dementia. If the approach pans out, it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories.

Right now, deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat Parkinson's disease and tremor, for which it's approved by the Food and Drug Administration. DBS involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes. The technique is also approved for obsessive-compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders, including depression, chronic pain and, as in Lozano's work, dementia.

In 2008, Lozano's group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus. Though no bigger than a pea, the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control, sleep and circadian rhythms. It seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger. To the researcher's surprise, following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu. He also perceived feeling 20 years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends, including an old girlfriend. With increasing voltages, his memories became more vivid, including remembering their clothes.

Using a 3-dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low-resolution brain electromagnetic tomography, or sLORETA, Lozano's group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings. They found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus, a key cog in the brain's memory circuitry. As Alzheimer's progresses, not only does the hypothalamus atrophy, but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired.

That our memories — so entwined with our personalities and senses of self — might be so vulnerable to a brown out is, existentially speaking, rather alarming. There's something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons, and also about retrieving memories by hot-wiring the brain.

Yet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing. Given that Alzheimer's affects 1 in 9 people over the age of 65 and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective, Lozano felt all but obligated to dig further. His group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the Annals of Neurology in 2010.

The study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for 1 year. ""The fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus,"" explains Lozano. ""It's easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function."" As expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate, however it appeared that in those with mild disease, cognitive decline slowed with stimulation.

Next, Lozano launched a randomized trial involving 42 patients from the US and Canada, all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain. In half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away. In the other half the stimulation wasn't turned on for a year, though they didn't know it.

Preliminary results, published in December 2015 in the Journal of Neurosurgery, were mixed but encouraging.

Given that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits, perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and DBS of the fornix appear safe. No serious long-term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group, supporting future research in the field.

In terms of efficacy, however, after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups, as measured by two scales commonly used to measure Alzheimer's disease symptoms, the ADAS-Cog and CDR-SB. Alzheimer's tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable. Lozano's final results won't be reported until four years out.

More intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization. Glucose is our brains' primary fuel. The degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity. Patients with Alzheimer's typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains, as well as, again, shrinking memory circuits. The older patients in Lozano's study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain's memory regions. Not only that, the hippocampus of some study patients who received DBS actually increased in size.

Reversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in Alzheimer's research, and Lozano's finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that DBS in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus.

Lozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories, which he says has occurred in about one-third of his patents — requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on. Yet he's encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe. ""We also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain,"" he says, a finding that could mean there's a way to overcome some of the damage from Alzheimer's.

Evidence supporting DBS in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well. A 2012 study published in the New England Journal of Medicine reported that in seven patients receiving DBS to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex, spatial memory improved – meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks. The entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories.

A group at the University of Cologne in Germany is instead focusing on delivering DBS to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of Meynert, another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to Alzheimer's. Last year they published a study in Molecular Psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to DBS, as measured by the ADAS-cog. Like in Lozano's study no serious side effects were seen.

Despite the mounting evidence for DBS, not everyone is convinced.

Referring to Lozano's second clinical study, Dr. Nader Pouratian, a neurosurgeon and DBS researcher at UCLA, comments, ""The recent deep brain stimulation trial for Alzheimer's disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease. Unfortunately, [the findings] suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed.""

However he acknowledges Lozano's results suggest that DBS to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients, those being older people with less severe disease.

""The most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area,"" he says. ""But I believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial.""

In a 2008 episode of the medical television drama House, the show's main character Dr. Gregory House survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky. In an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim – and inspired by Lozano's initial paper — House voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation. Following the procedure the grouchy TV doctor's memory returns. As is customary on the show, he cracks the case.

DBS for treatment of Alzheimer's and other dementias is a field in its infancy. Unlike on TV, in all likelihood it won't be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories. ""Even though House did this, we're not doing it yet,"" cautions Lozano.

Yet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections – albeit random ones – and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further.

""We're hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition,"" says Lozano. ""We want to turn these brain networks back on.""

"NEW YORK -- Debbie Spina is a supervisor for the radiology department at the Hospital for Joint Diseases at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. But when CBS News met her this spring, she was a patient who was about to undergo same-day hip replacement surgery.

The 61-year-old had been having hip pain for the past two years because of arthritis. She had heard a lot of positive feedback from people who had undergone hip replacement surgery at her hospital. A big attraction for her was the possibility of going home right after the surgery.

""The option to go home the same day and have that family around me was something that I wanted to do,"" said Spina.

She believed she would be able to recuperate more comfortably at home and get back on her feet faster.

At most hospitals, hip replacement patients can expect a one- to three-night hospital stay. Total hip replacement surgery is increasingly common, with more than 300,000 procedures done every year in the U.S. The surgery is meant to restore range of motion and help relieve arthritic pain. The procedure consists of removing the patient's worn out ball and socket joint and inserting an artificial socket. On the femur side, a stem is inserted into the bone and a ball is on the tip of it.

NYU Langone Medical Center said it became the first academic medical center in New York City to implement a same-day hip replacement program, in 2015.

Dr. Roy Davidovitch, director of NYU Langone's Hip Center, said he performs around 400 hip replacements a year and approximately 40 percent of those patients will go home the same day.

Davidovitch said patients are happier going home sooner. ""Nothing beats the comfort of your own home for recovery. And to be quite honest, if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital. It really doesn't make sense.""

There are two common surgical approaches for a total hip replacement: anterior, which involves entering surgically through the front of the hip, and posterior, or entering surgically through the side or buttocks.

According to research done by the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, there are no significant differences between either approach in recovery outcomes six months after surgery.

Davidovitch favors the anterior approach, which he believes has a faster and less painful recovery period in the short term because doctors don't have to cut through muscles or tendons to get to the hip like in the posterior approach. He does agree that in the long term, both procedures have the same outcomes for patients.

The anterior approach to hip replacement may result in a quicker short-term recovery, but over the long run patients' outcomes are the same. CBS News

But it's not the surgical approach alone that allows some of his patients to go home the same day -- it's a combination of what happens before, during and after surgery.

At NYU Langone patients have to do what's called pre-hab. Before the surgery they work with an occupational and physical therapist to learn information on the procedure, learn exercises to do after the surgery and how to properly move around while they are recovering.

During the surgery, Davidovitch uses a short-acting spinal anesthetic that lasts about 2 ½ hours, and when closing the wound he injects ""a cocktail of medications"" to help with the inflammation and pain.

Patients can be up and walking usually within three hours after the surgery.

But they must have someone around the first night they are spending at home post-surgery.

""The people who are against the whole idea for same-day discharge for hip replacement are concerned about the very rare instances where somebody could develop a blood clot that goes to the lung, or a fracture of some sort,"" said Davidovitch. ""The rates of blood clots or pulmonary emboli is exceedingly low. And in general, if a patient is identified as a high risk or a higher risk we don't send them home the same day.""

Davidovitch makes it clear that this kind of surgery is not one-size-fits-all. Patients are screened first to make sure they don't have risk factors like obesity, chronic liver disease or cardiac problems. Those who have risk factors must plan on staying overnight in the hospital, not going right home.

However, not every surgeon is embracing the same-day trend. Douglas E. Padgett, M.D., chief of the joint replacement service at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York, is a lot more conservative about who he believes is the optimal patient for going home the same day.

""The number of patients that are going home at this point in time in our institution is somewhere between one and two percent. So it's a relatively small percentage of patients that are going directly home,"" said Padgett.

Padgett has seen an increase in the number of hip replacement patients and a decrease in their age -- some are as young as their 40s and 50s. He said his department performs the most hip replacements of any institution in the U.S., doing about 5,000 a year. While he is not against patients going home the same day, he cautions that total joint replacement is a major procedure and doctors need to be careful to avoid sending patients home too soon.

""While I recognize there is no place like home, should there be the need for urgent or medical care the question is will that be available to the patient when they're in the setting of their own home,"" Padgett said.

Debbie Spina met all the requirements to go home the same day. Her surgery lasted about an hour, which is the average time for her type of procedure. After the the operation she was able to move around but felt dizzy and nauseous. The occupational and physical therapists waited until evening to try and get her to go up and down steps and walk around, which patients must be able to do before they are discharged. But Spina didn't feel well enough, so she actually ended up spending the night.

Even though her same-day discharge didn't go as planned, Spina felt good the following morning and was able to do her exercises and leave the hospital.

After her recovery is complete, she has a few goals she'd like to reach. ""I had walked prior to this four miles every morning -- I'd like to do that. And I'd like to improve my golf game if possible,"" Spina said while smiling.

Davidovitch's goal is for patients to return to their normal level of activity as quickly as possible. And with many people wanting to maintain active lifestyles well into their 70s and beyond, he expects to see even greater demand for hip replacement surgery and the same-day option. ""In general I see this growing to about 60 percent of my practice,"" he said.",1
"Does Putting On A Few Pounds Help You Cheat Death?

Enlarge this image toggle caption Kris Hanke/Getty Images Kris Hanke/Getty Images

A body mass index under 25 is deemed normal and healthy, and a higher BMI that's ""overweight"" or ""obese"" is not. But that might be changing, at least when it comes to risk of death.

The body mass index, or BMI, associated with the lowest risk of death has increased since the 1970s, a study finds, from 23.7, in the ""normal"" weight category, to 27, which is deemed ""overweight.""

That means a person who is 5-foot-8 could weigh 180 pounds and be in that epidemiological sweet spot, according to the NIH's online BMI calculator. The results were published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.

The researchers came to that conclusion by looking at data from three studies of people in Copenhagen, one from the 1970s, one from the 1990s and one from 2003-2013. More than 100,000 people were involved. Because Denmark has an excellent national health registry, they were able to pinpoint the cause of death for every single one of those people.

The risk of death for people who are obese, with a BMI of 30 or greater, also declined, to the point that it was on a par with some people of so-called ""normal"" weight.

So being fatter, at least a bit, may be healthier.

""I was surprised as a scientist to see how clear the result was,"" Borge Nordestgaard, a clinical professor and chief physician at Copenhagen University Hospital and senior author of the study, told Shots.

So he and his colleagues sliced and diced the data to see what could account for the shift. They looked at age, sex, smoking, cancer and heart disease. The most relevant was the decline in smoking since the 1970s. But when they looked at the mortality rates in nonsmokers who had never had cancer or heart disease, it also became associated with a higher BMI over time.

So what's going on?

""Now we get into the speculation part, right? I know you journalists always want that,"" Nordestgaard says. ""One option certainly is over these three decades we have become much better at treating the cardiovascular risk factors that come with overweight and obesity.""

That includes treating high cholesterol with statins; treating high blood pressure with diet, exercise and an array of medications; and making concerted efforts to help people to control blood sugar.

People in Denmark got heavier on average over the course of the study, as they have in the United States and most other countries. By 2013, 56 percent of the Danes had a BMI of 25 or higher. So you could think, OK, the new average is a heavier average.

Or you could wonder if being a bit heavier somehow helps confer health benefits that affect longevity.

Researchers have long known that people who are very thin tend to have a shorter life expectancy, often because they're dealing with cancer or other serious illnesses. The sweet spot on the BMI/longevity axis is typically somewhere near the middle. But there's not much data to back the notion that a bit more pudge is protective. ""This is total speculation,"" Nordestgaard says.

The BMI has been vilified as a poor measure of an individual's health. Someone who is big, fit and well-muscled, like a pro football player, can peg an obese BMI. And all of the people in this study are white, so that's a limitation. But the BMI, which is a general measure of body fat, has proven useful for thinking about the health of large groups of people, as in this study.

Nordestgaard and his colleagues are going to dig into this more in an effort to figure out what's going on, but he cautions that these kinds of data dives can take many months.

But this does raise the prospect of whether it may soon be time to tweak the official definition of normal, healthy weight.",1
"Fruits and vegetables are staples in a healthy diet, and that includes one aimed at preventing cancer. Many studies have documented the lower risk of various cancers among people who eat more fresh produce, and avoid things like red and processed meat.

But the majority of those studies have focused on adults, and it’s becoming clear that many of cancer’s drivers start early in life, with genes and even with childhood exposures to potential carcinogens.

To investigate this further, Maryam Farvid, a research associate at Massachusetts General Hospital and a visiting scientist at the Harvard T. H. Chan School of Public Health, and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk. In a study reported in the BMJ, they plumbed the Nurses’ Health Study, a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes, including cancer.

About half of the 90,000 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study also answered questions about their typical diet while they were teens. Those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a 25% lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit.

MORE: With Early Breast Cancer Treatment, Less May be More: Studies

Certain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer — apples, bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk.

Farvid says that apples, bananas and grapes contain fiber, which could help to lower cancer risk; they are also high in flavonoids, which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth. Kale and oranges are high in vitamin C, another antioxidant.

“This study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health,” says Farvid. “This study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program.”

Farvid wasn’t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk, but says that may be because the study wasn’t powered enough to detect an effect.

The findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later, and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age, especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life.

The results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit, rather than fruit juice. In the study, Farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk; that may be because fruit’s anti-cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit, which is stripped out of juice. In the latest Dietary Guidelines for Americans, however, government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice. “We recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice,” says Farvid, “because maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber, and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it.”

In another study also published in the BMJ, a separate group of researchers found that among 22,000 Danish women, those who added two alcoholic drinks a day on average increased their risk of developing breast cancer by 30% over five years. The added risk of cancer, however, was counterbalanced by a lower risk of heart disease.

Taken together, the results show how critical diet can be in modulating risk of breast cancer. While challenging, changing diet can be a relatively easy way to alter a woman’s breast cancer risk equation, beginning even at a young age.

"Researchers at MIT have developed a two-step cream that tightens and protects skin, providing a temporary face lift and perhaps offering new ways to deliver drugs.

"The “skin” can last for more than a day.

One of the first applications, said Dr. Barbara A. Gilchrest, a dermatology professor who is part of the research team, was on undereye bags, a condition that plagues so many middle-aged and older people.

“We wanted something that is elegant, and the ultimate test is right there on your face,” she said. “You really can’t see it. It’s there. It looks normal. We saw that as a very high bar. If you can achieve that you’ve done something impressive.”

(The researchers emphasize that the second skin is significantly different from a product that Living Proof tried to market a few years ago as a cosmetic that could correct undereye bags.)

Those studies included tests on people with undereye bags and those with dry skin on their legs. In one study, participants put second skin on their forearms to see how quickly the skin returned to normal after it was pinched in a suction cup — a test of elasticity. In another study, people were randomly assigned to use second skin or a placebo under their eyes. Trained observers graded the subjects on the appearance of the undereye skin. The product’s durability was tested in volunteers who wore it while running in heat and working up a sweat, while swimming, and while going out in a rainstorm.

One of the important uses, the researchers said, is in treating eczema and the sort of dry skin that comes with aging, with dry itchy patches on the back and legs that keep people up at night, scratching.

“We tell people to pat their skin with a damp washcloth and put on a heavy moisturizer, but that only lasts a short time,” Dr. Gilchrest said. “They end up with greasy goo all over the sheets, and they wake up in the middle of the night, terribly uncomfortable. We need something that was easier to use and didn’t make a mess and stays. Which is what this stuff does.”

Another application of the second skin is to keep drugs like cortisone creams on the skin, Dr. Anderson said. Less than 10 percent of what is applied stays there. “The other 90 percent ends up on your pillowcase or your clothes.”",1
"Carbohydrates sound so innocent: mere starches, sugar and fiber that the body uses for energy. Yet health-conscious Americans despise them, designing entire diets just to cut them out.

But out of the pile of cast-off carbs, there are some you should keep. New research around a certain kind of carb, called “resistant starch,” suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight.

When we eat refined carbohydrates, like white bread and cookies, our bodies absorb them very quickly, and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells. Eat a lot of them, and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them—which is why we gain weight on high-carb diets.

But that’s not the case with resistant starches, so named because they resist digestion. These kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine (where most food is digested) and head to the large intestine (also known as the colon) to be metabolized. There, they’re fermented and turned into short-chain fatty acids, which the body burns as energy. Resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics—food for intestinal bacteria in the colon.

Those benefits—getting digested slower, being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria—set resistant starch apart. Resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type-2 diabetes; eating it improved certain measures of inflammation, a condition that often precedes type-2 diabetes, and lipid profiles in women with the condition, showed one 2015 study.

“Certain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time,” says Paul Arciero, professor in the health and exercise sciences department of Skidmore College. “In my belief, that’s what’s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern-day high carbohydrate diet.”

Luckily, resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods. Legumes, beans, whole grains and some seeds have it, as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas. Products made from these foods, including bean flour, potato starch, tapioca starch and brown rice flour, also count.

Most intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch. When you cook a certain starchy food, like white rice, pasta or a potato, and then cool it in the refrigerator, the food develops resistant starches. “Cooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food,” Arciero explains. Stick it in the fridge, and as the food cools, those bonds reform in a new design. “The ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine,” Arciero says. Even if you heat them up again, they retain their new resistant starches.

In all of its forms, resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight. In a Nutrition Journal study published in October 2015, Arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for 70 women. The four pancakes were made from ordinary starch, starch plus whey protein, resistant starch (a tapioca-based starch modified to become resistant—much like leftovers are), and resistant starch with whey protein.

Arciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned, and what type. To Arciero’s surprise, after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein, they experienced an increase in fat burning, compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes. “After you eat a meal that’s principally carbohydrate, the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual,” he says. Adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller, they found—which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight. “If you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg, or whey protein, or pea protein, or chicken or Greek yogurt, that’s a pretty powerful combination,” Arciero says.

It’s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people lose weight. But the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety. “The potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high-carbohydrate food, though we don’t know yet how significantly, is fascinating,” Arciero says—especially when it’s as simple and delicious as reheating your pasta.

"An Online Program May Help Prevent Depression In Some People

Enlarge this image toggle caption WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images

Working through a self-help program online can prevent or delay major depression disorder in people who are vulnerable, a study finds. Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say.

Online programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they're not panaceas.

In this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy.

In the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences.

For the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into ""manageable"" and ""unmanageable""; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable.

Both cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior.

After completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked.

The control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it.

The study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association.

Of the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group.

It is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown.

It's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says.

Other experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things.

""More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,"" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers.

""I was surprised by the big response to our study,"" Buntrock wrote. ""And of course, I'm surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members. It's a success story you might dream of when you start, but it actually seeing to happen is a great feeling.""",1
"Scientists have some great news for those who love coffee, tea and wine: Drinking any of these beverages is associated with a healthier and more diverse community of microbes living in the gut.

The opposite is true for consuming sugary drinks and whole milk, as well as for eating a lot of carbohydrates and indulging in frequent snacks, researchers reported this week in the journal Science.

In other words, when it comes to the makeup of your gut microbiome, you are what you eat -- and drink.

“In total we found 60 dietary factors that influence diversity,” said Dr. Alexandra Zhernakova, a researcher at the University of Groningen in the Netherlands and the first author of the study, in a statement. “But there is good correlation between diversity and health: greater diversity is better.”

Your microbiome is the community of mostly beneficial bacteria, fungi and viruses that live on and in your body. These microscopic organisms earn their keep by helping you process food and regulating your immune system. Experts believe that the makeup of a person’s microbial community can also play a role in mood disorders, obesity and other diseases including irritable bowel syndrome.

But the study of the microbiome is relatively new, and scientists are still working out exactly what a healthy microbiome looks like.

Zhernakova and her colleagues helped fill in that picture by analyzing the microbes inside the guts of more than 1,100 people. They identified 126 factors that were correlated with changes in the makeup of an individual’s microbial community. These include 60 related to diet, 12 associated with diseases, 19 linked with drugs and four tied to smoking.

“To our knowledge, this is the first study to systematically assess such a broad range of host and environmental factors in relation to gut microbiome and at such a large scale,” said Jingyuan Fu, a systems geneticist at the University of Groningen who worked with Zhernakova.

The researchers analyzed stool samples of 1,135 Dutch participants in the Lifelines-DEEP study. The participants collected their own stool samples at home and then immediately put them in the freezer.

No more than a few days later, the samples were transported to labs at the university, where they remained frozen until they were processed by researchers. This ensured that none of the bacteria had a chance to grow or change from the time the sample was collected. Also, it guaranteed that all samples were treated the same way.

“In situations where samples are sent by post at room temperature, the time of the delivery for every sample is different,” she said. “That situation can lead to the growth of bacteria during transportation and adds additional ‘noise’ to the findings.”

After analyzing the samples and comparing them with other data collected in the Lifelines-DEEP study, the scientists found that consuming fruits, vegetables and yogurt positively influenced microbial diversity in the gut. So did drinking tea, wine, coffee and buttermilk.

On the flip side, sugary sodas and savory snacks were associated with lower levels of diversity. So was having irritable bowel syndrome and smoking during pregnancy.

Women tend to have more microbial diversity than men, and older people have greater microbial diversity than younger people, the researchers found.

The study does not address exactly why certain foods and behaviors influence the mix of microbes that populate a person’s gut. However, the researchers report that people who eat a lot of yogurt and buttermilk had higher levels of the bacteria that are used in the making of those foods in their guts.

”For more complex food, such as fruits and vegetables, we don’t know the answer,” Fu said. “We can suggest that changes in fiber content and carbohydrate composition are playing a role, but this should be studied in detail in respect to every food item.”

Fu also outlined many areas of research that the group hopes to tackle next. She said they are hoping to expand the study to 10,000 participants and follow them over time. They also want to collect samples from the nose and throat.

In a related study, researchers combed through thousands of human fecal samples to create a catalog of the microorganisms that colonize the human digestive system. They identified species of microorganisms from at least 664 different genera in the guts of close to 4,000 adults from the U.S., the United Kingdom, Belgium and the Netherlands.

When they expanded their collection of stool samples to include a small number of people from Papua New Guinea, Peru and Tanzania, the researchers detected a core group of 14 genera of microbes that were just about universally present.

These 14 genera were common to 95% of the humans sampled, and the species within these groups accounted for about 72% of their total gut microbiome. The main difference between individual people was the relative abundance of microbes from these core groups, including species from the Ruminococcaceae family and from the genera Bacteroides and Prevotella.

The researchers found several links between the diversity of gut flora and various aspects of biological function. For instance, people who reported looser stools were more likely to have a rich garden of microflora than those whose stools were harder and dryer.

The researchers also found significant associations between people’s genus abundance and their hip circumference, history of taking the antibiotic amoxicillin, uric acid concentrations (a factor in gout) and their preference for eating dark chocolate.

More than any single factor, the use of a wide range of drugs influenced microbiome variation among the people in this study. The clearest patterns emerged in those who had a recent history of taking antibiotics, osmotic laxatives, medications for inflammatory bowel disease, benzodiazepines, antidepressants, antihistamines or hormones used for birth control or to alleviate symptoms of menopause.

But contrary to some expectations, the data did not show that the abundance of microbes in the adult gut was influenced by whether the person was born in a vaginal delivery or by C-section. Nor did researchers find any evidence that those who were breast-fed as babies had more diverse microbiomes when they grew up.

Still, both studies underscore that a healthy microbiome is a key component of a healthy body, even if scientists are still working to understand exactly how each influences the other.

The day may come when patients routinely provide doctors with stool samples to help better understand their health, Fu said.

“It is becoming more and more clear that the gut microbiome serves as a sort of fingerprint that captures all kinds of signals about host health,” she said.

"The growing number of patients who claim marijuana has helped them drop their painkiller habit has intrigued lawmakers and emboldened advocates. Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers.

It's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions.

Advocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments.

The research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it.

In Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling ""like a zombie,"" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids.

""Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,"" Ham said. ""Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy.""

Bolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot.

Authorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody.

""I don't think it's a cure for everybody,"" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. ""But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?""

Most states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment.

This month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called ""the number-one killer in Pennsylvania"" - opioid abuse.

""Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,"" Vereb said. ""Let's face it, that's the killer. What we're doing today is the healer.""

""It's hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,"" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. ""But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end.""

No place immune to America's opioid epidemic

In New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana.

There are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option.

""We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,"" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health.

Cannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution.

""If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,"" he said. ""However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction.""

The findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data.

Substance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed.

""When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,"" Witman said. ""They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves. Most importantly, I'm able to get them back to gainful employment.""",1
"The Mediterranean diet includes lots of fish, plenty of fruits and vegetables, portions of whole grains, and very little meat. This classic diet does not exclude a dinnertime glass of wine, however, sugary drinks, fried food, and sweets are not on the menu. Scientists believe this style of eating offers some protection against mental aging, and, above all else, it is heart healthy.

A new study of over 15,000 people in 39 countries explored the benefits of this diet for one special group: those already diagnosed with heart disease. Surprisingly, the results suggest it might be possible they can have their cake and eat it, too.

Participants eating a Mediterranean diet showed a lower risk of heart attack and stroke, the researchers discovered; yet, eating healthy food appeared to be more important than avoiding unhealthy foods identified as typical of a so-called Western diet, such as French fries, fatty red meats, and, yes, even cake. (Though diet names refer to regions, they are not precise.)

Led by Professor Ralph Stewart from the University of Auckland, New Zealand, a team of researchers asked 15,482 older adults with stable coronary artery disease to complete a lifestyle questionnaire. With an average age of 67, each was a participant in GlaxoSmithKline’s STABILITY drug trial, created to learn whether the drug reduced the risk of heart attacks, strokes, and deaths. Participants lived in Western and Eastern Europe, North and South America, and the Asia Pacific region.

They answered questions about their diet and reported how many times a week they consumed servings from separate food groups. Looking at their answers, researchers gave them points in either the Mediterranean diet or Western diet category.

Over nearly four years, 1,588 (about 10 percent) of the study participants suffered either a heart attack or stroke, or died. Those who ate more foods in the Mediterranean diet category were 3.5 times less likely to experience one of these three events than people whose diets more closely resembled the Western standard.

In fact, every one-point increase in a participant’s Mediterranean diet score was linked with a 7 percent reduction in risk of heart attack, stroke, or death. Look at it this way: if 100 people ate the highest proportion of Mediterranean foods and 100 ate the least, there would be three fewer heart attacks, strokes, or deaths among those who ate more foods from the Mediterranean diet. These findings held for every geographical region.

Now here’s the interesting part: eating more foods thought to be less healthy — those typical of Western diets —did not link to an increase in heart attacks, strokes, or deaths. Eating more healthy foods was the key, even if some unhealthy foods were also consumed along the way.

According to Stewart, the meaning behind the numbers is clear. Instead of avoiding unhealthy foods, people with weak hearts might focus more on consuming healthy foods. That said, Stewart notes his study has limitations, including a lack of strict guidelines about portion size and no measure of total calories.

Long-standing American Heart Association guidelines recommend a diet primarily consisting of fruits, vegetables, fish, and other whole foods, with limited amounts of sodium, sugar, saturated fats, and refined carbohydrates. Eat as you dare.

"A North Carolina teen said he's feeling ""hopeful"" after getting an infusion of stem cells during an experimental procedure that may help heal his heart and extend his life.

Caleb Sizemore, 19, was diagnosed with Duchenne muscular dystrophy 12 years ago. The genetic disorder is characterized by progressive muscle degeneration and weakness. The disease can lead to scarring on muscles, including the heart. As scarring on the heart worsens, it affects the organ's ability to function and can be fatal.

In February, Sizemore became the first patient ever to get an infusion of stem cells into his heart in the hopes of stopping or even reversing some of the scarring related to the disease.

Dr. John Jefferies, director of advanced heart failure and cardiomyopathy at the Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, is treating Sizemore. He said a person suffering from Duchenne usually lives into his or her early 30s because of scarring on the heart.

""We’re going in and trying to reverse the scar tissue and potentially even mitigate the new development of scar tissue,"" Jefferies told ABC News. ""If we can preserve his cardiac function he has a fantastic outlook.""

Jefferies explained that the process works by allowing the stem cells to enter the heart, thus encouraging the heart to heal itself.

The stem cells ""create a healthy environment"" in the heart and help the tissue ""go from abnormal state to normal state,"" Jefferies noted.

Jefferies said if the medication works on patients like Sizemore, it could then be tested on millions of other Americans who have scarring on their heart due to the disease or past heart attacks.

""It is very exciting especially because of the impact it has on other kids and how it paves the way so that others can get the treatment and how this will change people’s lives and extend them,"" Sizemore said.

The teenager said he also has renewed optimism for his own health.

""It’s made me more hopeful,"" Sizemore said. ""Especially when I think of how amazing medical treatments and technology is and how far it’s gotten...especially since I was diagnosed 12 years ago.""

Sizemore will return to Cincinnati in a few months so doctors can scan his heart and see if the scar tissue has been affected by the infusion.",1
"(Reuters Health) - New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term “mini-strokes” offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half.

The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, are more evidence of the benefits of sending someone to a hospital even if muscle weakness or slurred speech has only lasted for a few seconds, lead author Dr. Pierre Amarenco of Bichat Hospital in Paris told Reuters Health by phone.

That’s because mini-strokes, also known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are often the harbinger of a potentially-deadly stroke that can come within a matter of hours or days.

“You should worry about symptoms even if they last for just a few seconds or a few minutes,” Amarenco said.

“The study showed that the widespread, systematic implementation of specialized TIA units across multiple sites, countries, and continents can make a difference in the care of these patients,” write Drs. Ralph Sacco and Tatjana Rundek of the University of Miami in an accompanying editorial.

The ongoing study, which used previous stroke estimates for comparison, was based on data from 4,789 patients from TIAregistry.org, an international registry designed to follow cases for as long as five years.

It didn’t include a comparison group, which would offer the best evidence, but it “helps build the evidence base for the importance of getting in for early treatment,” said Dr. Donna Arnett, dean of public health at the University of Kentucky and past president of the American Heart Association.

Any kind of mini-stroke “should lead you to be evaluated,” said Arnett, who was not involved in the study.

Research reported prior to 2004 had suggested that the stroke risk is 10 percent two days after mini-stroke symptoms appear and between 8 percent and 20 percent for the 30- to 90-day period after symptom onset.

But in the new study, Amarenco and his colleagues found stroke risks of 1.5 percent at two days, 2.1 percent at seven days and 3.7 percent at 90 days when mini-strokes were treated aggressively.

One year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1 percent.

“Although this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units, these (newly-reported) risks are substantially lower than expected. Outcomes in this study were at least 50 percent lower than those reported in previous studies,” Sacco and Rundek write.

“The rate was remarkably lower,” Arnett told Reuters Health. The study was also noteworthy because, over the long haul, patients did a particularly good job of taking the medications they were given.

The researchers also found that the one-year stroke risk doubled when multiple blood vessel clogs were seen with brain imaging, a large artery was narrowed by heart disease and the patient scored a 6 or 7 on a seven-point scale that assesses stroke risk factors.

More than two thirds of the patients in the study had a score of 4 or higher but the researchers caution that “limiting urgent assessment to patients with a score of 4 or more would miss approximately 20 percent of those with early recurrent strokes.”

"Robison, 58, is autistic. At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger’s syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction.

For the first time in many years, John Elder Robison entered a sixth-floor lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and settled into a chair. He was there to demonstrate — although not actually repeat — a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient’s brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression.

Advertisement

Beginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC’s Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison’s new book, “Switched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening.”

In a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of “Awakenings” and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones — and the not so welcome.

After his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. “The experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,” he writes. “Perhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism.”

Other striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent.

“The change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,” he said during an interview in a hospital conference room.

His book is likely to spark even greater interest — and funding — in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so.

“My world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,” he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically.

“I feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it’s there, or it really is there, it’s all the same,” added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged.

Robison also happens to be a gifted writer — his 2007 memoir “Look Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger’s” was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He’s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations.

Still, for all the positive changes described in “Switched On,” Robison’s fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his “protective shield” of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times.

His second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison’s public profile rose — since “Look Me in the Eye,” he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness — it disrupted his life on many levels.

At his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he’d never possessed caused “a mixture of sadness and wonder,” Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: “jarred.”

Robison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in “Running With Scissors,” the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison’s brother, Augusten Burroughs.

“Switched On” revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology.

A “techno geek” with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems — he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS — Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS’s potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical School.

During the interview, Robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his TMS sessions, and the impact they’ve had on his life since then. People close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it. Or even if an “improved” version of himself would be someone they could love as much.

“Some thought I was crazy to let them do that to my brain, but I never had that fear,” said Robison. “The technology was thoroughly familiar to me. And even though I knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong, I had confidence that a Harvard teaching hospital would use them safely.”

Weighing the risk-reward balance, he continued, “I wondered, what if [the sessions] could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people? I’d concluded that one reason I was kind of down was, I could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way. People would ask, ‘Can’t you tell how happy you made us?’ Well, no, I’d say. I can’t.”

Even a 1 percent chance at success seemed worth the odds, Robison went on. And even if, as he’d been warned, any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the 30-minute treatments themselves.

The negatives? These, too, he has come to accept.

“I was probably naive at the outset,” he admitted. “I had this idea that if I could only ‘get’ these happy messages, I would be happier. It didn’t occur to me that most of the news out there, most of the emotion, is, if not bad, at least not all good. Not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed. It was overpowering.”

Robison’s TMS research team was led by Harvard neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, who supplies an introduction to “Switched On.” In a separate interview, Pascual-Leone says Robison’s book demonstrates how small changes in brain function, however temporary, can have a life-changing impact.

Imagine, Pascual-Leone says, someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue — an abstract, meaningless concept. Suddenly, for a brief period, he’s able to see the sky in color. Forever after, the idea of “blue” will no longer be meaningless.

“Now translate that concept to emotions,” he continues. “If you can give [someone like Robison] an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face, then it enables his brain, without TMS, to change the way he approaches life and people.”

Nevertheless, Pascual-Leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial, as Robison describes. A recent paper by the BIDMC team concluded that TMS, while appealing and worth further study, is not yet recommended as an autism treatment. Rather, it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder, including depression.

Still, there are a number of clinics currently offering TMS as an autism treatment, a practice that concerns many researchers. “People are desperate to help their loved ones, which I understand,” Pascual-Leone says. “Will it get more attention because of John’s book? Absolutely. But his book does illustrate that the consequences can be long-lasting, and detrimental.”

Robison remains optimistic that as research continues, the potential benefits will outweigh the risks.

“I owe a great debt [to the Harvard team] for helping me see I was not broken or defective,” he said. “That this painful disability of mine was a rare gift.”

“People are scared of the science-fiction aspect to this, but it’s real,” he added. “And what I wrote about in the book isn’t 10 percent of what they’re doing now.”

“Switched On” ends in 2013. Robison, now happily remarried, says he’s become even more militant advocating on behalf of what he calls “my tribe.”

“You can look at my success in the world,” he said, “and it’s not just in my mind. It’s undeniable.”

“The change [after the therapy] in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,” Robison said. Keith Bedford/Globe Staff/Globe Staff

"New research suggests that all women turning 40 should get a breast cancer risk assessment, since half of them may have risks that are high enough to warrant annual mammograms right away.

The finding is important because the latest guidelines on mammograms advise that most women can wait until the age of 45 or 50 to start having annual screenings.

But the review of female patients between the ages of 40 and 44 found that 50 percent had an above-average risk for breast cancer, and therefore would be eligible to begin screening mammography at age 40, said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Plichta. She's a breast surgery fellow at Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

How to navigate differing breast cancer screening guidelines

The study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods, including breast MRI and genetic testing, Plichta said.

""We believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages 40 to 44 in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of 40, and those who would qualify for screening MRIs and genetic testing,"" Plichta said.

Plichta was to present her team's findings Thursday at the American Society of Breast Surgeons annual meeting in Dallas. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the American Cancer Society and the American Society of Breast Surgeons.

The cancer society updated its guidelines in 2015, recommending that women could wait until age 45 to start receiving annual mammograms. Previously, the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age 40.

The American Society of Breast Surgeons (ASBS) subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation, Plichta said. However, she noted the ASBS added a few extra conditions:

Women should start mammograms earlier than 45 if they have a calculated lifetime risk greater than 15 percent.

Women with a 20 percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer also should undergo screening MRIs.

Women with a 5 percent or greater risk of a breast cancer-related genetic mutation should receive genetic testing.

""Critical to the development and interpretation of both of these new guidelines is formal risk assessment,"" Plichta said. ""Furthermore, risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography, but also who may require screening MRIs and/or genetic testing.""

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommendations state that most women begin mammography at age 50. However, they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier.

The new study involved more than 900 women. None had been diagnosed with breast cancer. All were seen as new patients at the Massachusetts General Hospital breast clinic between March 2011 and October 2015, the researchers said.

Fifty percent of these women met either the ACS or the ASBS requirements for early mammography, Plichta said. That includes 39 percent who met the ACS criteria for above-average risk for breast cancer, and an additional 11 percent who met the American Society of Breast Surgeons' criteria.

The researchers also found that 32 percent of the women met the groups' eligibility standards for regular screening MRIs, and 25 percent would be eligible for genetic testing, Plichta said.

Breast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group, the researchers noted. Since the new guidelines lean heavily on knowing breast cancer risk, doctors need to redouble their efforts to make sure risk assessments are done for women in their early 40s, they concluded.",1
"Pregnancy experts, including those at the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, recommend that most pregnant women get 30 minutes of exercise a day. If that feels a little onerous, consider new findings out of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston suggesting that love of physical activity may start in the womb.

So maybe women who won’t exercise for their own sake will do it for the baby.

The research in question involved mice, not women. A team led by Robert A. Waterland, an assistant professor of pediatrics, nutrition and molecular and human genetics, selected female mice that enjoyed running, according to a press release. (“Enjoyed”? Did they smile?) Half of them were put in cages with running wheels during pregnancy; the other half had no wheels.

The mice with running wheels voluntarily ran an average of more than six miles a night, decreasing to about two miles late in pregnancy. The offspring of those mothers turned out to be about 50 percent more physically active than those born to mothers that hadn’t had the exercise wheel option. And that difference persisted into mouse adulthood.

How does this relate to our own species?

Observational studies of active pregnant women and their babies have reported “results consistent with ours,” Waterland said. But in the human studies, it wasn’t always clear whether active mothers who have active children simply raised their kids to exercise a lot or whether there might have been a genetic predisposition to physical activity. The Baylor scientists were able to correct for those variables.

“Our study in a mouse model is important because we can take all those effects out of the equation,” Waterland said. “I think our results offer a very positive message. If expectant mothers know that exercise is not only good for them but also may offer lifelong benefits for their babies, I think they will be more motivated to get moving.”",1
"Walnuts have long been touted as a healthy, whole food, but new research just upped the homely nut's reputation another notch.

In a study by researchers from the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona and Loma Linda University, more than 700 older, healthy adults were asked to add either a handful of walnuts to their daily diets or to follow their normal diet without eating nuts.

After one year, both groups experienced minimal body weight, triglyceride, and HDL cholesterol changes, but the walnut-eaters had significant reductions in LDL cholesterol (""bad"" cholesterol) compared to the nut-free control group.

The research shows the well-known cholesterol-lowering effect of eating walnuts works equally well in the elderly, even in the long term, the authors reported at the Experimental Biology conference in San Diego.

""Given walnuts are a high-energy food, a prevailing concern has been that their long-term consumption might be associated with weight gain,"" said study author Dr. Emilio Ros, director of the Lipid Clinic, Endocrinology & Nutrition Service at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona, in a press statement. """"It's encouraging to see that eating walnuts may benefit this particular population.""

Other walnut studies presented at the conference, funded in part by the California Walnut Commission, suggested the omega-3 fatty acid-rich nut may also benefit gut bacteria and help reduce inflammation.

Elisabetta Politi, nutrition director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University, said, ""We advocate that people eat nuts, including walnuts, because they are high in healthy fat, low in carbohydrates and a good source of protein.""

Politi said a serving of walnuts is about 14 halves, which adds up to 180 calories. They're rich in fiber, folic acid, and potassium. Walnuts are especially heart healthy because they have more polyunsaturated fat than almonds, cashews, peanuts, pecans, pistachios, and macadamia nuts per serving. Walnut oil can be a good alternative too, in dressings and for light basting, Politi said.

It's still important to remember portion control, especially for people on weight loss programs, warned Politi.

""Try a serving in a snack bag. Eat walnuts mindfully,"" she said.",1

MONDAY, March 28, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture can help alleviate the often-debilitating hot flashes that afflict many breast cancer patients, new Italian research says.

Noting that hot flashes are a fact of life for many women with breast cancer, the investigators found that pairing lifestyle advice with weekly acupuncture sessions dramatically improved the women's quality of life.

""Acupuncture together with enhanced self-care for three months is effective in reducing hot flashes in women with breast cancer,"" said study author Giorgia Razzini, a clinical trial project manager in the oncology unit of Ospedale di Carpi (Carpi Hospital), in Bologna, Italy.

And because hormone treatment for breast cancer typically makes the hot flash experience even worse, Razzini added, acupuncture could be a useful tool for helping such patients ""stay on their therapy and improve their quality of life.""

Razzini and colleagues published their findings online March 28 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

In the study, the Italian team focused on 190 breast cancer patients who had reported moderate (or worse) hot flashes while undergoing treatment at five cancer hospitals and one primary health care center in northern Italy between 2010 and 2013.

The patients, whose average age was 49, were randomly split into two groups. One group of 105 patients was offered a three-month regimen of self-care advice on diet, exercise and psychological support.

The second group, of 85, was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with 10 half-hour weekly sessions of ""traditional"" acupuncture.

All of the participants kept hot flash diaries. At the end of the three-month period (and for up to six months thereafter) daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency.

The result: by the end of the treatment period, those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were 50 percent lower than those in the non-acupuncture group. The finding continued to hold up for a half-year after the acupuncture sessions ended.

Those in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health, with no serious side effects, the study authors said.

So why does acupuncture seem to work?

Razzini cited several reasons, including acupuncture's ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient's nervous system, while stimulating the release of endorphins -- a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion. It also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine, as well as the mood regulator serotonin.

Razzini didn't know how much American patients might have to pay for such treatment, but added, ""Compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants, (acupuncture) should be less expensive, and, for sure, more safe and feasible.""

Dr. Courtney Vito, a breast oncologic surgeon at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look.

""Anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice, because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti-hormonal treatment can be profound,"" she said.

""Almost all women experience them. For some it's a moderate situation, but for others it's a really significant problem. Some women -- I would say probably about 15 percent -- have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by 50 percent, simply because they can't handle the hot flashes,"" Vito explained.

""And I've actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success, so I'm not surprised by the finding,"" she added. ""But it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work. Which, in the end, may help to encourage insurance companies to their expand coverage so this can become an affordable option for all patients in need.""

"There’s growing evidence that concussions may have more lasting effects than previously thought, and that monitoring people with head injuries, no matter how apparently minor, is crucial to ensuring they receive proper treatment and minimize the effects of the trauma.

But there aren’t good ways to distinguish between mild blows that don’t require additional care and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury (TBI), which could have more serious consequences. Currently, CT scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing TBI, but they can’t pick up every case. And because the expose patients to radiation, doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient, especially young children, who come to the emergency room with a head injury.

But in a study published in JAMA Neurology, scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of TBI that require further evaluation. Led by Dr. Linda Papa, director of clinical research and an emergency physician at Orlando Regional Medical Center, the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury. Papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins, or biomarkers, change immediately after head trauma.

They collected blood from 584 people coming to the Orlando Regional Medical Center, which is a Level 1 Trauma Center, for trauma-related injuries. About half them had brain-related injuries, and half had other traumas, including broken bones and chest injuries. Papa wanted to test several things about the blood test, including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body. All of the people had their blood drawn 19 times, starting at within four hours of their injury and up to 7 days later. By tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time, Papa could see how they changed, and correlate that with the people’s symptoms.

MORE: Concussion Expert: Over 90% of NFL Players Have Brain Disease

In all people, regardless of the type of injury they had, the levels of the proteins, called GFAP and UCH-L1, rose within the first hour after the injuries. GFAP, which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system (which includes the brain and spinal cord), peak at 20 hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later. UCH-L1 is released by brain nerves when they’re stressed, and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours.

When Papa then looked just at people who showed signs of TBI on CT scans, she found that their levels of GFAP and UCH-L1 were significantly higher than those of people with other types of trauma, suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to TBI and not trauma in general.

“We don’t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don’t need them,” says Papa of using CT scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don’t experience any symptoms. “I don’t think a blood will be the be-all and end-all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making.”

Testing for levels of UCH-L1, for example, might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries, since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma. It might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which, if they have higher levels of the blood marker, should not.

MORE: A New Blood Test to Diagnose Concussions On The Field

In the emergency room, a blood test for UCH-L1 could also help doctors decide which patients should get a CT scan — the higher their levels of the protein are, the more likely they are to have TBI and would benefit from a scan, while those with lower levels probably don’t need one.

And because levels of GFAP tend to remain higher for many days, Papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don’t come in immediately after a head injury, thinking they’re okay, but see the doctor several days later because they’re concerned. Even at that point, the study shows, GFAP levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate TBI and need for further tests.

“We may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark, a blood test could definitely help,” she says.

"Despite considerable progress in prevention and treatment, heart disease continues to be the leading cause of death in the United States. When patients suffer from a heart attack or other cardiac event, it's critical that they get appropriate care and adopt lifestyle changes to prevent future damage.

Participating in a cardiac rehabilitation program has been proven to be particularly effective in helping patients recover and stay healthy. Research indicates that CR improves five-year mortality rates by 25 to 46 percent for patients following a heart attack or other cardiac event. In fact, CR has been given a Class 1A recommendation by the American Heart Association/American College of Cardiology Foundation for secondary prevention of coronary heart disease, making it a critical component of the standard of care.

In recent years, Intensive cardiac rehabilitation programs have been created as enhanced alternatives to ordinary CR. Patients and their physicians choose ICR programs over CR for at least three reasons: they are backed by published clinical evidence supporting their efficacy; they offer more complete education and exercise to improve patients' health; and they achieve greater patient adherence to the prescribed course of care.

ICR Programs Have Documented Results

Medicare covers both CR and ICR, but only ICR programs are required to meet specific efficacy standards. Each Medicare-approved ICR program must demonstrate through peer-reviewed published research that it has a positive impact on cardiac outcomes, such as decreasing the need for bypass surgery or stenting, and reduces specific risk factors for cardiovascular disease. One of the Medicare-approved programs, Pritikin ICR, is based on a lifestyle change program that has more than 100 peer-reviewed studies validating its effectiveness, including significantly reducing levels of cholesterol and triglycerides, body mass index and blood pressure, as well as reducing risk factors for diabetes, breast cancer, prostate cancer and other comorbidities. R. James Barnard, Ph.D., a researcher at the University of California–Los Angeles and a co-author of many of these studies, says, ""These studies have consistently shown the value of a more comprehensive approach to health – combining exercise with proper nutrition and a healthy mindset – at preventing, controlling or reversing common diseases, including heart disease, diabetes and hypertension, and have proven the long-term sustainability of these lifestyle changes."" When physicians refer their cardiac patients to an ICR program, they can have confidence knowing that the program has been proven to be effective.

ICR Offers More In-Depth Education on Lifestyle Change

In practice, ordinary CR is undertaken in a series of up to 36 individual sessions, and patients typically spend most of that time on exercise rather than education and counseling to modify cardiac risk factors. In contrast, Medicare covers 72 sessions of ICR, allowing patients to supplement the exercise portion of ordinary CR with an in-depth education about the relationship between lifestyle and cardiovascular health. Each day of ICR includes both an exercise class and at least one class with practical lessons on how to make better nutrition choices, manage stress, stop smoking or maintain a positive attitude. This type of education is crucial for many patients to recover from a cardiovascular event and optimize their health going forward.

Dr. Albert Krause, cardiac rehab medical director at CHRISTUS Health in Shreveport-Bossier, Louisiana, said that ICR ""allows hospitals to provide cardiac patients with a comprehensive education about critical lifestyle changes following a heart attack or other cardiac event. It is an essential component of our continuum of care, complementing the surgical and medical treatments we offer, to improve patients' long-term outcomes.""

ICR Achieves Better Patient Engagement

ICR programs also have improved patient engagement compared to ordinary CR. A study recently published in JAMA Internal Medicine found that only 62 percent of eligible cardiac patients are referred by their physician to a CR program, and only one-third of those patients actually attend the program. These patients attend an average of 20 to 24 sessions of ordinary CR, despite being prescribed up to 36 sessions. In comparison, a review of a sample of hospitals that recently implemented ICR programs all experienced a significantly higher level of patient adherence to the prescribed course of rehabilitation. Most of these hospitals averaged over 48 sessions per patient in the second half of 2015 – over double the industry average for ordinary CR.

As Dr. John Harvey, president and medical director of Oklahoma Heart Hospital, says: Patients report high levels of satisfaction with ICR and feel encouraged to stick with the program and adopt a heart healthy lifestyle.""",1
"Broccoli has been linked to a growing list of health benefits, such as a reduced risk of cancer and osteoporosis. New research suggests consuming broccoli could also slow or reverse blood-vessel damage and atherosclerosis due to high cholesterol.

The study, in Experimental Biology and Medicine, found that a high-cholesterol diet combined with supplements containing sulforaphane, a natural compound in cruciferous vegetables such as broccoli and Brussels sprouts, significantly reduced levels of LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol, in rabbits, compared with a high-fat diet without the supplements. Sulforaphane-fed rabbits also had higher levels of good cholesterol and improved blood-vessel function.

Previous studies showed that sulforaphane can reduce inflammation in cultured vascular cells, but its effects on atherosclerosis hadn’t been studied directly, the researchers said. Sulforaphane has an “extraordinary” ability to trigger multiple enzymes that protect against oxidative or environmental stress and reduce inflammation, they suggest. The study, at Mansoura University in Egypt, involved three groups of five rabbits. Two of the groups were fed a high-cholesterol diet for four weeks, including one group that also received daily supplements of sulforaphane orally in a sodium solution. A control group got a normal diet without sulforaphane. Treatment with sulforaphane decreased total cholesterol, triglycerides and LDL by 43%, 70% and 40%, respectively, compared with untreated rabbits on a high-cholesterol diet. Sulforaphane treatment also enhanced levels of HDL, the so-called good cholesterol, above normal, according to the study. The cholesterol ratio, an indication of heart-disease risk, was close to control levels in sulforaphane-treated animals, the study said. After four weeks, CRP, or C-reactive protein, a marker of systemic inflammation, significantly decreased in suforaphane-treated rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet compared with rabbits on the same diet that didn’t get the supplement. CRP levels in sulforaphane-treated rabbits were almost at control levels. Blood vessels from rabbits on the high-cholesterol diet were atrophied and inflamed. There was mild vessel swelling in sulforaphane-treated rabbits, while control rabbits had normal vessels. Caveat: Sulforaphane hasn’t been tested on people with high cholesterol. The equivalent quantity of broccoli in humans wasn’t mentioned. Sulforaphane attenuates the development of atherosclerosis and improves endothelial dysfunction in hypercholesterolemic rabbits

"America’s ongoing battle with weight-loss that has led to fad diets and invasive surgeries like gastric bypass and stomach stapling. Now, there is a new solution for people with a body mass index (BMI) between 30 and 40 that want to lose weight called the Orbera gastric balloon.

Dr. Prem Chattoo, a New York based gastroenterologist, told FoxNews.com that the balloon is placed it into the stomach through the mouth. It is then inflated with saline during the procedure that lasts about 45 minutes. Patients are treated in office and are kept under mild to moderate sedation. The balloon remains in the patient’s stomach for six months and is then removed the same way it was inserted, through the mouth.

“The beauty of the procedure is that it is a nonsurgical procedure,” Chattoo said. In addition to eliminating the scarring and risks involved with more invasive options, Chattoo said that the recovery time is also much faster.

The objective of the Orbera system is the make the patient feel partially satiated so they eat smaller, but more nutritious portions. Chattoo also offers patients a nutritionist and trainer with the procedure. The hope is that patients can train their body to eat in a much healthier fashion without feeling overly hungry.

Marie Brown chose to undergo the procedure and credits Orbera for helping her lose over 20 pounds in three and a half months. She told FoxNews.com that the balloon “makes you feel full all the time to the point where you’re not angry about having to lose things like chocolate and cake.”

Brown said that the balloon acted like a “restart button” and retrained her body to adapt to a new lifestyle of healthy eating and exercise.

Orbera is not for the morbidly obese or those who have had surgical procedures affecting the stomach or intestinal lining. It is meant for people looking for an extra jumpstart on a diet, whether the purpose is cosmetic or for health reasons.

“We might be able to prevent young, healthy people from having these chronic diseases like diabetes and hypertension,” Chattoo said.

The most common side effect of installing the balloon is nausea that lasts a few days. Chattoo said that even if the balloon were to pop, the saline would be absorbed and pose no harm to the patient. The balloon would be removed in the same way it is at the six month mark.

Orbera is not covered by insurance and costs $8,000. For more information, click here.",1
"While breathing fresh, clean air can boost productivity, sleep and overall health, not everyone can live in the great outdoors and it’s difficult to know just how clean the indoor air in your home or office is.

Since most people spend about 90 percent of their time inside, having poor indoor air quality could affect your health and the health of your family members—especially during winter.

“Low dry humidity in the winter can make asthma worse and children who have dried mucosa can acquire some nasal infections easier,” Dr. Robert G. Lahita, chairman of medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey, told FoxNews.com. “Heating ducts that have mold and spores in them can make respiratory symptoms worse in the winter when hot air is blowing through them. Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well.”

Different sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren’t the worst culprits, Lahita said.

“In the winter the biggest issue is carbon monoxide poisoning, with emergency medical services we see a few of these every year-- it is from faulty heaters, cooking without ventilation or fireplaces,” he said.

Every room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality.

Awair is the first smart air quality device that monitors, analyzes and provides feedback to improve the air you breathe. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality.

“The goal for the user is to keep five green dots. As soon as you see other colored (amber and red) dots show up on top of the green dots, your environment is getting off the healthy ranges whether it being temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, and dust,” Ronald Ro, the CEO and co-founder of Bitfinder Inc., the makers of Awair, told FoxNews.com.

Based on your air score, the monitoring gadget will send personalized alerts and advice to the user via its corresponding Awair mobile app. When air conditions are harmful, like when a bedroom has a high carbon dioxide level, it will send a notification to the user and advise them to open up a window through the app. The app also provides Mayo Clinic “message cards” that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy.

If you already have a smart device system for your home, Awair is working on partnerships with several connected devices like Nest thermostat and other smart appliances so you can manage the air quality in your home or office when you're not there.

The Awair app is free to download, but each device costs $199 dollars.

"(CNN) How much -- or how little -- you eat could influence how long you live.

The idea of caloric control improving your health, and therefore your lifespan, is nothing new, but researchers are now hoping to accurately determine the type of diet that could make you live longer.

One team at the University of Southern California ( USC) are reducing the calorie count as low as it can go, using specific foods to trick the human body into thinking it's fasting -- a process called fasting mimicry.

""Diet can have a remarkable effect on you,"" says Valter Longo, Professor of Gerontology at USC Davis, who has been long been researching the mechanisms behind human aging and has recently turned his attention to fasting.

""It can reprogram your body and put it on a path to live longer,"" says Longo.

Shutdown and regeneration

Fasting has been performed by communities and cultures for millennia and Longo's team are curious about the advantages.

Their idea follows on from the long running trend of caloric restriction, mostly known through diets such as the 5-2 diet and intermittent fasting. Longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month, believing that when the body thinks it's in a state of fasting, it shuts down and goes into standby mode.

""As cells are killed and the body goes into standby, your stem cells switch on,"" says Longo. Once switched on, the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass -- leaving you shiny and new.

When cells in the body age, their ratios change and Longo believes the body's reaction -- and repair methods -- to fasting help restore them to when you were younger. ""You're killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional.""

Starvation strategies

In a 2015 study , Longo's team set a specific diet for human volunteers, which mimicked the effects of fasting over five consecutive days monthly, for three months. Trials were also conducted in mice.

People consumed approximately 1000 calories on day one and 725 calories for the remaining four days, but these numbers alone didn't determine the benefit.

""It's not just about reducing calories"", says Longo. His diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein, fat and carbohydrates, for maximum effect. The food items used, however, were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients.

""The human fasting mimicking diet (FMD) program is a plant based diet program designed to attain fasting-like effects while providing micronutrient nourishment (vitamins, minerals, etc.) and minimize the burden of fasting,"" Longo said in the study

After three months, the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease. There was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body.

""The diet is turning on the body's ability to renew itself,"" says Longo.

The team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months.

How does it work?

""When you fast, you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways [in the body],"" says Longo. The pathways he refers to are known as TOR, PKA and IGF pathways, which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink.

This activation, or reduction, of pathways is why the components of the diet, such a proteins, must also be controlled. ""You won't activate the correct pathways,"" says Longo.

""When you make IGF less active, it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease,"" says Miguel Toribio-Mateas, Chairman of the British Association for Applied Nutrition and Nutritional Therapy.

According to Toribio-Mateas, the results confirm earlier theories that ""some hormone-like growth factors that are required during development to grow, then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached"". He also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level.

""Cells have a list of things to do every day,...like getting rid of toxins"" says Toribio-Mateas. If their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories, certain products can accumulate. ""Regulating calories can have a very positive effect,"" he says. To him, diet underpins longevity.

Is it safe?

Unlike the 5-2 diet, which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week, Longo's diet involves fasting for five consecutive days, which requires much more willpower.

""Five days is safe: going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic,"" says Longo.

More work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria. Longo has since founded his own nutrition company. L-Nutra, to sell products that serve this purpose, which may be seen as a conflict of interest. He states that profits are going back into funding further research by his team.

""The results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area,"" says Toribio-Mateas.",1
"(CNN) A new review of the ""little pink pill"" for women with low sexual desire says the drug doesn't work very well -- but some doctors and patients who've been using the treatment disagree. The drug, Addyi, or flibanserin , has been on the market since October.

""The data presented in this review suggests that the meaningful change caused by flibanserin is minimal,"" according to the team of Dutch researchers.

The researchers looked at eight studies on Addyi that together included nearly 6,000 women. They said for women using the drug, the number of additional ""satisfying sexual events"" averaged out to about 0.5 per month.

The agency asked Sprout Pharmaceuticals, which makes Addyi, to do more studies on the interaction between Addyi and alcohol.

The researchers said the drug had significant known side effects, such as dizziness, sleepiness, and nausea.

The FDA approved Addyi last August with a ""black box warning"" to highlight the risks of severe low blood pressure and fainting when patients drink alcohol, take certain drugs, or have liver problems.

'I was amazed'

Some doctors and patients who've been using Addyi say the drug has been helpful. There are no other FDA-approved treatments for women suffering from low sexual desire.

Dr. Lauren Streicher, medical director of the Center for Sexual Medicine at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago, said the results cited in the Dutch study are averages, and while Addyi doesn't work for everyone, many of her patients have benefited from it.

She says she's written Addyi prescriptions for about 10 women, and three or four have emailed her back to say it's worked. ""They say, 'Oh my God, this has changed my life. Things are wonderful,'"" Streicher said.

Jodi Cole, a 33-year-old stay-at-home mother from Porter, Oklahoma, said before she started taking Addyi, she didn't want to have sex with her husband, Matt. ""I love my husband and I believe God created emotional and sexual intimacy as key components of marriage. So we had sex, usually a couple of times a week. And while I was willing, part of me dreaded it. Every time,"" Cole wrote in an email to CNN.

Cole said she started taking Addyi in November, and within six weeks felt a difference. ""I was amazed,"" she wrote. ""I actually enjoyed being intimate and for the first time in a long time felt that connection with Matt.""

She said for her it wasn't about increasing the quantity of sex she was having, but rather the quality. ""What (Addyi) does is give just enough support so I can think about that part of our relationship with anticipation of pleasure rather than anxiety,"" she wrote. She understands Addyi can have side effects, but said women should be able to choose to take it just as men choose to take Viagra despite its side effects.

""I should be able to choose whether the side effects are worth the benefit,"" she wrote.

The controversy over Addyi

Seldom has one pill raised such controversy among medical professionals.

Doctors who treat women with low libidos tore apart the JAMA study. Streicher, an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, said the study drew ""erroneous conclusions.""

The International Society for the Study of Women's Sexual Health went even further, calling the study ""a great disservice to the millions of pre-menopausal women suffering from (hypoactive sexual desire disorder).""

The doctors had several problems with the study's methodology, including that three of the eight studies the Dutch researchers analyzed were not published. When studies are published, they go through a peer review process to assess whether the study methodology is sound.

One of those studies used a dosage of the drug that was half as high as what the FDA approved.

Dr. Loes Jasper, one of the authors of the Dutch analysis, said she and her colleagues removed the results from that study and still found that Addyi's affects were minimal.

She said she and her colleagues included the results of the unpublished studies because sometimes negative studies of a drug don't get published.

""We included all published and unpublished studies to capture a complete overview of the benefits and risks of flibanserin, without bias,"" Jaspers wrote in an email to CNN.

According to the FDA, which looked at three clinical trials of Addyi that included about 2,400 women, about 10% more patients treated with Addyi reported meaningful improvements in satisfying sexual events, sexual desire, or reduced distress compared to women taking a placebo.

In their editorial, Woloshine and Schwartz said Sprout and others put pressure on FDA to approve the drug.

""While it is unclear how strongly politics influenced the decision, it is clear that the science was weak,"" they wrote. ""We all need a drug approval process that delivers good decisions based on adequate evidence.""",1
"An ibuprofen patch that delivers the painkiller directly through the skin to the site of pain, at a consistent dose for up to 24 hours, has been developed by UK researchers.

Scientists at the University of Warwick and spin-off company Medherant say their TEPI patch could revolutionize the transdermal drug delivery market.

University of Warwick research chemist Professor David Haddleton told Reuters that the polymer matrix in the patch acts as a reservoir for the drug, capable of releasing between five and ten times the amount of drugs used in gels and patches currently on the market, for periods of six hours, 12 hours, and even 24 hours.

“What we do is dissolve the active ibuprofen, for example, into the adhesive so we can have quite a high loading - so up to 30 percent of the adhesive will be the ibuprofen,” said Haddleton. “When that’s placed on the skin just like an elastoplast then the drug will actually diffuse across the skin into the body at the site of the pain and then relieve the pain in the same way as current gels and creams. We’re controlling the dosage and we’re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time.”

The patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain, neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally. The team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off.

Although TEPI patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin, it is not uncomfortable to peel off, unlike many traditional plasters.

According to Andrew Lee, co-founder of Medherant, “we’ve only been in the lab about 12 months, but in the 12 months we’ve essentially assessed about 90 percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches. We’ve tested them in our polymers with very good results, we’ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we’ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well.”

The team says TEPI patches could go on sale within three years, and Medherant is working with some large, unnamed, pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market.

Haddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications, such as opioid painkillers. “What’s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we’re limited to about 20 different drugs, and there are thousands of drugs out there, and only about 20 are used in patches at the moment, which is limited by the technology of the adhesive, essentially,” he said.

Lee told Reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all, and merely sooth the body with a warming effect. He said Medherant’s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication.

“One of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven’t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery - or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because, for instance, they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally,” said Lee.

The TEPI patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company Bostik. Lee believes ibuprofen strips could be useful for sports participants, helping alleviate conditions such as tendonitis, and repetitive strain injuries. Nutrition companies have also shown an interest in adapting Medherant’s technology for transmitting minerals and vitamins through the skin.",1
"Two groups of scientists presented results at an HIV conference on Monday suggesting that a vaginal ring could prevent HIV transmission in women. In both studies, the ring lowered HIV cases by about 30%, though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently.

The ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine, which prevents HIV from making copies of itself. In the ring, the drug is used as “pre-exposure prophylaxis,” or PrEP, slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells.

One of the new studies, published today in the New England Journal of Medicine, tested the ring in more than 2,600 women in four countries — Malawi, SouthAfrica, Uganda, and Zimbabwe — over nearly two years. At the end of the study, the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had 27% fewer HIV infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug, the study found.

Looking by age, the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than 21. But among women over the age of 21 who used it, new HIV cases went down by 61%.

The other study, which has not yet been published but was presented on Monday at the Conference on Retroviruses and Opportunistic Infections meeting in Boston, studied 2,000 women in South Africa and Uganda. Like the other study, in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than 21, whereas new HIV cases dropped by 37% in women over 21.

These age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug, the researchers say. Much like the contraceptive NuvaRing, the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness.

“If used perfectly, how much HIV protection could there be? We don’t know that yet,” Jared Baeten, professor of global health, medicine, and epidemiology at the University of Washington and lead author on the study, told BuzzFeed News.

Adherence is also a big issue for the only other PrEP on the market, a once-a-day pill called Truvada. Initial trials for the pill showed it led to a 44% decrease in HIV infection rates overall. But it’s now known that, when taken properly, Truvada cuts new cases of HIV by at least 92%. Because of its high effectiveness, the CDC has since recommended that 1 in 4 gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of HIV.

The ring adds a new HIV prevention tool, which some experts say will be particularly useful in African countries where women are at highest risk for HIV infection. More than half of the 35 million people living with HIV worldwide are women, and the vast majority live in sub-Saharan Africa.

“A prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly, a woman would have control over it, and it could allow her to keep herself safe from HIV without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies,” Baeten said. “That individual control of prevention is so powerful.”

The dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade, and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents HIV transmission. Still, experts caution that the ring should not be a woman’s sole source of protection.

“There is absolute reason to celebrate. But 27% is a lower number than any of us would like to see,” Mitchell Warren, executive director of AVAC, a global HIV-prevention advocacy group, told BuzzFeed News.

“We obviously always want higher numbers. But 1 in 3 infections were prevented overall — and that’s huge.”

Warren noted that other rings with antiretrovirals are also being developed, as well as rings that could offer multipurpose protection, against not only HIV but pregnancy.

Like birth control, the more types of HIV prevention, the better, experts say.

“For some women, a pill every day might work really well. For others, that may be not achievable,” Baeten said. “Pills and rings should be sitting next to each other as options.”",1
"Ten-year-old Mallory Oakes loves to read – in fact, she has been doing it since before she was 2 years old. Her mother knew she had a gifted child, but those gifts would not come without challenges.

“I think I knew from very early on that she was different, but she was my first child, so I figured anything that I saw, there was a chance that she would grow out of it,” Amy Oakes told FoxNews.com. “She would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age, she stopped napping around 15 months … any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum.”

Oakes didn’t know it then, but her daughter Mallory was one of more than 10 percent of American children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)

“She was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom,” Amy said. “But there were other components to it -- there was oppositional defiant disorder, there were some [autism] spectrum-like behaviors, and difficulty later on socializing with other children.”

Oppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to ADHD in children and is characterized by anger, tantrums, opposition to authority and, sometimes, aggressive behavior.

For Mallory, the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left Amy reeling— and willing to try anything to control them.

“Initially, I tried a number of different things -- different kinds of therapies; art therapies. I took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch,” she said. “We tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us, and making matters worse.”

Medication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with ADD and ADHD, with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms. The spectrum of ADHD and related disorders is broad, and there is no one-size-fits-all treatment.

“There were times I remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day, it could be five meltdowns a day,” Amy said. “She couldn't do anything to stop it, and I really began to realize that her brain wouldn't let her, even if she wanted to be good, her brain wasn't allowing her to.”

Mallory’s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in Hoboken, N.J. to the suburb of Glen Rock, N.J. in 2014.

“She wasn't able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end-of-the-road school … in my mind, it was not a place where she belonged,” Amy said.

Desperate for a solution, Amy started searching for success stories about kids like Mallory who had been helped by different therapies. That’s when she found the Brain Balance Achievement Center in Allendale, N.J.

“We went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible,” Amy said. “I thought we weren't going to get accepted to the program, and they told us they could help us and we never looked back.”

The specialized learning centers, of which there are now 80 throughout the country, were developed by Dr. Robert Melillo, a neurology researcher and author of the book “Disconnected Kids,” to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders, like Mallory.

“What thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time,” Melillo told FoxNews.com. “And if [kids] have poor coordination in their body, they often have poor coordination in their brain -- poor coordination between their networks -- so they can't bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way.”

The program uses a combination of sensory motor (physical) exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders.

“If you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain, those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues,” Melillo said. “The easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated, so a large part of what we're doing is this sensory motor interaction, building their muscle tone, building their strength, building their body spatial awareness.”

The program also incorporates what Melillo calls “bionutritional” guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning. Parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with at-home exercises to do with their kids.

Mallory attended the Brain Balance Achievement Center three times a week after school for three months at a time, starting in November 2014. She has since gone on to complete two more cycles of Brain Balance learning and no longer takes medication to manage her condition.

“She's playing on the basketball team now, she's involved in theatre -- things that she wasn't able to do because her behaviors prohibited her from doing them,” Amy said. “I really felt very hopeless, before we found Brain Balance, so the fact that I just have hopes for her now is a beautiful thing, and I think she can do anything she wants to do.”

"(CNN) Jet lag might be the worst part of long-distance travel, especially when it leaves you feeling tired, cranky and off-kilter for days.

But scientists at Stanford University say there may be a way to prevent jet lag without medication or adjusting your sleep schedule.

A team of researchers led by neurobiologist Jamie Zeitzer is working on a technique that exposes people to short flashes of light while they sleep to help them adjust more quickly to time zone changes.

Current light therapy treatment includes sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day, which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip. Zeitzer's latest study, published Monday in the Journal of Clinical Investigation , could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep, before the trip, without changing or interrupting your routine.

Exploiting biology 'in the eye'

Researchers believe the flashing light helps reset the circadian system , which regulates rhythms in the human body and establishes normal sleep and wake phases.

The circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light; it controls sleep timing, hormone release and mood, said Zeitzer, an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences. Jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms.

To adapt to a new time zone, most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination, either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive, Zeitzer said. Or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences; the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day, taking up to three days to catch up.

Through light therapy, the technique Zeitzer is experimenting with, a person's brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone. The treatment ""exploits biology in the eye"" to speed up the brain's adjustment to time changes, he said.

This study builds on previous research published in 2014, which found that light therapy works best at night because the body's circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night, even through closed eyelids. In this latest study, Zeitzer and Raymond Najjar, a former postdoctoral scholar at Stanford now at Singapore Eye Research Institute, found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip.

""The previous study was proof of principle: Can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep?"" Zeitzer said. This time around, researchers tried to further optimize the process.

Continuous light vs. flashes

To determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles, researchers recruited 39 participants ages 19 to 36. They put them on a routine sleep-wake cycle, going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks. They then had the volunteers sleep in the lab, where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour.

They found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light, similar to a camera flash, every 10 seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing, compared with 36 minutes for those exposed to continuous light. Participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking.

""You get more effectiveness out of flashes of light. It will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light, which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment,"" Zeitzer said.

The treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules, he said, but that's a long way off. There's still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public.",1
"Michael Burk found walking increasingly painful last year. Crossing the street and tying his shoes became challenges, and colleagues noticed he was limping at work.

On a recent morning, Mr. Burk reported to the Hospital for Joint Diseases, part of NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, for hip-replacement surgery. His surgeon had promised him a better quality of life, and said both the operation and recovery would be quick.

About an hour later Mr. Burk was out of surgery. By 4 p.m. that afternoon he was upstairs in a ward, walking on crutches down the hall and going up and down a small model staircase. At 6 p.m., he left the hospital and headed home with his wife to Northern New Jersey, where he had a bowl of chicken soup.

Mr. Burk, 54 years old, had what NYU Langone calls same-day hip-replacement surgery, which practitioners say offers faster recovery times and less postoperative pain. With traditional hip surgery, patients typically spend days recovering in the hospital and may need additional time in a rehabilitation center.

Hip replacement, formally known as total hip arthroplasty, is considered one of the most effective surgeries in medicine, enabling the vast majority of patients to walk again pain-free. More than 340,000 of the operations are performed in the U.S. a year and include a growing number of patients in their 40s and 50s who want to maintain an active lifestyle.

The procedure replaces an arthritic or damaged hip joint with an artificial joint. In the traditional surgical method, known as the posterior approach, surgeons cut through muscle, tendons and tissues in the patient’s backside to get to the hip joint. The arthritic joint is removed and a prosthetic joint akin to a ball and socket is implanted, enabling the patient to move with greater ease.

Roy Davidovitch, who operated on Mr. Burk, is one of a growing number of surgeons offering the same-day hip-replacement technique. Dr. Davidovitch, director of NYU Langone’s Hip Center, uses a so-called anterior approach. He makes a four-inch incision in front of the hip, close to the groin, before going in to install the new joint. The procedure is performed through what he calls a “natural interval,” or opening between muscles, thereby avoiding cutting through muscle and tendons as with the posterior approach.

Dr. Davidovitch has performed about 100 same-day hip replacements in the past year. There have been no complications and only one hospital readmission for several hours when a patient reacted to the anesthesia, he says.

Joel Matta, an orthopedic surgeon at Providence Saint John’s Health Center in Santa Monica, Calif., was an early adopter of the method in the U.S. and has performed more than 4,000 anterior hip replacements over the past 20 years. Dr. Matta, who helped train Dr. Davidovitch, designed a special operating table to help surgeons manipulate the patient’s legs and body to improve access to the surgical site.

As many as 26% of member surgeons performing hip replacements in the U.S. use the anterior method, according to a survey by the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons. The technique is considered harder to master partly because the surgeon has less room to maneuver around the joint than with the posterior approach. But some surgical experts say there isn’t sufficient data to assert the technique is superior to traditional methods.

Jay Lieberman, president of the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, says more studies are needed. “We don’t know which is the best approach,” says Dr. Lieberman, who is chairman of orthopedics at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles.

Some doctors question whether it is safe for patients to go home after hip surgery without spending a night being monitored in a hospital. “We should be careful,” says Vincent Pellegrini, orthopedics chair at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. “It is still a big operation.”

Some research gives anterior hip replacement procedures a slight edge over the traditional technique. “Is it the cat’s meow? The answer is, somewhat,” says Jose Rodriguez, vice chairman of orthopedics at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, a part of Northwell Health, who has published studies comparing the different surgical approaches. “There is less muscle injury” and a patient’s early recovery is “definitely better,” says Dr. Rodriguez, who favors the anterior method in his own practice.

Although more patients getting anterior surgery are able to perform physical tasks more quickly, those receiving traditional surgery catch up after about six weeks. At that point “there is no difference” in how patients fare, Dr. Rodriguez says.

Most patients fully recover from hip replacement after about three to six months regardless of surgical approach, doctors say. By then, the bone has largely grown over the implant and it is safely affixed.

Anterior hip replacement patients often need less pain medication after surgery, practitioners of the technique say, although this varies by the individual. Other surgeons disagree, saying pain levels depend on pain management, not surgical approach.

Before getting same-day hip-replacement surgery at NYU in January, Barbara Ross, of Suffern, N.Y., was in near-constant, severe pain, she says. The day after the procedure she took “one or two Vicodins,” a narcotic painkiller, and since then, “absolutely nothing,” she says. “I am 100% better than I have been in years.” Ms. Ross, 62, is back at work running her public relations firm.

Multiple departments had to be on board when NYU launched its same-day hip-replacement program in 2015, including the chairman of orthopedics, Joseph Zuckerman. Dr. Zuckerman says he now wants to expand same-day hip replacement surgery to other approaches and other joints. The hospital has spent nearly $200,000 over the years on two special operating tables for the surgery.

Dr. Davidovitch says he needed a shorter-lasting anesthesia that would let patients get out of bed and walk the same afternoon. Mitchell Marshall, chief of anesthesiology for the Hospital for Joint Diseases, says his division was enthusiastic, but needed to make sure it could be done safely. The outcome: A spinal anesthetic that lasts 90 minutes, as opposed to the more than three-hour anesthesia standard for traditional hip surgery.

“At first, there was a lot of anxiety,” recalls nurse manager Ella Blot. “But we would see [patients] going home and we’d say, amazing.” To Ms. Blot, a 23-year nursing veteran, “the world has changed. They used to stay here two weeks, then 10 days, seven days, suddenly four days, two days” after hip-replacement surgery.

Keith Berend, senior partner at Joint Implant Surgeons in New Albany, Ohio, prefers the anterior approach. “It makes perfect sense that cutting no muscles will result in the fastest recovery,” he says. Still, other partners at the practice use another technique, called the lateral approach, in which the surgeon approaches the hip joint from the side. In all cases, patients at the facility go home the same day, he says.

“The experience of the surgeon, the efficiency of the team and the pain-management protocols” are the most crucial variables that make a same-day operation possible, Dr. Berend says.

Jeffrey Leeds, a 59-year-old private-equity investor in New York City, had same-day hip surgery at NYU in November. He says he was in so much pain before the operation that if he sat on the ground to play with his 2-year-old daughter, he couldn’t stand up.

Pain after the surgery was minimal, he says, and Tylenol was all he needed. Mr. Leeds was back at work within days: “My colleagues were hoping for a slower recovery,” he jokes.

"A Diet High In Fiber May Help Protect Against Breast Cancer

Enlarge this image toggle caption Morgan McCloy/NPR Morgan McCloy/NPR

If the advice to eat more fiber seems easy to ignore, you're not alone. Most Americans don't get the 25 to 38 grams a day that's recommended, depending on age and gender.

But if you're skimping on fiber, the health stakes are high, especially if you're a teenage girl.

A study published Monday in the journal Pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber-rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman's risk of developing breast cancer.

The findings are based on a long-term study of 44,000 women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school. The women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years.

The researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber (28 grams per day, on average) had a 24 percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause, compared with women who ate low levels of fiber (14 grams per day, on average). For the women on the high-fiber diet, the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by 16 percent.

Of course, the idea that high-fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new. It's well-known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water. Prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease. There's also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management.

This new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit.

""This is a really important study ... [suggesting] that the more fiber you eat during your high school years, the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer,"" says Kimberly Blackwell, a breast cancer specialist at the Duke Cancer Center.

In a commentary accompanying the study in Pediatrics, Blackwell writes, ""There is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels."" And this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer.

The authors point to other possible explanations, too. For instance, high-fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity, since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable.

Maryam Farvid, a fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health who is lead author of the study, says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time-sensitive. Adolescence is ""a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important,"" she says.

One limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school. They were in their 30s and 40 when asked, so there could be ""recall bias"" — the women's memories may be foggy.

""The recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned,"" writes Blackwell. On the other hand, she says, ""people's dietary habits don't really change a lot. ... In general, what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life.""

So, how might the message of this new study linking high-fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers?

This is a question Kristi King, a dietitian at Texas Children's Hospital, has thought about a lot.

She says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating. ""Unfortunately for teenagers, they're [into] instant gratification,"" and they're not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health, she says.

But, she says, explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention. ""Most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer,"" says King. ""So I feel like that touches a nerve with them.""

Given the known benefits of high-fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease, the government's Dietary Guidelines for Americans also say most people need to consume more.

Women are advised to consume 25 grams a day. Men are advised to consume 38 grams a day.

So, how best to reach these targets? ""Add fiber at each meal,"" says King, in the form of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, beans, nuts or seeds. Pears are a great bet with 7 grams of fiber apiece.

And check out fiber-rich snacks, like popcorn and edamame.",1
"Eating a high-fiber diet as a teenager, including lots of fruits and vegetables, may be another tool to help women lower their risk for later breast cancer.

A new study looking at diet and health data from more than 44,000 women found that those who reported consuming the highest amount of fiber during high school, about 28 grams a day, had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer before menopause compared with those who said they ate less than 15 grams a day.

The researchers from Harvard's T.H. Chan School of Public Health, whose study appears in the journal Pediatrics, analyzed data from a large, ongoing, national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women's health.

""The results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high-fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life. High consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence,"" lead author Maryam Farvid, a visiting scientist at Harvard, told CBS News.

The findings showed that breast cancer risk was 12 to 19 percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth, depending on how much more they ate. Eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a 16 percent lower risk of breast cancer overall, and a 24 percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause.

Farvid said the findings show that each additional 10 grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by 14 percent.

""Having the recommended 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by 30 percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake,"" Farvid said. ""Women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later.""

Eating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial, the researchers said.

Healthy high-fiber food choices include apples, pears, raspberries, artichokes, green peas, broccoli, split peas, lentils, beans, whole wheat pasta, whole grain bread, brown rice, bran flakes, and oatmeal.

Why would these foods have such an impact?

In an accompanying editorial, Duke University Medical Center's Dr. Kimberly Blackwell said there's longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome.

She said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk, and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk.

One weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their 30s and 40s. Nevertheless, Blackwell said, ""It is reasonable for pediatricians to encourage a high-fiber diet and include decreasing breast cancer risk as one of the potential benefits.""

Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital, in New York, told CBS News, ""It lends support to the fact that we need to encourage people to start healthy habits earlier on.""

Dr. Deanna Attai, assistant clinical professor of surgery at the David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California Los Angeles, said that while it's an observational study, not a clinical intervention, its larger point about diet and health is important.

""The sexy headline is eat this and you'll have a lower risk of breast cancer, but I'd shift the focus to, eat more fiber because it's better for you and you'll be a healthier person and you're less likely to be obese and have chronic inflammation and other things that will reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer along the way,"" said Attai.

She added, ""The message is a good one as far as increasing fiber, but it also has to be put in perspective. This is just one mechanism by which we can reduce risk and it does warrant further study.""",1

Hughes, chief executive of Zafgen, said the Boston company will use the data to prepare a “risk-mitigation” plan to help persuade the Food and Drug Administration to lift its so-called clinical hold on the late-stage trial, allowing it to resume. But he conceded that Zafgen, which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate, Beloranib, as early as 2016, will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for FDA approval.

Zafgen Inc. is set Wednesday to release findings of a clinical trial showing many patients taking its experimental obesity treatment lost weight and engaged in less binge-eating, pointing to a way forward for a drug program halted by regulators last year after the deaths of two patients.

“We’re delighted with the results,” Hughes said in an interview. “This is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population. Our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety.”

The clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators: whether Beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year. Zafgen has lost more than 80 percent of its stock value since the week in October when the first death was made public.

Many patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome, the rare condition Beloranib treats, are prone to blood-clotting and other diseases. Hughes said Zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk-mitigation plan, and address it in discussions with FDA officials.

“As of today, we have no evidence to suggest that Beloranib by itself can cause blood clots,” Hughes said. “This is a patient population that’s at risk for thrombotic [clotting] issues.”

Zafgen said its six-month study involving 107 patients suffering from Prader-Willi syndrome met its two primary goals, known as end points: showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia-related behavior, meaning excessive eating.

While the FDA’s clinical hold prevented Zafgen from completing its trial, Dennis D. Kim, the company’s chief medical officer, said it was largely finished. Sixty-eight of the enrolled patients completed the study, Kim said, while 27 other patients completed 20 of the trial’s scheduled 26 weeks. A small number of other patients withdrew early.

Zafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of 14 US trial sites they were taking the drug. Some analysts have suggested the FDA might approve the drug, despite the adverse events, if Zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients.

There are currently no treatments for Prader-Willi syndrome, the most common genetic cause of life-threatening obesity. Prader-Willi affects an estimated 6,000 to 8,000 Americans.

It can dominate the lives of patients and their families, leading to excessive overeating, choking, and stomach rupture, along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders.

Average life expectancy of Prader-Willi syndrome patients is 32 years.

“The efficacy of Beloranib looks very promising,” said Dr. Merlin G. Butler, director of research and genetics at the University of Kansas Medical Center in Kansas City, Kan., and a principal investigator for the clinical trial there. “We’ve seen individuals who have lost significant amounts of weight in the six-month period. We think the drug must at least diminish the food-seeking drive, which correlates to an increased caloric intake in patients.”

Zafgen, founded in 2005, is backed by investors that include venture capital firms Atlas Venture of Cambridge and Third Rock Ventures of Boston. The company raised $96 million in an initial public offering in 2014, using the money to finance its clinical studies.

Shares of Zafgen, which traded as high as $55.36 on the Nasdaq stock exchange last year, closed Tuesday at $5.62, down nearly 3.3 percent for the day.

"Autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant could help treat certain form of multiple sclerosis, say doctors in Sheffield

A treatment traditionally used on patients with certain cancers is being tried on a small number of people with multiple sclerosis with “remarkable results”, according to a professor involved in the research.

The treatment destroys patients’ faulty immune systems through chemotherapy and then rebuilds them using stem cells previously harvested from their blood.

Doctors at Royal Hallamshire hospital in Sheffield stress that the treatment, so far given to about 20 patients over three years, is not suitable for everyone with the disease, which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal column.

The hospital is part of an international trial also involving patients in the US, Sweden and Brazil to see whether the treatment can benefit those with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis, a form that involves flare-ups of symptoms such as loss of vision, fatigue, muscle problems and difficulties with balance that can last from a few days to a few months.

These will be followed by periods where symptoms are mild or disappear altogether.

Multiple sclerosis experts call for end to 'wait and see' approach to treatment Read more

Most people with MS – there are thought to be more than 100,000 in the UK – are diagnosed with this form, and although drugs may help slow progression, there is currently no cure.

Consultant hematologist John Snowden said: “The immune system is being reset or rebooted back to a time point before it caused MS ... The treatment has traditionally been used to treat bone and blood cancers.”

Basil Sharrack, a consultant neurologist at Sheffield teaching hospitals NHS foundation trust, said: “The new treatment is showing some remarkable results in the small number of patients we have treated so far.

“It is important to stress, however, that this treatment is only suitable for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis disease who have had two or more significant relapses in the past 12 months, failed to respond to standard drug treatment and who have had the illness for at least 10 years.”

One patient who has undergone the treatment, known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT), told the BBC’s Panorama programme that he had made incredible progress.

Steven Storey, who was diagnosed with MS in 2013, said: “I went from running marathons to needing 24-hour acute care. At one point, I couldn’t even hold a spoon and feed myself.”

Within a few days of the transplant, he was able to move his toes, and after four months could stand unaided, although he still needs a wheelchair. “It’s been incredible,” Storey said. “I was in a dire place, but now I can swim and cycle and I am determined to walk.”

Holly Drewry was 21 when she was diagnosed with MS, and her condition deteriorated after she gave birth to her daughter, Isla. “Within a couple of months I got worse and worse,” she said. “I couldn’t dress or wash myself; I didn’t even have the strength to carry my daughter.”

She had needed a wheelchair before her transplant, but after the treatment she walked out of hospital. Drewry, whose MS is described by doctors as “dormant”, said: “It’s been a miracle. I got my life and my independence back and the future is bright again in terms of being a mum and doing everything with Isla.”

Two years after the treatment, she has had no relapses and there was no evidence of active disease on her scans.

Paul Kirkham, another patient who has undergone the treatment at a cost of about £30,000, said: “It does knock you out. I’d rather have done 10 rounds with Mike Tyson.”

Richard Burt of Northwestern University in Chicago, who carried out the first HSCT for MS in 1995 and is coordinating the international trials, told the BBC: “There has been resistance to this in the pharma[ceutical] and academic world. This is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing.”

Emma Gray, the head of clinical trials at the MS Society, said: “Ongoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as HSCT could offer hope, and it’s clear that in the cases highlighted by Panorama, they’ve had a life-changing impact.

“However, trials have found that while HSCT may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with MS, it may not be effective for all types of the condition.

“We want people to be aware that HSCT is an aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks. It needs to be carried out at an accredited centre or as part of a clinical trial.

“The MS Society has recently funded a study looking into the impact of HSCT on the immune system and we’d like to see larger trials in this area. They would help us learn more about the safety and long term effectiveness of the treatment and who could benefit from it.”",1
"It's often prescribed for migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, fever, gout and even post-operative pain. Now, diclofenac could be a contender to help treat cancer.

The Repurposing Drugs in Oncology – ReDO – project published a clinical study this week in ecancermedicalscience that the affordable, generic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – or NSAID – has cancer-fighting properties. While researchers already suspected NSAIDs can help prevent cancer, they're only now beginning to explore the ways that they could actually help treat the disease.

""It's still somewhat surprising that there is still so much we don't understand about how many of the standard drugs we use every day, like diclofenac, work,"" study author Pan Pantziarka, member of the ReDO project and the Anticancer Fund, said in a press release. ""But the more we learn, the more we can see that these drugs are multi-targeted agents with interesting and useful effects on multiple pathways of interest in oncology.""

Pantziarka and colleagues report that diclofenac may improve the immune system, the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation and the development of blood vessels. Previous studies have shown that the drug could reduce tumor size in fibrosarcoma, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer and several other cancers, according to the press release.

Treating cancer patients with diclofenac after surgery could also be beneficial, the authors wrote in the study. ""After all, it's ​metastatic disease that most often kills patients, not the original primary disease,"" Pantziarka said in the release.",1
"Australian researchers found the greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced, the higher the hair cortisol concentrations

Hair samples may help determine the risk of a child developing mental and other chronic illnesses later in their life, research led by the University of Melbourne has found.

Researchers assessed the level of cortisol in the hair of 70 nine-year-old children from primary schools across Victoria. Cortisol is known as the “stress hormone” because it is released in response to acute stress to help the body react and cope.

The greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced, such as divorce, injury, moving house, severe illness or the death of a family member, the higher the hair cortisol concentrations were, the researchers found.

Parents – talk to your kids about mental health. Even if it's awkward | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more

It suggests hair cortisol levels may provide a marker of trauma exposure in children and identify those at risk of developing psychosocial and behavioural problems, and who may need medical and psychological support, leader of the study and a fellow in child and adolescent mental health at the University of Melbourne, Dr Julian Simmons, said.

“Childhood is an imperative and sensitive period of development, and when things go wrong it can have lifelong consequences, not just on mental health, but also on general health,” Simmons said.

“What’s less commonly understood is that beyond poor mental health, it can also be associated with the development of other illnesses such as diabetes, obesity and cholesterol issues, because cortisol is also central to glucose availability, blood pressure and immune function, so identifying these children is important.”

While blood or saliva tests could be used to detect cortisol levels, these methods were sometimes problematic, especially in children, Simmons said. Cortisol levels fluctuate during the day meaning results were not always accurate, and only revealed cortisol levels at a single point in time.

The tests could also be unpleasant and invasive for children, given blood tests require a needle and saliva tests require the child to fast beforehand.

“However, hair samples are not only easier to obtain, but provide us with a picture of total cortisol throughout the system across many months rather than just at a point in time,” Simmons said.

“Looking at hair tells us new things.”

The research is part of the ongoing Murdoch Childrens Research Institute’s Childhood to Adolescence Study following a cohort of 1,200 children in and around Melbourne and was published in the journal, Psychoneuroendocrinology.

Simmons said the results did not mean all children with elevated cortisol levels would go on to develop behavioural problems or mental illness, with many other social, environmental and genetic factors also involved.

But it did reveal it was important to further study hormones and the body’s endocrine system, and how they relate to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression, he said.

“We hope this can be used as one of the tools to identify children at risk,” he said.",1

TUESDAY, Jan. 5, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- For the sixth year in a row, a panel of health experts has named the heart-healthy DASH diet the best overall eating plan, according to U.S. News & World Report's 2016 Best Diets ranking.

The DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet was designed to lower blood pressure and cholesterol levels by limiting fats, red meat and sugar in favor of healthy grains, poultry, low-fat dairy and nuts, the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute says.

""Our rankings put hard numbers on the belief that no one diet is ideal for everybody, but the best food plans overall are sustainable,"" Angela Haupt, senior health editor at U.S. News & World Report, said in a news release from the media company.

Every year, U.S. News & World Report asks experts to rank various diets to help the tens of millions of dieters in the United States and around the globe make informed dietary decisions that can help them achieve healthier lifestyles.

The panel of experts -- including nutritionists and doctors specializing in diabetes, heart health and weight loss -- scored each diet for short-term and long-term weight loss. They also considered how easy each diet was to follow, as well as safety and nutritional value.

""Besides the rankings and data, each diet has a detailed profile that includes how it works, evidence that supports or refutes its claims and a nutritional snapshot -- tools that, along with the advice of a physician or nutritionist, can help consumers invest in diets that suit their lifestyles and further their health and wellness goals,"" Haupt said.

The panel evaluated 38 of the most popular or trendy diets this year. After ranking them in nine categories, the experts found the MIND diet tied for second place for best overall diet with the cholesterol-lowering TLC diet. The MIND diet includes some features of the DASH diet and Mediterranean diet, such as high consumption of fruits, vegetables and fish, but focuses on foods that promote brain health.

The MIND diet ranked first in the ""Easiest Diet to Follow"" category in a three-way tie with Weight Watchers and the Fertility diet, which asserts that certain dietary changes can boost fertility.

The Fertility diet, which calls for the elimination of trans fats, also ranked as the best diet for diabetes, the report revealed. The Biggest Loser diet and the DASH diet came in second and third, respectively, in the diabetes category.

The DASH diet scored highest when it comes to healthy eating, followed by the TLC diet. The Mediterranean and the MIND diet tied for third place in this category.

The Weight Watchers diet ranked highest out of all weight-loss diets but tied with the Mayo Clinic diet as the ""Best Commercial Diet.""

When it comes to speedy weight loss, the HMR program and Biggest Loser diet shared the top ranking, followed by the Atkins diet in second place and Weight Watchers in third.

On the opposite end of the list, the Whole30 diet -- a 30-day program that bans processed foods, legumes, grains, dairy, alcohol and added sugar -- ranked as the worst overall diet on the list, the new report said.

The Raw Food diet and low-carb Atkins diet also scored poorly overall and ranked low in categories like ""Best Diets for Healthy Eating."" The Raw Food diet was also considered the most difficult diet to follow, though it was one of the top ranked weight-loss diets, the panel found.

MONDAY, Jan. 4, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- Newer blood pressure drugs are as safe and effective as older medications, new research suggests.

Scientists at the NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City said their findings settle a longstanding debate about which of two types blood-pressure lowering medications studied are better.

An analysis of 106 randomized trials involving more than 250,000 patients examined the effects of newer angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs) and older angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors. Although ACE inhibitors were developed 10 years earlier, both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis, challenging previous findings that suggest ACE inhibitors have greater benefits.

According to the new analysis, published online Jan. 4 in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings, the only difference between the medications is that ARBs are more easily tolerated.

""There has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ACE inhibitors compared to ARBs, with many of them using an 'ACE inhibitor-first' approach, with ARBs regarded as less effective,"" study author Dr. Sripal Bangalore said in a medical center news release.

""We believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients,"" added Bangalore, an associate professor in the division of cardiology, in the department of medicine at NYU Langone.

Both ARBs and ACE inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin II, which regulates blood pressure, but they do this in different ways, the study authors said.

Angiotensin II restricts blood flow through vessels, raising blood pressure. ACE inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin II, while ARBs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels, the researchers explained.

Previous studies have suggested that older ACE inhibitors are more effective than ARBs. But, this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs, greater emphasis on quitting smoking, and wider use of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins.

However, when trials were conducted at similar times, one drug was not more effective than the other, the findings showed.

""This is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ACE inhibitors and ARBs, all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents, except for better tolerability of ARBs,"" Bangalore said.

""The results of our analysis are especially important for patients, given that many ARBs are now also generic, which reduces their costs,"" he added.

"Drinking cow’s milk produced at night may be a treatment for anxiety and insomnia, suggests an animal study in the Journal of Medicinal Food.

A glass of milk at bedtime has long been touted as a sleep aid. But the study found that milk collected at night, or night milk, had enhanced sedative effects in mice compared with milk produced during the day. Night milk significantly decreased the rodents’ physical activity, balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk, the research showed.

Mice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces, an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam, a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people, the researchers said.

Night milk is rich in tryptophan, a sleep-inducing compound, and melatonin, a hormone that regulates the sleep-wake cycle, the study said. Researchers in South Korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow’s milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water. Analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained 24% more tryptophan and nearly 10 times as much melatonin as the day milk. Two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water. The mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments. Mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water-fed controls. Diazepam-treated mice were the least active. Balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a 20-minute period: Mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times, about twice as often as mice given day milk. Diazepam-treated controls fell about nine times, while the water-fed controls fell twice. Caveat: The effects of night milk haven’t been tested on people with sleep problems and anxiety disorders.

"Days after bringing home her newborn twin daughters, Alysia Vaccaro could sense Evangelina wasn't as healthy as her sister.

""I had a baby to compare her to and I just knew, something was wrong with her,"" Vaccaro told CBS News.

Her mother's intuition was right. Testing revealed Evangelina was born with Severe Combined Immunodeficiency, also called SCID or ""bubble baby"" disease.

It's a genetic disorder that leaves the body with a weakened immune system, making infants extremely vulnerable to illness. It affects cells that play important roles in helping the immune system battle bacteria, viruses and fungi that can cause infections. Even the common cold can be deadly.

Symptoms of the disease are frequently first noticed very early in life, as was the case with Evangelina. Babies with SCID often come down with recurrent, severe respiratory infections that can be life threatening, according to the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma and Immunology.

""We wore masks, we had hand sanitizer, we had raw hands from cleaning so much,"" Vaccaro recalled.

The Vaccaros turned to Dr. Donald Kohn at the Broad Stem Cell Research Center at UCLA, where Kohn focuses on the development of new methods to treat genetic diseases of blood cells. They enrolled baby Evangelina in a clinical trial there.

Dr. Kohn said of an experimental treatment for SCID, ""It's gone from a 'one day, maybe' to a real clinical reality.""

That means an actual cure for the disease, said Kohn, who is also director of the Human Gene Medicine Program at UCLA. His treatment involves taking bone marrow from the patient to gather stem cells. A cloned gene is then added to correct what was missing at birth.

""Those stem cells are given back to the patient where they can go back to the bone marrow and make the blood cells for the rest of the patient's life,"" Kohn said.

Evangelina is now 3 and healthy. CBS News

So far, the treatment has restored immune systems in all 23 patients in the most recent clinical trials, including Evangelina.

""It is a cure. I know it's a cure. We're living the cure,"" said Vaccaro.

Now 3 years old, doctors say Evangelina is in perfect health.

Dr. Kohn is currently working with the FDA to make his treatment available nationwide. He's also testing the same method as a cure for sickle cell disease. Clinical trials for that treatment are now underway.",0
"Any woman who is struggling with infertility will tell you that one of the worst parts of going through in vitro fertilization (IVF) are the daily hormone injections. And for some women, those injections could even be downright dangerous.

Although IVF is still considered the gold standard, there’s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope — in vitro maturation (IVM). IVM has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones.

What is IVM?

IVM is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman’s eggs in a lab. Although the treatment is used in conjunction with IVF, the initial process isn’t the same.

With IVF, a woman must undergo between 8 to 11 nights of ovary-stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved. With IVM, women undergo a shorter course— between 3 and 6 days— of hormones known as a “priming phase.”

Once the eggs are retrieved, they’re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days, fertilized and then implanted. They can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later.

Clinics that specialize in IVM require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them, said Dr. Janelle Luk, medical director of Neway Fertility in New York City.

Who is IVM helpful for?

Although IVF is considered the standard of care, experts say some women may benefit from IVM.

For starters, since there is less time involved with IVM, women who are undergoing chemotherapy, radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates.

IVM may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol, a form of estrogen, which elevates as the follicles develop and mature. These would include women with an estrogen-sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots.

IVM can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed IVF, Luk said.

Women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome (OHSS)— which affects between 3 and 6 percent of women who go through IVF— may also benefit from IVM. OHSS can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe OHSS may lead to blood clots, even death, said Dr. Shefali Shastri, a board-certified reproductive endocrinologist and OB/GYN at Reproductive Medicine Associates of New Jersey in Somerset and Short Hills.

More on this... What is ICSI infertility treatment?

What are the limitations of IVM?

A study in the journal Facts, Views and Vision found that IVM achieved up to a 35 percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women, which is comparable to IVF.

Yet most studies have found that IVF is superior to IVM.

Although there are different protocols for IVF, and there aren’t any randomized controlled trials that have compared IVF and IVM side by side, studies that look at standard IVF cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than IVM, Shastri said.

Plus, the American Society for Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) committee opinion on IVM states that implantation rates for IVM—between 5.5 and 21.6 percent— are a more reliable indicator of IVM success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use IVF. They also note that the technology hasn’t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays.

Since IVM results in lower fertilization rates, protocols that use IVM are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI), in which one sperm is injected into one egg. Although ICSI is safe and effective, the bigger concern is if a patient going through IVM doesn’t use ICSI, Shastri said.

While IVM is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take, it may be more costly if several rounds are required.

Although IVM may eventually become more common, IVF still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant.

“With medicine, you always want to optimize a patient’s outcome,” Shastri said. “Ultimately, you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be IVM.”",1
"Story highlights A new study suggests that people who drink a lot of coffee have lower rates of death

Researchers suspect that ingredients in coffee could have direct health benefits

(CNN) Throughout the ages, coffee has been called a virtue and a vice for our health. The latest study comes down in favor of virtue: It says that drinking coffee, whether regular or decaf, could reduce the risk of death.

Researchers started with data from surveys of adults in the United States that asked how much coffee they consumed, as well as other foods and drinks, and then they looked at their rates of death and disease over the following two decades.

The study was large, including more than 200,000 women and 50,000 men.

At first, researchers did not see an obvious relationship between coffee consumption and death rates. Study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 5% to 9% lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee. Those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit. The finding was murky, like previous studies, some of which suggested a benefit and some did not.

But when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked, the relationship became clearer: Those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had 6% to 8% lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers. Those who drank three to five cups and more than five cups had 15% and 12% lower death rates.

"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday it has approved Cotellic, a drug produced by Swiss biotech company Roche, for use in combination with the vemurafenib medication as a treatment for advanced melanoma.

The drugs are intended to target the illness after it has spread to other parts of the body or can’t be removed by surgery.

According to the FDA, Cotellic and vemurafenib, which is marketed under the Zelboraf brand name, prevent or slow cancer cell growth. The drugs affect different parts of the same signaling pathway. The FDA said the safety and efficacy of Cotellic in combination with vemurafenib were shown in a clinical study of 495 patients with previously untreated, advanced melanoma that demonstrate the BRAF V600 mutation. The government agency said that common side effects of the Cotellic and vemurafenib combination was diarrhea, sensitivity to ultraviolet light, nausea, fever and vomiting. Cotellic could also cause “severe” side effects including heart damage, new skin tumors, retinal detachment, skin rash, liver damage and hemorrhage. Cotellic has received orphan drug designation, for which the FDA has provided incentives that include quicker approval, tax benefits for the developer and seven years’ protection from competition after approval. Conventional drugs typically get five years protection. Orphan drugs are defined as experimental treatments for diseases with fewer than 200,000 patients at any one time. Cotellic and Zelboraf are both marketed by California-based Genentech, a member of the Roche Group. Write to Ezequiel Minaya at ezequiel.minaya@wsj.com

"Patient Bonny Hall received chemotherapy for her brain tumor through tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound in a medical first.

Using tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound, Canadian doctors have succeeded in delivering chemotherapy deep inside a cancer patient’s brain.

Proving that the procedure works in people is “a big step forward,” said Dr. Pejman Ghanouni, a radiologist at Stanford University School of Medicine, who was not involved in the research. “It really opens up a lot to the imagination.”

Most drugs are blocked from entering the brain by the “blood-brain barrier,” which protects against infection, but also makes it tricky to treat brain tumors, diseases like Alzheimer’s, and mental illness.

advertisement

Studies in mice, dogs, pigs, and monkeys have shown that so-called focused ultrasound waves can be used to heat tiny bubbles that then mechanically push open gaps in blood vessels, allowing drugs to leak out into the brain. But the procedure had never been done in people.

On Tuesday, Dr. Todd Mainprize, a neurosurgeon at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Centre and the University of Toronto, announced at a news conference that he had successfully breached the blood-brain barrier in a 56-year-old Canadian woman whose brain tumor, diagnosed six years ago, had recently begun to grow.

Mainprize performed the two-and-a-half-hour procedure last Thursday, with the patient, Bonny Hall, inside an MRI scanner. Hall felt nothing from the seconds-long bursts from 1,024 ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull, and an MRI scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed.

The microscopic bubbles — roughly the size of red blood cells — had previously been injected into a vein, along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule.

On Friday, as scheduled, Hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor. No damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain, Mainprize said, and she is recovering well from the surgery.

Because the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain, the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery, Mainprize said. In the trial at Sunnybrook — funded by the Virginia-based Focused Ultrasound Foundation — nine others are slated to receive the same procedure.

Succeeding in getting drugs across the barrier is “a huge achievement” said Dr. Nathan McDannold, a radiologist at Boston’s Brigham and Women’s Hospital, who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat 15 years ago in animals.

But it’s just one of many. New, safe doses of drugs will need to be determined, once medication is not being diverted by the blood-brain barrier, noted Dr. Gordon Li, a neurosurgeon at Stanford. “If we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there,” he said, “it will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials.”

Mainprize said the patient, a “remarkable woman,” was chosen to go first, because of the status and large size of her tumor, because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach, and because of her willingness to help the research.

In a prepared video, Hall said she just wants to get back to living her life. “I want to be a normal housewife … a normal grandma.”",1
"Doctors-in-training face long, stressful hours, sleepless nights and a high risk of depression and suicidal thoughts, but often are too stoic and time-starved to seek help. A study suggests online self-help behavior therapy could be a solution.

Suicidal thoughts were much less common in new doctors who had four half-hour online sessions before starting their first year of training, compared with those who got no therapy.

The research involved about 200 medical interns — residents in their first post-graduate year, which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training. It often involves 80-hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises.

An earlier study of 740 interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four-fold during the first three months of residency, said Dr. Constance Guille of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston. Her research group led both studies.

Sarah Dalechek, a first-year psychiatry resident at that university, said her program requires two month-long rotations of 16-hour overnight shifts in an emergency room. She said she became very depressed but had little time to seek help.

""It's very stressful because you're sleep-deprived, you're not eating right ... you're working back-to-back shifts and you're trying to catch up on sleep but you can't,"" Dalechek said. She was not involved in the study.

Dalechek said she looked into seeing a therapist but would have preferred a web-based program since it's confidential and requires no appointment. Luckily, her depression subsided when that rotation ended.

Guille said offering web-based therapy routinely to medical residents could be beneficial, if her research results are confirmed in a broader study.

The results were published Wednesday in the journal JAMA Psychiatry.

The study involved interns at Yale University and the University of Southern California. It used a free online program developed at the National Institute for Mental Health Research at the Australian National University in Canberra. Interns who got the sessions were 40 percent less likely to have suicidal thoughts during that first year compared to those who received four weekly emails with information about depressions and where to seek help.

The online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective. For example, a poor test grade or bad performance evaluation might lead to feelings of ""I'm not good enough,"" but the lessons encourage more positive thinking about ""how many exams have you passed, to put this failure in a more accurate light,"" Guille said.

The training also encourages seeking out activities or thoughts that bring pleasure, especially when feeling down.

Previous research has shown benefits from similar web-based therapy in other settings.

Guille said medical students and residents tend to be high-achieving perfectionists, but that they need to learn ""you can't always be perfect in medicine, you have to figure out how to deal with failure.""",1
"Approved by the Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday for treating advanced-stage melanoma, the virus — called Imlygic , which was developed in part in a Massachusetts lab — is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors.

Viruses are usually thought of as agents of disease. But for the first time, scientists are poised to bring to the US market a virus that can help thwart cancer, a development that could herald a new age of viral therapies.

In clinical trials, it has helped some cancer patients achieve remission with few of the nasty side effects common to existing treatments. And as the first tumor-killing virus to receive the FDA’s blessing, Imlygic could accelerate the development of other viral therapies.

“This is huge for the whole field, and for cancer patients,” said John Bell, a senior scientist at the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute in Canada. “The field is exploding, and this would be another arrow in the quiver that oncologists use.”

Imlygic is part of a new group of immune-stimulating viral therapies that could change how cancer is treated and managed. One involves a genetically tweaked poliovirus being tested in patients with brain tumors, while another, based on a version of the common cold virus, is now under evaluation in people with bladder cancer.

Melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that kills around 10,000 people per year in the United States. In a trial of 436 patients with the disease, 16 percent of participants who received Imlygic saw their tumors shrink for at least six months, compared with just 2 percent of those who received an older immune-boosting drug. Among those whose cancer had spread locally but not to internal organs, the response rate was better — 33 percent.

“It’s a low-toxicity treatment, and for the right patients you see quite stunning results,” said Robert Coffin, a virologist who created Imlygic at BioVex, the Woburn-based company he founded.

In 2011, the California biotech giant Amgen bought BioVex — and the rights to Imlygic, known generically as talimogene laherparepvec, or T-VEC — in a deal worth up to $1 billion. Amgen will charge patients $65,000 for a course of treatment, which analysts said is in line with expectations.

“These days in oncology we’ve seen some prices quite a bit higher than that,” said Eric Schmidt, an analyst with Cowen & Company. “And Amgen’s not a company that likes to price gouge.”

Schmidt said Imlygic’s market potential as a standalone drug is “very, very modest. It’s being developed in combination with other immunotherapies, where we think there’s a little more of a commercial opportunity, but we still need to see more data.”

Imlygic is approved for skin tumors that are inoperable in patients whose cancer has returned following surgery.

Sue Bohlin, a retired small-business owner in Farmingdale, N.J., is one of those patients. She received the viral therapy in early 2011 after conventional treatments failed to eliminate the skin tumors that had spread from her back to her breast.

“The first time I took it, I got a really serious case of the chills and a high fever, but only for six or eight hours,” said Bohlin, now 62. “After that, there were no side effects.”

Such muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach, doctors and patients said. Aside from chills and fever, the other common symptom cited in the study was skin irritation.

Bohlin’s doctors planned to inject each of her tumor sites every two weeks, but after several rounds of treatments more tumors appeared. In a last-ditch effort meant to jump-start Bohlin’s immune system, they injected her on consecutive weeks. The tumors started shrinking in the following weeks, and about three months later they were gone.

“I think we’re on the cusp of potentially curing patients” with these viruses and other immune therapies, said Dr. Howard Kaufman, chief surgical officer of the Rutgers Cancer Institute of New Jersey and a lead researcher on Bohlin’s trial. “But short of that, this might be like diabetes, where we can control it and people live normal lives.”

Imlygic is based on a form of the herpes simplex virus that commonly causes cold sores. It is genetically altered to replicate only in tumor cells while also producing a protein that activates T-cells, the search-and-destroy specialists of the immune system. Those T-cells pick up melanoma cells’ molecular scent and hunt them down before going off in search of tumor cells hiding elsewhere in the body.

“This wakes up the immune system and says, ‘Hey! Active infection here, come check this out!’ ” said Dr. Antonio Chiocca, chairman of neurosurgery at Brigham and Women’s Hospital.

In many of the newer experiments, researchers are combining cancer-killing viruses like Imlygic with other immune-activating agents known as checkpoint inhibitors. These therapies typically open gateways that tumors have used to block immune cells.

In one small study of 19 advanced melanoma patients treated with both Imlygic and a checkpoint inhibitor called Yervoy, nearly half of the patients responded. “It’s nothing short of dramatic,” said Dr. Jason Chesney, an oncologist at the University of Louisville, who is involved in running a larger, follow-up study of this combination approach.

John O’Donnell, a retired math teacher in Piscataway, N.J., was one of those who tried the combination therapy, but ultimately responded only to Imlygic. More than 20 years ago, a dermatologist told him not to worry about the two tan, irregularly shaped spots near his clavicle. Three years ago, however, he noticed a small raised area on one of them.

Surgeons removed the melanoma, but it returned last year under his arm and in his lung. O’Donnell, who is 67, started the combination therapy shortly thereafter, then stopped taking Yervoy after developing severe diarrhea, a common side effect of the treatment.

But he kept with the Imlygic, and the lung tumors soon disappeared. The nodule under his arm also grew small enough to be removed by surgery.

Through it all, O’Donnell remained healthy enough to achieve one of his primary goals: to continue to lead Tuesday Bingo night at a local senior center without the residents discovering his condition.

“I know it sounds vain, but I’m too visible, and I’m too close to them,” he said. “They’re old and easily upset, and I can’t look sick.”

Earlier this month, a new scan revealed shadows that could be signs of melanoma. “My doctor isn’t convinced, though, so she said we’ll just sit and wait,” O’Donnell said. “Even if it is something, there are other things to try.”

(Reuters) - Merck & Co’s approved Keytruda lung cancer treatment provided superior overall survival to chemotherapy in a late-stage study of patients with advanced disease whose tumors produce a protein called PD-L1 associated with increased risk of the disease.

The U.S. drugmaker on Monday said patients taking the approved 2 milligram dosage of Keytruda and those taking an experimental 10 milligram dose had longer overall survival compared with those taking docetaxel, a standard treatment for non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), the most common form of lung cancer. Keytruda thereby met its main goal of the study.

Patients whose tumors had especially high levels of PD-L1 also went longer without a progression of disease than those taking docetaxel, Merck said. Those whose tumors expressed PD-L1, but not at high levels, did not show such a statistically significant benefit in progression-free survival.

Safety of Keytruda was consistent with what had been seen in previous trials among lung cancer patients, Merck said in a release that included only summary “topline” information from the results.

More detailed data from the study will be provided soon, Merck said, adding that it will ask the U.S. Food and Drug Administration later this year to add the new data to the drug’s package insert label.

U.S. regulators in October approved Keytruda on an accelerated basis for patients with advanced non-small cell lung cancer whose tumors produce PD-L1. The approval was contingent on the company providing more detailed data in the future on Keytruda’s safety and effectiveness.

Keytruda and a similar treatment from Bristol-Myers Squibb Co called Opdivo are antibodies designed to block the interaction between PD-L1 and another protein, PD-1, whose natural function is to put checks on the immune system. By blocking the interaction, the drugs aim to enable the patient’s own immune system to recognize and therefore attack the cancer.

"Portable gluten tester from 6SensorLabs. 6SensorLabs

Restaurants, office parties, potlucks, meals while traveling -- they're a minefield for people with celiac disease and gluten sensitivity who can suffer from stomach pain and upset, swollen joints, and other debilitating health problems when they ingest even a little bit of gluten.

The maker of a new handheld gluten-detecting device hopes to help make eating outside of a gluten-sensitive individual's own kitchen safer and easier.

The company, 6SensorLabs, has started taking pre-orders for the device it calls Nima, which can test food for gluten and get rapid results, said co-founder and chief technology officer Scott Sundvor.

Nima is not FDA-approved and it's not intended for medical use, but the company intends it as a ""consumer"" tool to use when dining out, Sundvor said.

""One of the things that we wanted to make sure we distinguish is that we don't see ourselves as a medical device,"" Sundvor told CBS News. ""So we do not need FDA clearance for the device because we are not using it to diagnose or manage disease. We're simply providing a product to help people know what's in their food and guide their habits.""

Gluten-free diners can place a sample of food into a capsule or ""test pod"" and then insert the capsule into a black, triangular device that basically acts like a mini chemistry test. In about two minutes, Sundvor said Nima can tell if the food sample has 20 parts per million or more of gluten. A smiley face means it's OK; a frowning face means it doesn't pass muster.

As a point of reference, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires manufacturers who choose to put a ""gluten free"" label on food packaging to meet the same 20 parts per million of gluten standard.

Gluten is a protein found in wheat, barley, and rye. People with celiac disease experience an immune reaction when they eat gluten that can lead to intestinal damage and impact the health of other organs if it's not managed well. It can cause stomach pain, a swollen belly, acid reflux, diarrhea, skin problems, and other symptoms.

The National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases estimates that about 1 in 141 Americans has celiac disease, but many people don't know they have the condition. Gluten-sensitive people experience similar symptoms to those with celiac disease and improve when they eliminate gluten from their diets.

Nima is triangular and relatively dainty, about three and a half inches tall by three inches wide, and a little less than an inch thick. ""Small enough to fit into your pocket along with your keys and mobile phone or a small clutch,"" said Sundvor.

Nima was first conceived when Sundvor and company co-founder Shireen Yates met about two years ago and realized they both had gluten intolerance and other food issues.

""We met at MIT through mutual friends. She was getting her MBA and I'd gotten my engineering degree from there. We had this shared experience; Shireen has several food allergies and I also have several food intolerances. We both just had these issues where we'd eat out and get sick or feel uncomfortable,"" Sundvor said. ""Shireen had the idea, 'Why can't I just test my food and figure out what's in it?' So we started talking about the idea and we researched the market and realized it's something we could make happen.""

It costs $179 to pre-order a tester plus three one-time-use pods, and $47.95 for a refill pack of 12 pods; prices will increase later this month, according to the company's website. The company plans to deliver the product by the middle of next year after they've tested it more thoroughly, Sundvor.

Marilyn Grunzweig Geller, chief executive officer of the Celiac Disease Foundation, said she is not familiar with the new gluten-sensing device and was unable to comment on it directly.

""Certainly an FDA-approved device that could help people determine if they were accidentally ingesting gluten could go a long way to helping people and would be useful."" However, she adds, ""I would never comment on a device that's not FDA-approved.""

She said she's anecdotally aware of a number of ""treatments"" for celiac disease and has heard of gluten sensors, but is skeptical.

As for Nima, Sundvor said, ""We're doing a huge amount of testing and one thing we want to be sure of before we start shipping is that we're 99.9 percent accurate.""

He said they have received Nima prototypes and he and his girlfriend, who has celiac disease, are already trying it out.

The company also aims to create similar versions that could test for peanut and dairy allergens, among other problematic ingredients. A Nima app is in the works, too, that he says will let users share information about restaurants and log their results.",1
"People with Type 2 diabetes get an earful of grim lectures about their health prospects and endure much hardship to manage their condition well. But new research offers those who do so a rare reward. A glass of wine every day not only won’t hurt, says a new study: It can actually improve cardiac health, help manage cholesterol and foster better sleep.

The new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, found that compared with a nightly glass of mineral water, a single glass of wine--red or white--offered those with well-managed Type 2 diabetes some benefits.

After two years, those who drank a glass of white wine nightly improved their triglyceride levels compared with those who drank water or red wine.

See the most-read stories in Science this hour >>

But red wine’s benefits were far more numerous and more pronounced than those of white wine: Ruby-colored varietals significantly increased participants’ HDL cholesterol--the “good” form of cholesterol that protects against heart disease--by nearly 10% and improved the overall cholesterol profiles of those who got it. Red wine drinkers also saw improvements in their apolipoprotein a1 levels--a measure of lipid metabolism.

Compared with study participants who drank mineral water nightly and those who had a glass of white wine, diabetics who drank a glass of red wine nightly also had fewer symptoms of metabolic syndrome (hypertension, excess abdominal fat, high blood sugar and abnormal cholesterol levels) at the end of two years.

In people without disease, many studies have found that those who consume alcohol in moderation enjoy better health than those who do not consume any alcohol. Many researchers see that effect as an incidental benefit of alcohol itself, and the authors of the latest study set out believing the same.

But in the current study, the superiority of red wine over white wine in improving diabetes patients’ health suggests that alcohol is not the only thing at work here. While red and white wine contain roughly similar levels of alcohol per serving, red wine contains seven times more plant-based phenolic compounds (including resveratrol and quercetin) than does white wine.

Many researchers argue that it would take dozens of bottles of wine a day--hardly moderate consumption--to deliver polyphenols in volumes that could make a difference in health. But the authors of the current study said that future research should explore whether even the modest phenolic concentrations found in a single glass of red wine might offer measurable health benefits.

The American Diabetes Assn. leaves it to individuals to decide whether to consume alcohol in moderation. But many physicians caution those with diabetes about alcohol consumption, which can add calories, complicate glycemic control and derail self-discipline.

The latest study, conducted by researchers in Israel, Sweden, Germany and the United States, is the first randomized control trial to explore the effect of moderate wine consumption--no more than a single five-ounce serving per day--with alcohol abstention over a lengthy period.

Study participants were all alcohol abstainers at the outset of the study. And all maintained a Mediterranean-style diet throughout their participation, ensuring that the consumption of red wine, white wine or mineral water was the principal difference in their diets.

Genetic inheritance also influenced whether and to what extent wine consumption helped. Carriers of a genetic variation that made them slow metabolizers of alcohol saw considerable improvements in their glycemic control when they consumed a glass of red or white wine daily, the study showed. Participants whose genetic profiles identified them as fast ethanol metabolizers saw no such benefit.

"Here's another reason to snack on dried fruit. Researchers have announced that people who eat dried plums as part of a regular diet can reduce their risk for developing colon cancer.

This discovery was made by researchers at Texas A&M University and the University of North Carolina, and presented at the 2015 Experimental Biology conference in Boston.

""Through our research, we were able to show that dried plums promote retention of beneficial bacteria throughout the colon, and by doing so they may reduce the risk of colon cancer,"" Nancy Turner, study author and professor in the nutrition and food science department of Texas A&M University, said in a press release.

Turner and colleagues examined how dried plums' antioxidants neutralized the type of changes that occur when cancerous cells damage the DNA. They found that when rats were fed a controlled diet of dried plums, two major phyla of bacteria in the gut – Bacteroidetes and Frimicutes – increased, without negatively impacting other areas of the colon.

They also observed that those who were on the dried plum diet showed reduced numbers of aberrant crypts, which are early signs of precancerous lesions considered to be a red flag for future cancer.

""From this study we were able to conclude that dried plums did, in fact, appear to promote retention of beneficial microbiota and microbial metabolism throughout the colon, which was associated with a reduced incidence of precancerous lesions,"" Turner said in the release.

"Club Drug Ketamine Gains Traction As A Treatment For Depression

Enlarge this image Stefano Bianchetti/Corbis Stefano Bianchetti/Corbis

A mind-altering drug called ketamine is changing the way some doctors treat depression.

Encouraged by research showing that ketamine can relieve even the worst depression in a matter of hours, these doctors are giving the drug to some of their toughest patients. And they're doing this even though ketamine lacks approval from the Food and Drug Administration for treating depression.

""It became clear to me that the future of psychiatry was going to include ketamine or derivatives of ketamine,"" says David Feifel, a professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego, who began administering the drug to patients in 2010.

Ketamine was developed as an anesthetic and received FDA approval for this use in 1970. Decades later, it became popular as a psychedelic club drug. And in 2006, a team from the National Institute of Mental Health published a landmark study showing that a single intravenous dose of ketamine produced ""robust and rapid antidepressant effects"" within a couple of hours.

Since then, thousands of depressed patients have received ""off-label"" treatment with ketamine.

One of those patients is Paul, 36, who lives in San Diego and is a patient of Dr. Feifel. We're not using his last name to protect his medical privacy.

Paul's depression began with anxiety. ""I was an extremely anxious child,"" he says. ""I would always make choices based on fear. My life was really directed by what was the least fearful thing that I could do.""

As Paul grew up, his extreme anxiety led to major depression, which could leave him unable to get out of bed for days. ""I lived in pain,"" he says.

Paul managed to get through college and a stint in the Peace Corps. But most days were a struggle. And Paul has spent much of his adult life searching for a treatment that would give him some relief.

He tried just about every drug used for depression, as well as cognitive behavioral therapy, acupuncture, and even electroconvulsive therapy, which induces a brief seizure. But nothing worked — at least not for very long.

Paul says he was increasingly haunted by ""this comforting thought of pressing a cold gun against my forehead where I felt the pain the most.""

Then one day, while investigating depression on the Internet, Paul discovered the research on ketamine. ""It was clear to me that this was real,"" he says.

Ordinarily, there would have been no legal way for Paul to get ketamine. He didn't qualify for most research studies because of his suicidal thoughts. And doctors usually won't prescribe a mind-altering club drug to someone with a mental illness.

But the studies of ketamine have produced results so dramatic that some doctors, including Feifel, are bypassing the usual protocols.

By the time Feifel began hearing about ketamine, he had become frustrated with existing depression drugs. Too often, he says, they just weren't helping his patients.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Courtesy of David Feifel Courtesy of David Feifel

A major study on antidepressant medication published in 2008 seemed to confirm his suspicions. It found that current antidepressants really aren't much better than a placebo.

Many psychiatrists criticized that study. But not Feifel. ""I was kind of like, I'm not surprised,"" he says. ""These really don't seem like powerful tools.""

Feifel remembers feeling ""professionally embarrassed"" that psychiatrists didn't have something better to offer their depressed patients. Something like ketamine.

He knew the drug had risks. It could be abused. It could produce hallucinations. And it didn't have the FDA's OK for treating depression.

But he also knew that doctors had a lot of experience with ketamine. It's been used for decades as an anesthetic that can rapidly stop pain without affecting vital functions like breathing. And ketamine's safety record is so good that it's often the painkiller of choice for children who arrive in the emergency room with a broken bone.

So in 2010, Feifel decided he wanted to offer low doses of the drug to some patients. The decision put him at odds with some prominent psychiatrists, including Tom Insel, director of the National Institute of Mental Health. ""While the science is promising, ketamine is not ready for broad use in the clinic,"" Insel wrote in his blog a few months ago.

""There are a lot of pundits who remain skeptical or feel we need to research this ad infinitum before it's ready, which doesn't make sense to me,"" Feifel says. It's hard to take the wait-and-see approach when you're treating patients who are desperate for help, he adds.

Paul was one of those desperate patients when he was referred to Feifel in March of 2014. The referral was from a local psychiatrist who had run out of ideas, Feifel says.

And Paul jumped at the chance to try ketamine. ""If there was even a 1 percent chance that this worked, it would have been worth it to me,"" he says. ""My life was hanging in the balance.""

And for Paul, the benefits of ketamine became obvious soon after one of his early injections.

""I remember I was in my bathroom and I literally fell to my knees crying because I had no anxiety, I had no depression,"" he says

For the past year, Paul has been getting ketamine every four to six weeks. He feels an altered sense of reality for an hour or two after getting the drug. The effect on depression and anxiety, though, lasts more than a month.

Ketamine doesn't always work that well, Feifel says. After treating more than 100 patients, he's beginning to understand the drug's limitations.

One is that its ability to keep depression at bay can fade pretty quickly. Feifel recalls one patient whose depression would disappear like magic after a dose of ketamine. But ""we could never get it to sustain beyond maybe a day,"" he says.

Also, ketamine treatment is expensive because patients need to be monitored so closely. Feifel charges about $500 for each injection and $1,000 for an intravenous infusion, which takes effect more quickly. Insurers don't cover the cost because the treatment is still considered experimental.

Even so, ketamine clinics are popping up around the country and they have already treated thousands of patients willing and able to pay out of pocket. Some of the clinics are run by psychiatrists. Others have been started by entrepreneurial anesthesiologists and emergency room doctors, who are familiar with ketamine but may not know much about depression.

""We've seen ketamine clinics open up as pure business models,"" Feifel says. ""I'm a little bit concerned about that.""

Feifel fears something bad will happen to a depressed patient at one of these clinics. And that could set back efforts to make the drug more widely available.",1

Agitation and aggression are common in Alzheimer’s patients, and there is no known safe and effective treatment. Now researchers report that a combination drug already in use for treating certain neurological problems may be a better remedy.

Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant commonly found in over-the-counter cough medicines, and quinidine is a drug used to control heart rhythm disorders. In combination, they are used to treat pseudobulbar affect, a neurological disorder involving involuntary crying or other emotional displays.

The scientists randomized 152 Alzheimer’s patients to a 10-week course of dextromethorphan-quinidine and 127 to placebo. Researchers then rated them using a well-validated scale that measures aggression and agitation. The study is in the Sept. 22 issue of JAMA.

Aggression scores declined to 3.8 from 7.1 in the dextromethorphan-quinidine group and to 5.3 from 7.0 in those who took a placebo. Then the researchers re-randomized those who did not respond to placebo to receive either drugs or placebo, and found similar encouraging results for the drug combination.

“Fifty-five percent of the people who were on drugs had a 50 percent reduction in their agitation,” said the lead author, Dr. Jeffrey L. Cummings, director of the Cleveland Clinic Lou Ruvo Center for Brain Health. “That’s a lot when a patient is striking and hitting and cussing. There are no currently approved treatments for agitation, and we’re very enthusiastic about this finding.”",1

"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co’s new Jardiance pill slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack and stroke, a finding that could make it a mainstay diabetes treatment and triple its use, according to researchers and analysts.

Lilly shares jumped as much as 9 percent after data from the trial was released Thursday at a medical meeting in Stockholm.

“This is the first diabetes therapy to show robust effect in reducing cardiovascular death. It really is big news,” said Dr. Bernard Zinman, director of the Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who led the three-year study of 7,000 people.

Because about one-half of the deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, reducing cardiovascular risk is considered essential to diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is linked to obesity.

Jardiance, a once-a-day pill which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson’s Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc’s Farxiga. They lower blood sugar by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys.

Jardiance was developed jointly with Germany’s privately held Boehringer Ingelheim.

Zinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events.

About 26 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, according to federal data for 2014. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said.

“The big news here is that the drug reduced cardiovascular stuff. That has not been the case with all things in diabetes,” said David Marrero, president of health care and education at the American Diabetes Association. “It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that.”

JARDIANCE COULD BOOST EARNINGS

Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. He cut his 2020 sales forecast for Merck & Co Inc’s Januvia, the leading member of a competing class of oral diabetes drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors, to $6 billion from $7.8 billion.

Anderson estimates Jardiance could boost Lilly’s earnings per share by 8 percent on average across 2016 to 2020.

In the study, patients taking Jardiance had a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular death, including from heart attacks and strokes. There was no significant difference in non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes.

Those taking Jardiance had a 32 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 35 percent lower rate of hospitalizations from heart failure.

The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said.

“This is a wonderful thing,” said Dr. Jerome Tolbert of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data.

Zinman noted that Jardiance, like other SGLT2 drugs, causes weight loss and reduced blood pressure, besides lowering both blood sugar levels and body fat, and also reduces swelling, which all help the cardiovascular system.

Lilly and Boehringer last month disclosed that Jardiance met its primary study goal, becoming the first diabetes drug to show heart-protective results in a large cardiovascular trial. But they did not unveil detailed data until Thursday at the medical meeting.

Shares of Lily closed up 6.5 percent at $89.98 on Thursday, after rising as high as $92.83.

In calculating the combined number of cardiac deaths, non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal strokes, 14 percent fewer events were seen in patients taking Jardiance in combination with standard treatments, compared with patients who took standard treatments alone, meeting the study’s main goal.

Standard treatments included statins, which lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs.",1
"Correction appended, Sept. 14, 2015

In what the authors describe as the largest and longest study of resveratrol in people with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease, there’s encouraging news that the component, which is found in red wine, grapes and dark chocolate, may keep the disease from progressing.

Dr. R. Scott Turner, professor of neurology and director of the memory disorders program at Georgetown University Medical Center and his team created a purified form of resveratrol, which is being studied in both animal and human studies for preventing age-related conditions such as diabetes and cancer. In a study published in Neurology, he described how they randomly assigned half of a group of 119 men and women to take up to 1,000 mg of resveratrol daily, and the other half to a placebo, for a year. All of the participants had mild or moderate Alzheimer’s disease.

At the end of the year, Turner compared the people’s scores on cognitive tests and assessments of how independent they were in their daily living from the start of the study.

“My nightmare was that nothing would be different from the placebo group, and there would be nothing of interest to talk about,” he says. “But that did not happen. I think resveratrol is an engaging target that’s very interesting and could be pharmacologically manipulated to develop a treatment.”

The resveratrol group showed no change in the levels of a protein that builds up in the brains of Alzheimer’s patients. Turner’s group also measured the protein in spinal fluid and blood, and did not see differences over the year in the resveratrol group. That’s likely because experts believe that as Alzheimer’s progresses, more of the protein plaques form in the brain, and less of the protein is released to the rest of the body.

The resveratrol group also showed smaller brain volume, which in the case of Alzheimer’s is a positive sign, as the disease can cause inflammation and swelling that can interfere with nerve connections.

Even more encouraging, the people who were treated showed slight improvements in their ability to maintain certain daily activities on their own, such dressing and bathing themselves.

How resveratrol may be affecting the Alzheimer’s disease process isn’t clear yet.

Turner says the findings don’t suggest that red wine is a cure for Alzheimer’s. The amounts of resveratrol in the purified doses that the participants took were extremely high and beyond those found on the market currently — around what would be contained in about 1,000 bottles of red wine.

Plus, he says, resveratrol supplements currently available over the counter are “unregulated and we don’t know how much is in it. We need more studies to see if it really does have benefit and then it could be turned into more effective drugs that can better target Alzheimer’s.”

"(Reuters Health) - Many women with severe menopausal symptoms are not being treated for them even though safe, effective remedies are available, a study from Australia suggests.

The findings may be applicable to other countries, too, according to senior author Dr. Susan R. Davis from Monash University in Melbourne.

“From my interactions with colleagues from across the globe, I do not believe that what we have observed is Australian-specific,” she told Reuters Health by email. “The management of menopause has been relatively similar in the UK, the USA and in Australia.”

Up to half of women in menopause experience so-called vasomotor symptoms, such as hot flashes and night sweats. Hormone replacement therapy (HRT), which generally combines estrogen plus progestin, is very effective. But after the initial findings of the Women’s Health Initiative study showed that HRT can increase the risk of breast cancer, stroke and other serious problems, many women stopped using it.

As reported in the journal Menopause, in 2013 and 2014 Davis and her team analyzed survey responses from nearly 1,500 women ages 40 to 65.

Seventeen percent were having moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, and 18 percent reported moderate to severe sexual symptoms.

But most were not receiving any kind of treatment. Only 11 percent reported use of HRT, and less than 1 percent were using any type of therapy that didn’t involve hormones.

The women who did use hormones were mostly taking pills containing estrogen, rather than preparations that are absorbed into the skin and that are potentially safer, the researchers found.

“Extrapolating our findings to 3.7 million Australian women aged 40 to 64 years, we found that 455,000 women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms, with most women (385,000) remaining untreated,” they write.

In addition, very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms. Vaginal dryness is common with menopause and affects sexual functioning. Vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than 5 percent of the women, the authors say.

Why are so few women being treated?

“Overall, there is the uncertainty of women and of doctors as to what the options are, what is and is not safe, and of the safe options - what and how to prescribe them,” Davis said.

There is also, she said, a complete lack of understanding that for most women, these symptoms are not fleeting.

“It isn’t ‘grin and bear it for a few months’ and it will all pass, as many women suffer severe symptoms for five-plus years,” she said. “Women and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long.”

Finally, many women don’t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective, she added.

Dr. Wulf H. Utian, medical director of the North American Menopause Society, agrees that many reasons may underlie the lack of treatment. “It is partly ‘fall out’ from the controversy over hormone therapy,” he told Reuters Health in an email.

But overall, he said, it is a combination of patients not wanting therapy or not having information about it, and also the provider not prescribing it.

The company’s shares were up 25 percent at $5.26 in mid-day trading on heavy volumes.

Shares of BioTime Inc, a company that owns nearly 70 percent of Asterias, were little changed at $3.07.

The therapy, AST OPC-1, is the first product derived from human embryos to be tested on humans.

Its success is a key step toward proving that embryonic stem cell research could cure diseases such as cancer, Parkinson’s and serious health conditions such immune deficiencies, stroke and spinal injuries.

Data showed that the severity of the spinal injury was reduced in the first patient and two other patients were able to resume their rehabilitation programs soon after being injected with the stem cells.

The early study tested the benefits of a smaller dose of 2 million stem cells that are tuned to develop into nerves.

Asterias bought OPC-1 in 2013 from the erstwhile stem cell research leader Geron Corp, which decided to focus on developing cancer drugs.

Geron chose to abandon its stem cell therapy in 2011 after such research got embroiled in the abortion debate, prompting many biotech companies to stay quiet about their research.

Monday’s announcement was the first about the therapy in more than two years.

In an early-stage study conducted by Geron, the therapy showed potential in repairing spinal injury in four of the five patients tested, without any adverse events.

Asterias is looking to show recovery of mobility in four out of every 10 patients treated with OPC-1, compared with two out of 10 achieving the same level of improvement without any treatment, Chief Executive Pedro Lichtinger told Reuters in early August.

Menlo Park, California-based Asterias expects to release complete safety data from the first half of the study later in the year.

Lichtinger said he was confident the data would be positive but was not expecting miracles.

“It is important to know that we do not expect patients to get up and play basketball,” he said. “But we do expect the patients to have significant improvements in mobility.”

TUESDAY, Aug. 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Needles beat pills for treating hot flashes in breast cancer survivors, according to a new trial that compared acupuncture, ""sham"" acupuncture, the medication gabapentin and a placebo pill.

Interestingly, sham acupuncture came in second place for effectiveness, the researchers said.

Furthermore, the effects of acupuncture were ""significant and enduring for hot flashes while gabapentin's effect only happened when a patient was taking the medication,"" said study first author Dr. Jun Mao, an associate professor of family medicine and community health at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.

The study was published Aug. 24 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

Mao and his colleagues tested the treatments in 120 women who were breast cancer survivors. The women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day.

Thirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill, 32 women got sham acupuncture, and 28 women received gabapentin (Neurontin). The drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain.

The women documented their hot flashes in diaries, noting frequency and severity, for 8 weeks of treatment, and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to 24 weeks total. The investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at 8, 12 and 24 weeks.

Acupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at 8 weeks, when all interventions ended, followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin. At 24 weeks, 16 weeks after treatments ended, acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes. But even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at 24 weeks than those who took gabapentin.

""The placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing, as they both seem to persist over time,"" Mao said. ""The magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug.""

The results with the sham acupuncture, which bested gabapentin, suggest that ""there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture,"" said Dr. Gary Deng, interim chief of the integrative medicine service at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. ""There is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure, so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill.""

Deng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment. ""In fact, in clinical practice, every doctor uses it all of the time,"" he said. ""The so-called bedside manner or communication with patients -- all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they're getting something.""

No one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others, said Deng. ""It's like psychotherapy,"" he added. ""Why does it work for some people and not others?"" He suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations, but said ""there is a fertile field for further research.""

Some patients might wonder if acupuncture that's helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause. But Mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common, more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes.

However, Deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels. ""Breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression,"" he said. Menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels.

One big distinction between the two populations, though, is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer. Some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available. For this reason, most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors, Deng explained.

But should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes?

""For patients suffering symptoms, they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what's most appropriate for them,"" Deng said.

"The Ache: The bathroom scale shows how much you’ve gained or lost in pounds, but gives no information about whether the change is fat or muscle.

The Claim: A whole-body scan, called Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry, or DXA for short, gives a detailed snapshot of your body composition, including how your body weight breaks down into fat, bone and lean tissue.

The Verdict: The whole-body scan is highly accurate compared with most other methods for determining body composition, scientists say, and it is useful for tracking progress over time.

Body-mass index, calculated using height and weight, is widely used as a measure of being overweight, but it “doesn’t tell the whole story,” says Steven R. Goldstein, co-director of the Bone Densitometry and Body Composition unit at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York. In an abstract of a 50-person study presented in October at the annual meeting of the North American Menopause Society, researchers found that 18.5% of the women with normal BMI actually had significant excess fat as measured on DXA, making them “skinny fat” people, says Dr. Goldstein, who co-wrote the paper. Also, some women flagged by BMI as overweight actually had normal levels of fat, he says.

For people trying to lose fat and gain muscle through diet, exercise and resistance training, the X-ray scan “takes the guesswork” out figuring how well you’re doing, says Param Dedhia, a physician at Canyon Ranch, a spa in Tucson, Ariz., that offers the scans. Clients typically get the scans between three months and two years apart to measure progress, he says.

A DXA scan (pronounced dexa) is commonly used to measure bone density, but recently has been increasingly used to measure body composition. The scan takes three to 12 minutes, depending on the type of machine and your body size.

The cost, $45 to $350 or more, generally isn’t covered by insurance. It is available at a growing number of spas, hospitals and doctor’s offices, says Tom Webb, global product marketing manager, body-composition, for General Electric Co. ’s GE Healthcare unit, which makes two popular scanners.

After the scan, you get a report with the mass of your bones, fat and lean tissue (including organs and muscle) broken out individually. Your body-fat percentage is also listed and can be compared with reference values for Americans. The report also shows the amount of fat and lean tissue in each body part, such as the right arm or left leg—information that can be helpful for athletes to see if an injured limb is regaining muscle, says John A. Shepherd, director of the Body Composition, Exercise Physiology and Energy Metabolism laboratory at the University of California at San Francisco.

Both of GE’s machines, the Lunar iDXA and Lunar Prodigy, and Hologic’s Horizon DXA estimate how much visceral fat you have, a measure that can help predict risk for diabetes and cardiovascular disease, says Dr. Shepherd, whose lab has received research funding from both companies. (Dr. Shepherd also worked as principal scientist at Hologic from 1996 to 1999 but has no direct financial relationship currently, he says.)

Among methods now available for measuring body composition, DXA “would rank among the top,” says Dympna Gallagher, director of the body composition laboratory at Columbia University Medical Center in New York. It is more accurate than water weighing, long used by researchers to estimate body-fat mass, and more reliable than bioimpedance, a method found on some home scales, and pinching a fold of skin with calipers, she adds.

DXA is reliable when measuring progress over time, Dr. Shepherd says. It is important to use the same model of machine when comparing scans, as results vary slightly among them.

A 2013 study published in the Journal of Clinical Densitometry by researchers at USCF and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found only small differences when the same 600 people were scanned and rescanned between three and 51 days later. For fat mass, for example, the machine was precise within about a pound in either direction.

Scanning too often will show incremental changes and the results won’t be meaningful, says British researcher Susan Hopkins a lecturer in medical imaging at the University of Exeter Medical School.

How often to scan depends on how fast you are making progress. An obese person on a crash diet might see a large change worth measuring fairly soon, for example, while an elderly person slowly building muscle mass through resistance training might progress slowly, and therefore need less frequent scans, Dr. Hopkins says.

DXA scans involve a small amount of radiation, generally between less than 1 and 10 microsieverts, Dr. Shepherd says. That is only a fraction of a chest X-ray, which ranges from 50 to 150 microsieverts, or a mammogram, at about 400, and is about the same as one day of background radiation, he says.

"“Adapting to loss is as much a part of us as grief itself,” said Dr. Shear, who directs the Center for Complicated Grief at the Columbia University School of Social Work. With complicated grief, “something gets in the way of that adaptation,” she said. “Something impedes the course of healing.”

How common is this prolonged grief? An epidemiological study of more than 2,500 people, conducted in Germany in 2009, put the proportion at nearly 7 percent, and at 9 percent among those over age 61.

George A. Bonanno, director of the Loss, Trauma and Emotion Lab at Columbia University Teachers College, said the real figure might be closer to 10 to 15 percent.

Dr. Bonanno, author of “The Other Side of Sadness: What the New Science of Bereavement Tells Us About Life After Loss,” argues that resilience is the typical response to the death of loved ones. Yet, he notes, “we always see a group of people who don’t recover.”

The problem appears more likely when a death is sudden or violent; when the person who died was one’s spouse, romantic partner or child; and when the bereaved person has a history of depression, anxiety or substance abuse.

Defining this sort of grief has engendered some professional disagreement. What criteria distinguish complicated grief from depression or anxiety? When does normal grief become prolonged? Researchers disagree on even the condition’s name.

The American Psychiatric Association, in the latest version of its Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, declined to classify complicated grief as a mental disorder and instead included “persistent complex bereavement-related disorder” in an appendix for further study.",1
"'Play This Video Game And Call Me In The Morning'

I'm driving through a frozen world, where the roads are paved in ice. As I swerve left to avoid a miniature iceberg, a red fish flashes at the top of my screen. I'm supposed to tap all the red fish that pop up, but not the green fish or the blue. And I have to do this without crashing the car.

An unidentifiable, omnipresent game-meister says: ""Doing one thing at a time is easy, but doing them both at the same time is where the magic happens!""

As I get better at the game, my brain is being trained to ignore distractions and stay focused — or, at least, that's the hypothesis of the neuroscientists who designed it.

The brain networks that control multitasking overlap with networks that control working memory and attention span. So some scientists believe that by playing this game — Project Evo — you can improve a range of cognitive skills and, by extension, relieve a range of symptoms associated with cognitive disorders.

""We've been through eight or nine completed clinical trials, in all cognitive disorders: ADHD, autism, depression,"" says Matt Omernick, executive creative director at Akili, the Northern California startup that's developing the game.

Omernick worked at Lucas Arts for years, making Star Wars games, where players attack their enemies with light sabers. Now, he's working on Project Evo. It's a total switch in mission, from dreaming up best-sellers for the commercial market to designing games to treat mental health conditions.

""The qualities of a good video game, things that hook you, what makes the brain — snap — engage and go, could be a perfect vessel for actually delivering medicine,"" he says.

In fact, the creators believe their game will be so effective it might one day reduce or replace the drugs kids take for ADHD. But this kind of goal requires a totally different business model; before they can deliver their game to players, they first have to go through the Food and Drug Administration — the FDA.

""The first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting, everyone's like, 'Oooo, that's scary, do we want to do that?' "" Omernick recalls.

Silicon Valley companies routinely avoid government regulation if at all possible; the process for FDA approval can be slow and expensive.

""If it says 'FDA approval needed' in the business plan, I myself scream in fear and run away,"" says Tim Chang, managing director at Mayfield Fund, a venture capital firm. He has never backed a company that wanted to go through the FDA.

Most startups can bring a new video game to market in six months. Going through the FDA approval process for medical devices could take three or four years — and cost millions of dollars.

""That's what's been scary about going the regulatory path,"" Chang says. ""You're waiting and waiting and waiting for FDA approval, going through all these different clinical tests, and you could run out of money easily before you get through that.""

The worst fear is that the technology will become outdated by the time the FDA process is complete. Tech companies are constantly redesigning their software to keep up with competition and consumer habits. Chang says in four years a game could be obsolete.

""It's really out of sync with the way we think of product iteration,"" he says. ""We're more on the order of days and real-time changes, where you're pushing out app updates every week.""

On the other hand, Chang admits that going the regulatory route could really pay off. If the FDA gives its stamp of approval, doctors could prescribe the game. And that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it.

""Then you're going into the land of the big, big budgets,"" Chang says.

Within in the health care field, some executives believe the commercial successes of online games like Angry Birds and Candy Crush could translate into the medical world. They see the potential of these games to not only make money — but to save money, too.

""When you look at the percentage of individuals that are playing video games [59 percent] and overlay that with the percentage of individuals that have chronic conditions or need some assistance from the medical perspective [45 percent], the relationship is pretty strong,"" says Willis Gee, director of information technology strategy and innovation at health insurer Cigna.

On one level, it's about competition. The Affordable Care Act has made it a lot easier for people to switch health plans. Cigna has to find ways to stand out.

""People want to do things that are fun,"" says Gee. ""So, we have to be there with them.""

It might seem like a strange vision for an industry known best for issuing denial letters. But Gee believes reimbursing patients to play games could cut other health costs — by promoting exercise and preventing disease, for example, or even reducing the amount of expensive drugs people take.

""As an industry, we're going to have to reorient ourselves around what it is we're really trying to do,"" he says. ""And if, at the end of the day, the goal is about improving health, then we may need to revisit the way we are quantifying outcomes.""

Drug companies are keeping an eye on these games, too. Pfizer partnered with the Project Evo team to see if the game could help improve the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. The drug manufacturer believes it could alleviate some of the problems with drug trials — helping to make them faster, cheaper and more efficient.

Right now, screening for Alzheimer's is subjective. Patients and families fill out forms on mood and attention. The results are often inaccurate. Some of the people recruited for drug trials end up not having Alzheimer's at all. Dr. Michael Ehlers, Pfizer's chief scientific officer for neuroscience, says Project Evo could help them identify better candidates more quickly.

""I'd like to think we could cut down standard clinical trials, in size and length of time, by half or more,"" he says.

In terms of the game replacing drugs someday, though, Ehlers isn't so sure. He has a different analogy.

""It's just essentially a digital version of otherwise typical kinds of psychological and cognitive behavioral therapy,"" he says.

But, Ehlers still thinks game designers should go through the same FDA tests and trials as drug manufacturers.

""Quite important is that we hold them to the same standard of evidence that they actually work,"" he says.

Here, Ehlers touches on a broader controversy around games like Project Evo. There are several scientists who say this field is so new that it's lacking in good evidence that brain changes actually occur.

Randall Engle of the Georgia Institute of Technology believes giving the game FDA approval could hinder good science.

""Because it's a proprietary thing at that point — and that's a problem. If it becomes proprietary, the only people who can do unfettered research on it are the people who own the procedure,"" he says.

But, then again, that's exactly how it works with drugs.",1
"Correction: An earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the person who designed the MMSE test. This version has been corrected.

A small company started by a neuroscientist at the University of Rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple, computer-based tool to help detect early signs of Alzheimer’s disease or other forms of dementia.

Cerebral Assessment Systems has received marketing approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for Cognivue, a cognitive-assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game. A patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time-strapped primary-care physician tends to other patients. The 10-minute, non­invasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain’s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia.

The federal government’s approval to market the device comes as Alzheimer’s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages.

[Scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for Alzheimer’s disease]

“Look, there is a late-life tsunami of late-life cognitive decline coming at us, and health-care providers are standing on the beach,” said Charles J. Duffy, a neurology professor at the University of Rochester Medical Center who founded the company. “What we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care.”

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer’s disease, the leading cause of dementia. That number is expected to reach 13.5 million by 2050, according to the Alzheimer’s Association. With the United States shifting toward an older society, the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease, perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle. In addition to Alzheimer’s, a person’s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions, such as untreated diabetes, thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications.

Duffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people’s memory and ability to think.

With Cognivue, patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images, such as a group of dots, that move around and fluctuate in clarity. Using a rotary-shaped mouse called a manipulandum, the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge-shaped cursor. The task becomes more difficult, especially for people with early stages of dementia, as the dots move around, changing their direction, speed and intensity.

“All perception is interpretive, and so what we’re doing is measuring that process,” Duffy said. Other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes.

Cerebral Assessment Systems’ device received de novo approval from the FDA, a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk.

The Pittsford, N.Y.-based company’s FDA application included data from a comparative study involving 401 people recruited from 13 communities for older adults. The subjects, ranging in age from 55 to 95, were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities: normal, mild cognitive impairment and impaired. Their performance on the Cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the St. Louis University Mental Status Examination (SLUMS).

The device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function. It is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool, and its effectiveness for people with less than 12 years of education is not proven.

Linda M. Rice, a primary-care internist with about 1,200 patients in her Rochester practice, said that after a year of using the device in her clinic, she is convinced of its worth. About half of her patients are older than 65, and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities.

But her options for rating their performance involve administering the Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) , also known as the Folstein test, that uses a 30-point questionnaire. The test, which has been around since 1975, offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems, she said.

“You have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam,” she said.

But the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost $1,000 or more. The computer-based tool created by Duffy has helped Rice to convince some patients that it’s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of Alzheimer’s.

“I think it’s a really potentially valuable tool,” said Leslie Algase, an internist who tends about 2,000 patients in Rochester, at least 30 percent of whom are older than 65. Algase, who said she has no financial ties to the company, agreed to use the Cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting Duffy at a conference.

Algase rates the device as about as accurate as the MMSE. But she said it’s more convenient and less time-consuming to administer.",1
"Previous research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer’s has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University’s Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage.

As Alzheimer’s disease progresses, cognitive impairment can take an ever greater toll on communication and relationships. A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer’s maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners.

“No one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,” said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. “Some past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer’s] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that.”

Members of Williams’s research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded.

In analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they’d learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate — for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed.

The caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners’ efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners’ versions of past events. This showed that they “value the relationship more than being right,” Williams said.

Some of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer’s. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication.

“The reality is, a person with dementia isn’t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,” Williams said. “At the same time, people with Alzheimer’s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it’s unexpected. These are moments that caregivers can cherish.”

"Researchers from the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center and Rutgers University studied 408 males from adolescence to their mid-30s. The participants fell into four groups: those with no use or low use of marijuana, early chronic users, those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug. The early chronic users smoked a great deal -- a peak of more than 200 days per year on average when they were 22 years old.

The researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues -- including depression, psychotic symptoms or asthma -- in any group, even those with very high use. They controlled for cigarette smoking, other drug use, access to health insurance and other factors.

""What we found was a little surprising,"" lead author Jordan Bechtold, a research fellow at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, said in a statement.

Based on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations, the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions. But there were none.

AD

They also found no link to a wide range of other health issues: cancer, asthma, respiratory problems, depression, anxiety, allergies, headaches or high blood pressure.

Bechtold said the researchers wanted to ""help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana"" but that this is a very complicated issue and one, study, including his own, should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers' marijuana use.

One major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their 30s ""which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge,"" the authors acknowledge. ""Therefore, continued data collection and longer follow-ups are needed.""

Update: The study's findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis, according to the editors of the Psychology of Addictive Behaviors. In a lengthy clarification issued in December 2015, the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues. However, the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions -- that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non-users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test.

"LONDON (Reuters) - A “brain training” iPad game developed in Britain may improve the memory of patients with schizophrenia, helping them in their daily lives at home and at work, researchers said on Monday.

Scientists at Cambridge University said tests on a small number of patients who played the game over four weeks found they had improvements in memory and learning.

The game, “Wizard”, is designed to help so-called episodic memory — the type of memory needed to remember where you left your keys several hours ago, or to remember a few hours later where you parked your car in a multi-storey car park.

Schizophrenia is a long-term mental health condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms, ranging from changes in behavior through to hallucinations and delusions.

While some psychotic symptoms can be reasonably well treated with medication, patients often still have debilitating problems with memory and cognitive function, meaning they struggle to get back to work or stay in education.

There is increasing evidence that computer-assisted training can help people with schizophrenia overcome some of their symptoms, with better outcomes in their daily lives.

This study, published in the journal Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society B, found that 22 patients who played the memory game made significantly fewer errors and needed significantly fewer attempts to remember the location of different patterns specific tests.

They also improved their scores on the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) scale, which doctors use to rate the social, occupational and psychological functioning of adults.

Importantly, the patients also said they enjoyed the game and were motivated to play it across the eight hours of cognitive training. The researchers said this was important, since lack of motivation is a common feature of schizophrenia.

“We need a way of treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia, such as problems with episodic memory, but slow progress is being made toward developing a drug treatment,” said Barbara Sahakian from the department of psychiatry at Cambridge University.

“This proof-of-concept study...demonstrates that the memory game can help where drugs have so far failed. (And) because the game is interesting, even those patients with a general lack of motivation are spurred on to continue the training.”",0
"The study reported that ""taking aromatase inhibitors for 5 years reduced the risk of postmenopausal women with breast cancer dying of their disease by 40 percent within 10 years of starting treatment, compared with no hormonal treatment.""

The results were part of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, a collaboration based at the University of Oxford, that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years.

Paul Workman, professor and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said in a statement accompanying the publication of the journal article that ""the evidence on aromatase inhibitors has been accumulating for well over a decade, but it has taken this huge and complex study to make sense of all the data, and provide a firm basis for clinical guidelines.”

AD

""It tends to be the discovery of new treatments that grabs the headlines, but it is just as important to maximize the benefit patients get from existing treatments through major, practice-changing studies like this,"" Workman said.

AD

The researchers wrote in the study that a substantial number of the trial participants switched from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors after they heard that it could reduce recurrence, which affected their results. If this had not happened, ""the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater,"" they surmised.

A separate analysis by the same group, also published in The Lancet, looked at bisphosphonates, which are typically used for osteoporosis. Researchers at Sheffield University found that in postmenopausal women during the first 10 years after diagnosis of breast cancer, the drug could reduce the risk of death by 18 per cent.

AD

Using the two drugs together as a one-two punch may be even more powerful.

Richard Gray, a professor at the University of Oxford and who served as the lead statistician for both studies, said that half of all women with breast cancer are postmenopausal with hormone-sensitive tumors and could potentially benefit from both drugs.

AD

“The drugs are complementary, because the main side effect of aromatase inhibitors is an increase in bone loss and fractures, while bisphosphonates reduce bone loss and fractures as well as improving survival,"" he said.

"A scourge we can eliminate, if we choose wisely: the human papillomavirus. Photo by the Laboratory of Tumor Virus Biology

Through an article in Forbes I saw that a new study has been published about the safety of Gardasil, a vaccine for prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus, or HPV.

HPV is a virus that can lead to genital warts, many types of cancer, and cervical cancer in women, which kills 4,000 women every year in the U.S. alone.

The Gardasil vaccine, on the other hand, caused some people to faint after getting it, and others got mild skin infections—both of which occur somewhat rarely with other vaccines too, as you might expect.

Which sounds worse to you?

The study, published in the Pediatric Infectious Disease Journal, looked at the published data about effects from the vaccine and found that it has a “favorable safety profile.” This study comes after many other previous studies that show essentially the same thing. There is no correlation between getting the Gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as “autoimmune diseases (including Guillain-Barre Syndrome and multiple sclerosis), anaphylaxis, venous thromboembolism, and stroke.”

Mind you, all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it. And, just like essentially every claim made by the anti-vaccination movement, these arguments are wrong.

That doesn’t stop them from making them, or from them getting attention by mainstream media; attention they most assuredly do not deserve.

It’s very frustrating; mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low-risk, but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop. For example, a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine, and it got a lot of press, but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause. This, sadly, is expected; more than 178 million doses of Gardasil have been given worldwide, and given that huge number it’s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them. But as the saying goes, correlation is not causation. The vaccines are not to blame here.

Even more frustrating about this vaccine is that it’s being fought by an unusual group of people; while most anti-vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion, Gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous, because HPV is a sexually transmitted disease.

However, this has been shown to be false. Worse, these same people tend to promote abstinence-only education, which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education; kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more STIs than ones who are taught progressive, healthy sex ed.

It’s like Bizarro world, where everything is backward. All the evidence shows Gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses. It also shows that the claims made by anti-vaxxers are wrong, and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse.

And yet they dig in. They insist real science is wrong, that their anecdotes are better, that the entire medical industry is on the take (which is silly beyond reason).

But that’s where we are. When it comes to health issues, especially ones tied to sexuality, reason goes out the window and emotions take over.

That’s why I am very, very clear about this: I and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations, and my daughter has had all three stages of the Gardasil vaccine (we’d have done that if she had been a boy, too). As a parent, as someone who knows and loves someone with an autoimmune disorder, and as a person who knows just how truly awful so many diseases are and how easily and safely they can be prevented, I am a strong advocate for vaccinations.

It’s your body, but it affects literally everyone around you. Don’t listen to the anti-vaxxers, who just want to scare you. Get the facts. And please, talk to your board-certified doctor and find out if there are any vaccinations you need.

How many lives will you save when you do?

"WASHINGTON—People with mild Alzheimer’s disease who started taking an experimental Eli Lilly LLY -0.70% & Co. drug earlier in the course of their disease fared better than patients who started later in a clinical trial.

The outcome may bolster the company’s case that the drug, solanezumab, can slow the decline of memory and function in mild Alzheimer’s patients, despite prior studies with negative results. But the new data aren’t final proof of the drug’s benefit—a separate, continuing study due to end in late 2016 is designed to more definitively test its efficacy and safety.

In other studies, Biogen Inc. BIIB -0.13% announced some new data suggesting that its experimental Alzheimer’s drug slowed the progression of the disease, while researchers said a clinical trial of a Roche Holding AG compound indicated the therapy reduced the volume of a substance in the brains of patients that is believed to contribute to the disease.

Results of these studies were presented Wednesday at the Alzheimer’s Association International Conference in Washington. The data are largely incremental but were still being watched keenly by investors, who are looking for signals of potential success after years of failed drug candidates in the Alzheimer’s space.

The drug-industry trade group, the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association, recently released a report calculating that 123 experimental therapies for Alzheimer’s failed between 1998 and 2014 while only four drugs made it to market.

Lilly hopes solanezumab becomes the first marketed treatment to slow the worsening of the underlying disease. Current treatments for Alzheimer’s can alleviate symptoms but don’t slow underlying disease progression.

Jefferies & Co. analyst Jeffrey Holford estimates the Lilly drug could generate peak annual sales of more than $3 billion world-wide if it is approved for marketing by regulators. A leading theory in Alzheimer’s research is that the buildup of a sticky protein known as beta amyloid in the brain contributes to the disease. Lilly’s solanezumab is designed to bind to amyloid and clear it from the brain.

But the amyloid hypothesis hasn’t been proven in clinical trials. In two large clinical trials reported in 2012, solanezumab failed to significantly slow the decline of cognition and functional abilities among the overall population of patients with mild to moderate Alzheimer’s, compared with a placebo. Other companies’ drugs targeting amyloid also have failed in trials.

Lilly scientists, however, said the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline in a subgroup: patients with a mild form of the disease. The company has continued developing the drug in mild Alzheimer’s patients.

Since 2012, Lilly has continued to provide the drug to patients who received it in the earlier trials, and patients who originally received a placebo in those studies were allowed to switch over to solanezumab. On average, the placebo patients started solanezumab 18 months after the earlier patients.

The new results showed that the patients who started therapy earlier retained an advantage in cognition and daily function over those who started later, and that this difference persisted for two years.

Researchers said such a finding is consistent with the hypothesis that solanezumab is modifying the underlying disease. Some patients receiving solanezumab experienced swelling in the brain and other adverse events, but researchers said the drug was generally well tolerated.

“Here we have a safe antibody treatment, solanezumab, that appears to benefit mild Alzheimer’s disease dementia subjects,” said Paul Aisen, director of the Alzheimer’s Therapeutic Research Institute at the University of Southern California, who presented the results.

Eric Siemers, an Alzheimer’s researcher at Lilly, said the new clinical data increases his confidence in solanezumab but “we’ll find out if it works or not” when a separate, continuing study of the drug is completed by the end of 2016.

In March, Biogen, of Cambridge, Mass., announced some results from an early-stage clinical trial that showed its drug, aducanumab, given to a very small group of participants with mild memory problems appeared to reduce the amount of amyloid in the brain. The treatment also appeared to slow down cognitive decline—particularly at the highest dose of 10 mg/kg—in these people.

The results impressed Wall Street and lifted the company’s stock to all-time highs. RBC Capital Markets analyst Michael Yee estimates annual sales of the Biogen drug could top $10 billion if it reaches the market. The March findings, however, didn’t include all doses of medication at the 12-month time point.

Aducanumab is an antibody that is thought to bind to sticky clumps of the protein amyloid in the brain and causes cells to digest away the plaque and reduce amyloid, said Alfred Sandrock, Biogen’s chief medical officer.

On Wednesday, researchers presented Biogen’s full one-year data of all four medication doses at one year of treatment, as well as more participants in the placebo arm of the study. The results were largely consistent with the March analyses.

“I breathed a huge sigh of relief” after seeing the Biogen data, said Mark Schoenebaum, biotech and pharmaceuticals analyst at Evercore ISI.

With a Roche compound called gantenerumab, new results in a subset of participants of the biomarker and brain imaging data showed that the compound did appear to reduce amyloid plaque as hypothesized, nearly two years after the start of treatment.

A trial of the therapy was discontinued in December 2014 after a preplanned look at the data in the middle of the study suggested the treatment wasn’t making an impact on cognition.

That means the compound appears to work the way it is theorized to, yet still didn’t appear to influence cognitive decline, raising questions about whether removing amyloid plaque yields a benefit on cognition.

Philip Scheltens, Director of the Alzheimer Center at the VU University Medical Center in Amsterdam, who presented the data to media, said the findings suggested the doses tested were too low to be effective.

A researcher at Switzerland-based Roche announced Wednesday it is going to investigate a higher dose of the compound in an extension of the trial.

Researchers at Axovant Sciences of Bermuda, whose drug candidate RVT-101 works on neurotransmitters in the brain, presented a new analysis of data from its previously reported clinical trial. These data, which included only the participants to finish the trial, were consistent with previously announced data, which included everyone who started the trial whether they dropped out or not.

SUNDAY, July 19, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- It's still very early, but scientists say a test based on a patient's saliva might someday help detect Alzheimer's disease.

""Saliva is easily obtained, safe and affordable, and has promising potential for predicting and tracking cognitive decline, but we're in the very early stages of this work and much more research is needed,"" study author Shraddha Sapkota, a neuroscience graduate student at the University of Alberta in Canada, said in a news release from the Alzheimer's Association.

The study was to be presented Sunday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Washington, D.C. Experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

In the study, Sapkota's team tested the saliva of 22 people with Alzheimer's disease, 25 people with what's known as mild cognitive impairment (a decline in memory and thinking that's sometimes a precursor to dementia), as well as 35 people whose mental skills were normal for their age.

They found that the saliva of people with Alzheimer's had different levels of certain substances compared to the saliva of healthy people or those with mild cognitive impairment.

Experts agreed that the findings held promise, but much more research will be needed.

""This is a very preliminary study with a small number of subjects and the results are far from conclusive,"" said Dr. Allison Reiss, head of the Inflammation Section at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y.

She believes the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors -- things such as ""coexisting illnesses, medications, hydration state, tobacco use and multiple other variables"" that could influence what's found in the saliva samples.

""There are many gaps in the evidence,"" Reiss said. ""It is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites [in saliva] and Alzheimer's risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study.""

Still, Dr. Paul Wright, chair of neurology at North Shore University Hospital in Manhasset, N.Y., said the research ""is still in its infancy but very promising.""

If a saliva test lives up to its promise, one advantage is ""the ease of obtaining a sample,"" he said.

But that convenience also brings its own problems, Wright added. People might ask for a test even when they don't show any signs of dementia, and ""this may result in anxiety and depression if there is a false positive result,"" he said.

For that reason, ""larger studies are needed to corroborate and validate their findings,"" Wright said.

"The latest advances in Alzheimer’s disease involve people who don’t appear to show any signs of cognitive decline yet. Experts now believe that the biological processes behind the neurodegenerative condition begin years, if not decades, before memory problems and confusion become noticeable.

At the annual Alzheimer’s Association International Conference, researchers say they have found a series of substances in saliva that can distinguish between people who experience normal aging, those with mild cognitive dementia (MCI, which in some cases can lead to Alzheimer’s and in other cases not), and Alzheimer’s disease.

Presenting at the meeting, Shraddha Sapkota, a graduate student in neuroscience at University of Alberta, and her colleagues described how they carefully analyzed the saliva of a group of volunteers participating in an aging study. Some had been diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and some with MCI, while others did not have any neurological conditions. By comparing their saliva components, the scientists found that each of the three groups showed slightly different patterns of compounds, which could form the basis of a relatively easy and non-invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions.

The results aren’t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop Alzheimer’s, but that’s the goal, says Sapkota. Ideally, for example, isolating those with MCI might help doctors to focus in on a group of patients who might be at higher risk of developing Alzheimer’s and therefore might need more intensive and regular testing.

"While prenatal testing is widely used for pregnant women at risk of having babies with chromosome disorders such as Down syndrome, new research shows certain types of tests may also reveal markers of cancer in mothers.

When Marin Mejia was pregnant with her son Owen, one such blood test that picks up DNA from mother and baby came back showing abnormal results. Further testing showed the baby was healthy.

But doctors told Mejia they needed to investigate what caused the irregular finding.

At the time she was 39 and had experienced bleeding she blamed on hemorrhoids. More testing showed she had anal cancer.

Recent research from Tufts Medical Center found evidence that these prenatal tests can detect cancers in pregnant women. The study, funded by Illumina, a maker of one non-invasive prenatal test, looked at eight women with abnormal test results. The findings are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

""If there is cancer, the tumor is shedding DNA into the mother's blood as well and that is what is accounting for this imbalance,"" study author Dr. Diana Bianchi, who serves on an advisory panel for the company, told CBS News.

Mejia's cancer was advanced and it spread to her lymph nodes and lungs. Doctors delivered Owen at 32 weeks so she could begin chemotherapy and radiation.

""I am thankful for every minute I get to spend with them,"" she said. ""I refuse to believe that there's going to be any other outcome than 'it's all going to be okay' because the alternative is unfortunately not something I want to think about.""

Recent tests show the cancerous nodules in Mejia's lungs are shrinking, and she hopes for more good news after scans later this summer.",1
"A REFRESHING outdoor shower, an icy cocktail and a comfortable spot to watch the sunset: One could argue that the most relaxing parts of a sunny summer day don’t happen until it’s over. Keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work. The devotion to hats and rash guards, the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every 90 minutes is at best tedious, and when children are involved, the process can be truly demoralizing. But once the towels are hung on the line, in the soft light of dusk, your work is done. Right?

Not so fast.

Though women have been pummeled with information on sunscreen and other UV-protection products, few know what they can do to minimize sun damage after they go inside. Christine Lennon and Dr. Darrell Rigal join Tanya Rivero. Photo: Getty

A new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage. One proponent of the concept is Hillary Peterson, founder of Bay Area-based company True Nature Botanicals. Ms. Peterson, a former marketing executive, began to explore the use of all-natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma, the most serious type of skin cancer.

Her take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic. “The message with…protection has been to stay out of [the sun],” said Ms. Peterson. “But I’m on the phone with you from Hawaii and can see at least 40 people on the beach, soaking in the rays. My kids are outside playing. I know that it’s not realistic to say ‘no sun.’ ”

She is, however, quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you’re in the sun. (She’s also called on Terrence Collins, the Teresa Heinz Professor of Green Chemistry at Carnegie Mellon University as a consultant to formulate her line.) Ms. Peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from UV damage. (A groundbreaking study in 1996 proved antioxidants like vitamins C and E can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage.) She even brews antioxidant-rich green tea, lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle. “I spritz my kids with it before I apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun,” she said.

Now, a new study by Yale University cancer researchers, published this year, shows that the cell-damaging effects of ultra-violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover. Ergo, it may be necessary to draw out the day’s protective ministrations into nighttime.

This information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after-sun care—a category traditionally limited to aloe vera-laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun-parched skin but not much else. Product formulators are now seeing after-sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks.

Ms. Peterson recommends her Pacific Mist spray which contains antioxidant-rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract, which aids in hydration, and the line’s Pacific Face Oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed, kiwi, passion fruit and papaya seed—all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants.

When shopping for other after-sun treatments, be aware that some labels only add a trace, ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label, while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant.

“ My kids are outside playing. I know that it’s not realistic to say “no sun.” ”

One Love Organics, a 6-year-old company founded by ex-lawyer Suzanne LeRoux, is a fine example of the latter. Based in St. Simons Island, Ga., the brand has an Eco-Cert-certified lab that creates mostly organic, botanical-based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind. Ms. LeRoux typically recommends layering the brand’s Vitamin C Body Oil or the Gardenia + Tea Antioxidant Body Serum under sunscreen during the day. Rich with botanical oils and green tea extract, both are also ideal after-sun products. “Our lab is on an island in the South. We think about sun exposure a lot,” she added.

After-sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air, like Blissoma’s pomegranate extract-filled Amend Antioxidant Sprayable Lotion. Avoid products formulated with alcohol, which can dry skin out.

Not everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after-sun care. Beverly Hills-based dermatologist Rhonda Rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture. “That can make sun-exposed skin feel better,” she said, “But there’s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure.” And while Henry Lim, president of the American Academy of Dermatology, believes that the Yale study was important, he cautions that you only have a three-hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits—and that antioxidants “are notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective.”

But believers like True Nature Botanicals’ Ms. Peterson are undeterred. “In medicine, you need a definitive study,” she countered. “We can’t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet, your body will function better. But [by] bringing Omega-3 and -6 and antioxidants to the skin, we’re giving it more of the tools it needs to handle sun exposure.”",1

MONDAY, July 6, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A scan of calcium deposits inside your arteries can help doctors deduce how long you're likely to live, a new study has found.

The test, called a coronary calcium scan, uses a regular CT scan to look for calcium deposits in the three major arteries that carry blood away from the heart, said lead author Leslee Shaw, a professor of cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta.

People with the largest amounts of calcium in their arteries carry an early death risk that's six times greater than those with no calcium deposits, researchers found in a 15-year study of nearly 10,000 patients.

""If you had no calcium or very small amounts, we were able to track over a very long time that you actually had a very outstanding survival,"" Shaw said.

Calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls, Shaw said.

These plaques, which are caused by blood cholesterol, build up over time and cause arteries to narrow, leading to heart disease as the heart works harder to pump blood through the body.

If a plaque bursts, a blood clot can form on its surface, blocking blood flow and causing a heart attack, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke.

To prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said.

Doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said.

Up to now, however, there's been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person's long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less.

In this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military's Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors.

Researchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died.

Analysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person's major arteries.

Patients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium.

""This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,"" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital.

Calcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said.

""Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,"" he said. ""The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known.""

The results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said.

""It can be a very potent motivator,"" she said.

People with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said.

Shaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person's regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests. They generally cost less than $100, she said.

""I think it's headed that way,"" she said. ""We're kind of on the edge of this becoming more accepted.""

The findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

"A growing body of evidence suggests that weight-loss surgery is more effective than diet and exercise at getting rid of Type 2 diabetes.

A small but rigorous randomized trial published Wednesday in JAMA Surgery provides the latest evidence showing the superiority of bariatric surgery over lifestyle changes in resolving the chronic condition involving high blood sugar.

In the trial, 61 obese adults with diabetes were randomly assigned to one of two surgical procedures or intensive lifestyle intervention and followed for three years. Forty percent of those who had received a gastric bypass procedure and 29% who received a gastric band were considered in remission from diabetes and no longer needed to take medication after three years. In comparison, no one in the group who received intensive lifestyle intervention resolved their diabetes.

“I do think it adds strongly to the growing body of data that [surgery] should be considered” to treat people with obesity and diabetes, said Anita Courcoulas, head of minimally invasive bariatric and general surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine, who led the study.

However, to conclude firmly that surgery is the better option, data from more patients across several different treatment centers, followed for up to seven years after surgery, is needed, according to Dr. Courcoulas. Her group is conducting such a study, along with researchers from the University of Washington in Seattle, the Joslin Diabetes Center in Boston and the Cleveland Clinic.

The American Diabetes Association lists surgery as one option in its 2015 medical care guidelines for diabetic patients with a body-mass index over 35 but says there is insufficient evidence of benefit in those who are less overweight.

“In general, I agree that short-term outcomes for bariatric surgery...are more dramatic than that seen with lifestyle intervention,” wrote Jane Chiang, senior vice president for medical affairs and community information at the American Diabetes Association, in an email. However, “not everyone is a strong candidate for bariatric surgery.” Treatment should be tailored to each patient, she said.

The ADA’s Professional Practice Committee, which develops its medical guidelines, will carefully review the study and assess if any changes to clinical practice are warranted, according to Dr. Chiang.

In 2011, the International Diabetes Federation announced a position change stating that surgical options should be considered earlier on for eligible patients to help prevent complications from Type 2 diabetes.

The new study, which began in 2009, didn’t look at a bariatric surgery procedure that has become popular in recent years, known as the sleeve gastrectomy, said Dr. Courcoulas. However, a study by the Cleveland Clinic published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine did, and found a similar significant improvement in Type 2 diabetes after bariatric surgery procedures, including the sleeve gastrectomy, over lifestyle intervention.

Why bariatric surgery clears up diabetes isn’t fully understood and patients have different degrees of response to the procedures, said Dr. Courcoulas. Patients who undergo surgery usually lose significantly more weight than those receiving lifestyle intervention, but their diabetes often clears up before they lose a significant amount of weight, suggesting that weight loss alone isn’t the reason.

Some doctors say gastric bypass surgery appears especially beneficial, possibly because the procedure involves reducing the stomach to the size of a small pouch and bypassing a portion of the intestine, which potentially changes certain gastrointestinal hormones or other factors.

Michel Gagner, a clinical professor of surgery at Florida International University who wasn’t involved in the study but wrote an editorial accompanying the piece in the journal, said bariatric surgery should be used much more widely to treat diabetes, the way that heart surgery was widely used to treat coronary artery disease.

“I don’t know how many studies we need to do to keep comparing the best medical treatment to surgery, but it’s clear to me that surgery is the only thing that offers resolution to diabetes,” said Dr. Gagner.

(Reuters) - Bayer Healthcare said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved using transvaginal ultrasound as an alternate test to confirm if the company’s Essure permanent birth control device has been placed properly.

Essure is a small metal coil inserted into woman’s fallopian tubes. But since its approval in 2002, women using the device have sent the FDA more than 5,000 complaints, ranging from pain and menstrual problems to pregnancies and even deaths.

Some of the complaints related to the placement of the device.

In a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), sound waves emitted from a probe placed in vagina help a physician check if Essure has been placed properly.

This test is an alternative to the generally-prescribed modified hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test in which an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes is used to check for proper device placement.

A woman using Essure must do a test to confirm that the device is properly placed within three months of the procedure and until she receives a confirmation from her doctor, she must use alternate birth control methods, Bayer said in a statement on Wednesday.

All physicians who offer Essure are expected to be trained to perform the TVU confirmation test by mid-2016, the company said.

The training will start in September, the same month the FDA will hold a public panel meeting to discuss the safety and effectiveness of Essure.",1
"(Reuters Health) – Patients who need to be rehospitalized within a month after major surgery have a lower risk of death over the next two months if they return to the hospital where they had the surgery rather than going to a different facility, according to a new study.

“Most clinicians or surgeons feel like if you take the time to do a big operation on someone, you know the area operated on, how the operations went, if there were complications,” lead author Dr. Benjamin S. Brooke of the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City told Reuters Health by phone.

Doctors who did not perform the surgery won’t have that context, which may explain part of the survival benefit of returning to the original hospital, he said.

He and his team analyzed Medicare claims data from 2001 to 2011 on patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after major surgeries, including coronary artery bypass surgery, removal of the colon or pancreas, and hip or knee replacement. More than nine million patients underwent one of 12 such surgeries during the study period, and between six and 22 percent, depending on the surgery, were readmitted to the hospital within a month.

More than half the time, patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery.

Those who returned to the original hospital were 26 percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital, as reported in The Lancet.

“Patients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication, either medical or surgical,” Drs. Justin B. Dimick and David C. Miller, both of the University of Michigan, wrote in an editorial.

Patients readmitted at the original hospital also tended to be readmitted one to two days earlier than those who ended up at different hospitals.

It might be harder for patients to get appropriate care at the other hospitals, where they don’t have a pre-existing relationship with a surgeon, and so treatment might be delayed, Dimick and Miller wrote.

“If you are a surgeon or clinician who takes care of this person, it’s intuitive that going back to that surgeon would influence how well they do,” Brooke said.

For complex operations, some patients will fly to prestigious hospitals from several hundred miles away, he said. If these patients have complications weeks later, they end up going to a local hospital, not the one where they had surgery.

“A lot of big Fortune 500 companies contract with bigger hospitals for patients undergoing major surgery,” Brooke said, noting the Wal-Mart has contracted with the Cleveland Clinic.

“Even if they live in the same city where they had their surgery, they might have to call an ambulance to pick them up, and the ambulance drivers don’t understand how important it is to take them to the same hospital,” he said.

Ambulance drivers and emergency department doctors should make every effort to get a patient who has had major surgery back to their original hospital, he said.

“A lot of readmissions are patients who have time to be transferred or triaged, if they are not bleeding to death or having a heart attack,” he said.

Patients should try to stay in the immediate vicinity of their surgical hospital for at least a week, Brooke said.

"Doctors are experimenting with new technology that could give them a more complete view of the large intestine than ever before, improving the odds of finding potentially cancerous growths earlier.

Dr. Arie Kaufman of SUNY Stony Brook demonstrated the virtual colonoscopy for CBS New York's Dr. Max Gomez.

""We'll have both the computer and the doctors working in tandem to find polyps and find cancers,"" Kaufman said. He added it could lead to better and earlier detection of colon polyps.

Virtual colonoscopy screening uses CT scans to create color, 3D images of the colon, the final portion of the large intestine. Special computer animation enables a doctor to view the organ in remarkable detail. Regular colonoscopy physically examines the colon by inserting a lighted probe into the intestine and requires a sedative. Both have made early detection and treatment more precise.

This next step in virtual colonoscopy, called ""immersive colonoscopy,"" projects 3D images of the colon large enough to fill the walls of a room. Doctors can then ""walk through"" the colon and explore many different angles.

""We have the side view and the back view,"" said Kaufman. ""This will allow the physician to view 100 percent of the surface including lesions, which are hidden behind folds maybe seen on the side and back walls.""

Such highly specific screening may allow doctors to detect more abnormal growths, called polyps, when they are as small as .10 mm, so they can be removed before they become full-blown cancer tumors.

For the patient, a virtual colonoscopy is low risk but does involve additional exposure to radiation. It may need to be followed with the physical colonoscopy later, as well.

Colonoscopies are recommended for adults age 50 and over to help detect early signs of colorectal cancer. Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death among the combined group of men and women who have cancer, according to the National Institutes of Health.

The CDC says colonoscopy may also be recommended for people experiencing stomach pain, aches or cramps that don't go away, unexplained weight loss and blood in the stool. More routine DNA tests and stool sampling, which show signs of bleeding caused by irregular growths, can also help detect colon polyps and indicate that the need for a full colonoscopy.

The CDC says colonoscopy could reduce the number of colorectal cancer cases by as much as 60 percent. This new wave of radiology-based colonoscopy could improve those odds further.",1
"You no longer live in a world where you can pretend you’re only eating for one; the trillions of bacteria in your gut, we now know, also feed on what you put in your mouth—and they behave very differently depending on what that is.

It’s increasingly clear that the composition of your gut bacteria likely influences your risk for many health problems, from obesity and type-2 diabetes and even certain autoimmune diseases. Scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that’s that case, as well as which bacteria are beneficial—and how to protect them. A recent study published in The BMJ adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut-nourishing nutrient. (Unfortunately, less than 3% of Americans eat the government-recommended amount daily.)

“You really hold the reins to guiding this community [of bacteria] through the choices you make,” says Justin L. Sonnenburg, PhD, associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at Stanford University School of Medicine and author of The Good Gut. Sonnenburg was not involved with this study, but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria.

The authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species: Akkermansia muciniphila—a strain that’s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice. They wrangled a group of 49 overweight and obese adults, took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six-week calorie-restricted diet (between 1,500-1,800 calories per day) while increasing their fiber intake. The diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally. They kept a food journal throughout, and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue.

The people who had more Akkermansia in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet, compared to the people with less of the bacterium. Both groups of people lost the same amount of weight, but the high-Akkermansia group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others, says study author Patrice D. Cani, PhD, professor and group leader of the Metabolism and Nutrition Research Group at Université Catholique de Louvain in Belgium. “We discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of Akkermansia were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol, in glycemia, in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors.”

Higher levels of Akkermansia, the findings suggest, seem to have favorable effects on health.

The good news is that your initial Akkermansia levels are not your fate. People who started out with lower stores of Akkermansia had more after they followed the fiber-rich calorie-restricted diet. You can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber, Cani’s research suggests, which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria.

Now, Cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer Akkermansia alone, without any dietary modifications, to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors. “If we can improve these different parameters, that would be something great,” he says.

Here’s why fiber is so important to intestinal flora: your gut microbes feed on it and produce short-chain fatty acids, which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation, Sonnenburg says. “That means if you’re not eating dietary fiber, your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro-inflammatory state,” he says—the very state that predisposes us to different Western diseases. “Our diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why Western diseases are rising like crazy.”

Sonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis—eat food depleted of dietary fiber—their gut microbes behave erratically. “They turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine,” says Sonnenburg, “because that’s also a carbohydrate source and it’s kind of a fallback food for them.” In mice on a low-fiber diet, the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width, he says. It’s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans, but Sonnenburg thinks it might. “We start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic,” he says.

Loading up on fiber-fortified processed foods isn’t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut. Studies done on single fibers—those, like inulin, which are added to foods—haven’t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods. “All of the vegetables we’re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines, these are all filled with fiber, and filled with a diversity of fiber, and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota,” Sonnenburg says.

Nuts, seeds, whole grains, legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber—as are vegetables. “You can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you, you can feel really satisfied and full,” Sonnenburg says. “I find that a really nice way to eat—just kind of gorging myself on plant material.”

"Researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston have identified a large and readily detectable molecule that circulates in the blood and has identified, with perfect accuracy and no false positives, the presence of pancreatic cancer in a small group of subjects.

Searching blood samples of pancreatic cancer patients and controls for a distinctive molecule given off by the malignancy, scientists were even able to distinguish subjects with benign pancreatic disease from those with early-stage cancer.

The telltale sign of pancreas cancer was found in protein- and nucleic-acid-filled sacs called exosomes, which circulate in the bloodstream. Spinning blood samples in a centrifuge, researchers found they could break open those sacs and readily detect a protein called glypican-1, which is overexpressed in breast and pancreatic cancers.

The finding “offers the possibility for early detection of pancreatic cancer and help in designing potential curative surgical options,” the authors of the new research wrote. For a cancer that has already metastasized in four of five patients newly diagnosed, earlier detection holds a strong promise of improving pancreatic cancer’s dismal survival rate, they added.

Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest of all common cancers in the United States. An estimated 44,000 are diagnosed with the malignancy each year in the country, usually when it has reached a very advanced stage and few treatment options are effective. Just 5% of those diagnosed with this form of malignancy survive five or more years.

Clotilde Thery, a cancer researcher at France’s Institut Curie, greeted the possibility with enthusiasm.

“The potential implications of such a test are huge,” Thery wrote in an editorial published alongside the study, in the journal Nature. Although she said its findings need to be replicated in much larger groups, she hailed the finding as “clinically important.”

UC San Francisco cancer physician Alan Venook cautioned, however, that much more needs to be known about the telltale sign of cancer explored in the new research before its lifesaving properties can be established.

“The issue is, can you detect these in patients that don’t have advanced cancer?” Venook said. “The answer is, we don’t know.” The numbers tested by the MD Anderson researchers -- 251 patients with pancreatic cancer (five of whom had very early lesions), 32 with chronic pancreatitis and 120 healthy controls -- aren’t nearly large enough to draw such conclusions. And getting a clear answer, Venook said, would probably require lengthy and expensive studies on very large populations.

FOR THE RECORD

June 25, 4:06 p.m.: An earlier version of this article underreported the number of people tested for the glypican-1 protein by the MD Anderson researchers. Participants with pancreatic cancer numbered 251, not 56; healthy controls numbered 120, not 20; those with chronic pancreatitis numbered 32, not six.

"Annual incidence rate of developing a primary malignant brain tumor is 7/100,000n population, and the lifetime risk is 0.6 percent. In addition, metastases from systemic cancer to the brain are 10 times more common than primary malignancy of the brain. Brain tumors can develop in both males and females and at any age (though they're more common in adults). The most common type of primary malignant brain tumors is malignant glioma.

Brain tumors are diagnosed with clinical symptoms as well as advance imaging modalities of the brain, such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging.

Conventional surgery is usually the first step to have tissue diagnosis and decrease the burden of tumor. However, it's not a cure for malignant brain tumors and is usually followed by other types of adjuvant treatments, such as radiation and/or chemotherapy. Not all brain tumors are amenable to conventional surgery, for multiple reasons – such as location in deep parts of the brain with limited surgical access or being adjacent to critical structures. In addition, in some conditions increased risk of morbidity is seen after surgery, like in recurrent tumors with prior radiation or surgery. These patients, especially in the recurrent setting, have limited treatment options.

Focused high-dose radiation like stereotactic radiosurgery is useful in brain metastasis and could be used as initial treatment. However, radiosurgery is not useful for malignant primary brain tumors like gliomas, and even in metastasis it does have variable degree of failure based upon the size of tumor and prescribed radiation dose.

Patients who are suffering from deep seated or recurrent primary brain tumors, as well as those with brain metastases who failed radiation, have limited options and may benefit from alternative treatments like laser ablation.

Laser ablation is a minimally invasive treatment modality for brain tumors that uses laser technology to increase the temperature of tumor and subsequently kill tumor cells. It also might have a role in enhancement of chemotherapy and radiation therapy effects by disruption of repair mechanisms in tumor cells and increase the permeability of blood vessels of brain. Unlike conventional surgery, it doesn’t need extensive surgical exposure. Actually, it works through a small stab incision in the skin and a small hole in the skull.

Laser probe will be inserted using intra-operative navigation, and controlled firing of the laser will cause an increase in the temperature of tumor and eventually destruction of tumor cells. Although this technology has been around for decades, new technical advancements like specific MR-thermometric scans during surgery have an almost real-time measurement of brain temperature and control of the extension of treatment field, which allows the robotic probe driver to change direction and the depth of laser probe during surgery to have complete coverage of the tumor. Plus, a completely newly designed laser probe with a built-in cooling system prevents excessive temperature of the probe during surgery, which has made a resurgence of this treatment modality for intracranial applications in recent years.

Since five years ago, when the NeuroBlate System was approved by the Food and Drug Administration, hundreds of patients with brain tumors who used to be considered inoperable underwent this procedure successfully with promising outcomes. It's especially crucial for patients with brain tumors in difficult-to-access locations, as well as for those who have experienced failure of prior radiation treatment.

Being a relatively new procedure, NeuroBlate doesn't yet qualify as a standard treatment for brain tumors. However, initial results have been promising, and further studies are on the way.",1

Co-author Valter D. Longo, who studies longevity, described the idea behind fasting as a way to ""reboot"" a person's body by clearing out damaged cells and regenerating new ones.

""It's about reprogramming the body so it enters a slower aging mode, but also rejuvenating it ..."" he said. ""It's not a typical diet because it isn't something you need to stay on.""

The diet described in the study -- which the researchers dubbed the ""Fasting Mimicking Diet"" -- isn't quite as extreme as actual fasting. It works like this:

For 25 days out of the month, dieters can eat as they normally would -- the good, bad and in-between. Then for day one of the diet, they would eat 1,090 calories: 10 percent protein, 56 percent fat and 34 percent carbohydrates. For days two through five, 725 calories: 9 percent protein, 44 percent fat, 47 percent carbohydrates.

AD

AD

In the study, participants consumed a lot of vegetable soup, kale crackers and chamomile tea. The calories consumed are 54 to 34 percent of what a typical person might eat in a day.

The participants in the study did this for three cycles or three months before the researchers measured them and found decreased risk factors and biomarkers for disease with no major adverse side effects.

Petronella Ravenshear, a nutritional therapist in London, told the Telegraph that the new diet ""is less of a stressor on the body than complete fasting.""

""It supplies most of the carbohydrates in the form of vegetables which are packed with phytonutrients and minerals and positively good for us, rather than grain-derived carbohydrates which don’t supply much except sugar,"" she said.

(Reuters Health) - Women who take part in exercise, diet programs or a combination of the two during pregnancy can prevent excessive weight gain, according to a fresh review of past research.

The review incorporates dozens of new studies to update a previous review that did not find enough evidence to support the use of diet and exercise during pregnancy.

After including the new studies, the new review found “high-quality evidence” to show diet, exercise or both can reduce the risk of excessive weight gain during pregnancy, write the researchers in The Cochrane Library.

Other benefits may include a lower risk of cesarean delivery, excessive birth weight, and respiratory

problems in the newborn, “particularly for high-risk women receiving combined diet and exercise interventions,” add the researchers, led by Benja Muktabhant of Khon Kaen University in Thailand.

The U.S. Institute of Medicine says the amount of weight women should gain during pregnancy varies depending on their non-pregnancy weight.

For example, a normal-weight woman should gain between 25 and 35 pounds, while an overweight woman should gain between 15 and 25 pounds. Obese women should gain even less.

Gaining too much weight is tied to an increased risk of complications for both mother and child, according to the researchers, who completed the review for The Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research.

For the new review, the researchers examined data from 65 randomized controlled trials, which are considered the “gold standard” of medical research. They were able to combine data from 49 trials involving a total of 11,444 pregnant women.

The women were randomly assigned to a diet, exercise, a combination of the two or standard care. The diets and exercise programs varied, but could include low-glycemic diets and unsupervised exercise.

Women who took part in diet, exercise or combination programs were about 20 percent less likely than women in standard-care groups to gain too much weight while pregnant, the researchers report.

The women who took part in diet, exercise and combination programs were also less likely to develop high blood pressure during pregnancy, compared to those in the standard care group.

There was no clear benefit among the women in the diet and exercise groups when the researchers looked at other complications, such as cesarean delivery, but it did look like there may be some benefit, they write.

While the new study generally did not show fewer complications in the diet and exercise group, Dr. Loralei Thornburg told Reuters Health that it’s good that there was no increase in complications.

“This was very reassuring that there wasn’t an increased risk of preterm birth with moderate exercise,” said Thornburg, a high-risk pregnancy expert at the University of Rochester Medical Center in New York.

“Most people gain more weight than they probably should during pregnancy,” Thornburg, who was not involved with the review, told Reuters Health.

She said women who gain too much weight may not be able to lose it after the baby is born. Then, during the next pregnancy the woman is already heavier and that may increase the risk of complications.

“In the next pregnancy, if you don’t get it off, you may go from obese to very obese,” Thornburg said.

She cautioned, however, that women should check with their doctors before starting a diet and exercise program during pregnancy.

"(Reuters) - Details of a large heart safety study presented on Monday appear to give Merck and Co’s diabetes drug Januvia a clean bill of health, possibly setting the stage for a return to sales growth for the drugmaker’s biggest product.

A view of the Merck & Co. campus in Linden, New Jersey March 9, 2009. REUTERS/Jeff Zelevansky

Merck in April said the study, called Tecos, of 14,724 patients with type 2 diabetes and a history of heart disease demonstrated that adding Januvia to usual care did not increase major heart problems any more than adding a placebo, removing a cloud that has been holding back sales of the medicine and the company’s share price.

Januvia, an oral medication known chemically as sitagliptin that helps lower blood sugar levels, had sales of about $4 billion in 2014, plus another $1.8 billion for the related combination product Janumet

On the study’s main focus, after about three years 11.4 percent of Januvia patients had experienced cardiovascular death, non-fatal heart attack, non-fatal stroke or hospitalization for unstable angina versus 11.6 percent in the placebo group.

The detailed results also showed no increase in hospitalization for heart failure, which had been a particular concern with DPP-4 inhibitors, the class to which Januvia belongs. There were 228 such hospitalizations for Januvia and 229 in the placebo group, according to data also published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

“We can be reassured we can use this drug for glucose lowering without affecting the already high cardiovascular risk in people with type 2 diabetes,” said Professor Rury Holman, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the data at the American Diabetes Association meeting in Boston.

“For the heart failure concern raised by other agents in the class there is no difference (with placebo),” he added.

There was also no significant difference between Januvia and placebo in infections, cancer, kidney failure or severe hypoglycemia, which is dangerously low blood sugar, researchers reported.

Acute pancreatitis, a concern with some diabetes drugs, was uncommon but higher with Januvia, 23 versus 12. That was not statistically significant.

“Numerically this is hardly a major risk, just something we need to keep an eye on,” Holman said.

Pancreatic cancers, also uncommon, were numerically fewer with Januvia, 9 versus 14.

Death from any cause occurred in 7.5 percent of Januvia patients versus 7.3 percent for placebo.

The Tecos heart safety study was conducted by an independent academic research collaboration between the University of Oxford Diabetes Trials Unit and the Duke University Clinical Research Institute. It was undertaken after heart safety concerns were raised over other diabetes medicines.",1
"BOSTON -- In 2006, the FDA warned the public that the use of common antidepressants, like Prozac and Paxil, late in pregnancy could put a baby at risk for respiratory failure. Many women with depression faced a difficult decision: continue their medication during pregnancy, potentially putting their child at risk, or jeopardize their own mental health by going off the drugs.

The FDA advisory pointed to a single study showing a six-fold increased risk of a condition called persistent pulmonary hypertension in newborns whose mothers were taking antidepressants.

But now a new, large-scale study finds that the risk is negligible -- much lower than previously believed, reports CBS Boston's Dr. Mallika Marshall.

Researchers at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston looked at 3.8 million pregnant women nationwide and found that those taking popular antidepressants, called SSRIs, did not appear to be at significantly increased risk of having a baby with pulmonary hypertension.

""The risk increase of taking antidepressants late in pregnancy, if present, is much more modest than previous studies have found,"" says Krista Huybrechts, Ph.D., an epidemiologist at Brigham and Women's Hospital. ""So for women with severe debilitating depression that is not responsive to other non-pharmacological treatments, this should be reassuring information.""

It's certainly reassuring news for Dr. Katherine Economy, a maternal fetal medicine specialist at the Brigham who cares for many pregnant women on antidepressants.

""They take them because they have a disease that impacts their daily life,"" Economy says. ""And for many women, they cannot get through their daily activities, getting out of bed, taking a shower, and preparing food for themselves. So for many of these women, these medications are life-saving and life-altering.""

Dr. Economy warns patients about the potential risks like withdrawal in the newborn and a small risk of heart defects, but says for many women, the worst time to stop their medications is at the end of pregnancy when postpartum depression becomes a concern.

""My basic message is that, overall, there may be some slight risks associated with the medication, but in balancing risks and benefits for most women, I would suggest they stay on their medication,"" she said.",1

"In a study of 436 patients with inoperable melanoma, Talimogene Laherparepvec had 16.3 percent of patients showing results at the six-month mark, compared to 2.1 percent taking the control therapy. Some patients were continuing to respond to T-VEC three years later.

Patients with stage III and early stage IV melanoma treated with T-VEC (163 people in all) lived an average of 41 months. This compared with an average survival of 21.5 months in the 66 earlier-stage patients who received the control immunotherapy. Immunotherapy, where agents are used to boost a body's natural defense against a tumor, are already the best treatments against melanoma. But this is the first time a modified virus has been successful in carrying out that treatment.

Using a virus as a drug isn't a new idea. Phage therapy, where viruses that attack certain bacteria are used in place of antibiotics, is commonly used in Europe and on the rise in the United States. But cancer therapies like the one described in the new paper take things a step further, manipulating existing viruses to turn them into cancer-fighting tools.

AD

AD

Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research and head of the trial, has been working on this particular virus for about a decade. Before he signed onto the project, it was primarily being investigated as a breast cancer treatment. But Harrington brought head, neck, and skin cancer patients into the mix, and melanoma seemed to have the best responses of all.

Here's how T-VEC works: It starts with the herpes virus, which is magnificent at proliferating itself within cells and then causing them to burst (that's where the cold sores come from). But T-VEC has had two key genes removed. These keep it from replicating within healthy cells, which can quickly spot it because of the missing genes.

But cancer cells aren't as savvy, and T-VEC has its run of them. Meanwhile, T-VEC has also been modified to produce a molecule called GM-CSF, which serves as a red flag waved at the immune system.

AD

AD

So in addition to the destructive power of the T-VEC cells themselves, the therapy summons the immune system right to where it's needed -- the tumor.

""This is a first in class agent, a brand new therapy,"" Harrington said. ""But it's just the farthest along of what we hope will be many more.""

Harrington expects the FDA to clear T-VEC within the year, and it could potentially be available to patients right away.

But there's more work to be done to determine just how T-VEC can fit into the cancer-treatment landscape. When the latest trial was started, Harrington explained, there was no standard of treatment for melanoma -- so it's compared to a treatment that no one expected to outpace T-VEC. Now that other therapies -- ones that target specific mutations in patients' cancer cells -- are showing more success than what was available when the trial was formed, researchers will have to see how T-VEC compares.

AD

AD

""The next steps are exciting, and already underway,"" he said. ""The next big frontier will be to combine this with existing immunotherapies. There's a strong rationale that other drugs on the market could act synogistically with ours.""

Trials are also underway to determine how T-VEC might do with other cancers. In the meantime, other researchers will continue to crack the codes of other viruses to make them do our bidding.

MONDAY, May 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Too few women at high risk for osteoporosis are being tested for the bone-depleting condition, while too many women at low-risk are being screened, a new study suggests.

A team led by Dr. Anna Lee Amarnath of the University of California, Davis, examined the medical records of nearly 51,000 women, aged 40 to 85, living in the Sacramento area.

The researchers looked at whether or not women were getting a dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) test, which measures bone mineral density.

The result: Osteoporosis screening rates jumped sharply at age 50, despite guidelines suggesting that screening only begin at age 65, unless a woman has certain risk factors.

However, the study also found that those risk factors -- a small body frame, a history of fractures, or taking medications that could thin bones -- had only a slight effect on a woman's decision to get her bones tested.

Over seven years, more than 42 percent of eligible women aged 65 to 74 were not screened, Amarath's team found, nor were nearly 57 percent of those older than 75.

However, nearly 46 percent of low-risk women aged 50 to 59 were screened, as were 59 percent of low-risk women aged 60 to 64.

The study was published online May 19 in the Journal of General Internal Medicine.

""DXA screening was underused in women at increased fracture risk, including women aged 65 years and older. Meanwhile, it was common among women at low fracture risk, such as younger women without osteoporosis risk factors,"" Amarnath said in a journal news release.

What to do? Reminder notes to doctors and patients might help, one expert said.

""Health systems should invest in developing electronic health records systems that prompt providers at the point-of-care when screening is needed and when it can be postponed,"" study senior author Joshua Fenton, an associate professor of family and community medicine at UC Davis, said in the news release.

"The largest analysis to date of amyloid plaques in people’s brains confirms that the presence of the substance can help predict who will develop Alzheimer’s and determine who has the disease.

Two linked studies, published Tuesday in JAMA, also support the central early role in Alzheimer’s of beta amyloid, the protein that creates plaques. Data from nearly 9,500 people on five continents shows that amyloid can appear 20 to 30 years before symptoms of dementia, that the vast majority of Alzheimer’s patients have amyloid and that the ApoE4 gene, known to increase Alzheimer’s risk, greatly accelerates amyloid accumulation.

The findings also confirm that amyloid screening, by PET scan or cerebral spinal fluid test, can help identify people for clinical trials of drugs to prevent Alzheimer’s. Such screening is increasingly used in research. Experts say previous trials of anti-amyloid drugs on people with dementia failed because their brains were already too damaged or because some patients, not screened for amyloid, may not have had Alzheimer’s.

“The papers indicate that amyloid imaging is important to be sure that the drugs are being tested on people who have amyloid,” said Dr. Roger Rosenberg, the director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Center at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, who wrote an editorial about the studies.",1
"An estimated 25 million to 45 million Americans suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, a gastrointestinal condition that can cause miserable symptoms. Making it worse for many patients, there hasn't been a conclusive test to diagnose what's wrong with them. Without proof of a physical cause, some doctors considered IBS a psychological disorder.

But that could finally change with the introduction of two simple new blood tests for spotting the disease. Dr. Mark Pimentel of Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles developed the tests.

""We now have a test to say, you have a disease,"" Pimentel told CBS News. ""Having a test like this shortens the time of suffering, it shortens the time of investigation and accelerates getting the patient directly to treatment.""

New tests for common gastrointestinal disorder

The tests, which measure antibodies in the blood, were based on research suggesting that IBS may develop after infection from a bacterial toxin found in food poisoning. Researchers believe the toxin triggers the immune system to attack a person's intestinal tract long after the toxin is gone.

Irina Obenauer was diagnosed with IBS years ago after suffering from diarrhea and bloating, but it took doctors a long time to rule out other possible diagnoses first.

""There's always kind of a 'trend of the week' that you had to go and get tested for and rule out, and at the end of the day you don't feel better,"" she said.

She got the new blood test to confirm her diagnosis, and when it came back positive, she said she felt a sense of relief knowing IBS wasn't all in her head.

""I'm not saying the symptoms went away,"" she said, but she ""started to feel more whole.""

CBS News chief medical correspondent Dr. Jon LaPook, who is also a practicing internist and gastroenterologist, points out that the test is not perfect. While a positive test result is highly suggestive of IBS, only 44 percent of patients with IBS tested positive, meaning that many people who test negative could in fact still have the condition.",0
"The first procedure carries a 15 percent risk of collapsing a lung (pneumothorax), as well as infection. The second is serious surgery that requires general anesthesia and results in the loss of lung tissue. Both are in-patient procedures that carry the cost and other risks of hospitalizations. In about a third of the surgeries, the growth turns out to be benign, meaning the surgery was unnecessary.

But now, according to a study published Sunday in the New England Journal of Medicine, there appears to be a new, much less invasive way of determining whether a growth is malignant. Researchers at Boston University have discovered that the thin epithelial cells that line the entire airway show changes that indicate whether a growth is malignant. With small brushes on the bronchoscope, they can take some of those cells and, using genomic testing that has been available only in recent years, reach a conclusion.

AD

The study released Sunday showed that the tests were about 97 percent accurate on 639 subjects. A private company has purchased the technology and is making it available to hospitals across the country.

""Even though lung cancer tends to develop deep in your lung, all the cells that line your airway are exposed,"" said Avrum Spira, a professor of medicine at Boston University who led the research. ""They have changes in their genome.""

Spira's test focuses on messenger RNA, the molecules that express genes' instructions to cells. He called the technology ""a canary in the coal mine"" for lung cancer, which kills about 160,000 people in the United States each year.

AD

If the test is negative, its accuracy will allow doctors to wait and watch a lesion. If it shows a malignancy, a biopsy still would be needed to confirm the cancer. ""There will still be a small number of biopsies,"" Spira said. ""But we're going to reduce them significantly.""

AD

Other research is being conducted to find markers for lung cancer, though much of it focuses on substances that can be found in the blood, Spira said. With the vast majority of lung cancer victims being smokers, the epithelial cells show changes that could be tracked once the technology became available, he said.

The next logical question is whether those changes might be detected early enough to predict and prevent lung cancer. Spira said his team already is working on research to determine whether that's possible.

AD

The current advance was a long time in coming and shows the difficulty of bringing research from the lab to the consumer. Spira said the initial discovery was made 12 years ago, but he couldn't find any private group willing to put up the millions of dollars needed to conduct studies, work through the government and academic regulatory process and bring his idea to market.

AD

Seven years ago, he formed his own company, raised venture capital and eventually proved that his idea worked. Now his company has been purchased by Veracyte, which will take over the production and marketing of the ""Bronchial Genomic Classifier.""

""We were adding 30 seconds to a minute"" to the length of a bronchoscopy, Spira said. "". . . Even then, the regulatory hurdles were significant. We got over them all, but they were significant.""

"A new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer. It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month.

Researchers found that a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who've had it before. (Another popular form of Vitamin B3 called niacin was not used in this study.)

For the study, researchers in Australia looked at nearly 400 people who had had at least two non-melanoma skin cancers. They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent.

""That's a dramatic number,"" Dr. David Agus, director of USC's Norris Westside Cancer Center, told ""CBS This Morning."" ""It could make a major impact.""

Vitamin B3 could help skin cancer patients

Dr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. ""If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,"" she told CBS News.

How does it work? Sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- ""turns back on the immune system,"" in Agus's words -- helping them repair the damage.

Nearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime.

The two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900.

One patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. She said she's had ""quite a few on the top of my head, a few on the back of my head, one behind each ear,"" even though she tries to stay out of the sun. Wiese had leukemia as a teenager and underwent radiation therapy, which put her at high risk for skin cancer later in life.

Wiese thinks the vitamin study sounds promising. ""I am absolutely willing to try it and hope for the best,"" she said.

Doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. ""It's safe, it's almost obscenely inexpensive, and it's already widely commercially available,"" Dr. Diona Damian, the senior author of the study and a professor of dermatology at the University of Sydney, told HealthDay.

But she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it. ""It's not something we'd recommend at this stage for the general population,"" Damian said. She also noted that the benefits appear to wear off when patients stop taking the supplements.

Results of the study are being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this month.",1
"For Headaches, A Lifestyle Change May Be Better Than A Doctor Visit

Enlarge this image Keith Negley for NPR Keith Negley for NPR

Terri Bradford has suffered debilitating headaches all her life. Some days the pain is so bad, she says, ""By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice.""

""I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.""

Over the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. ""Everything I've had, I've had twice,"" she says. ""I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count.""

Bradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines.

People who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston.

Mafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago.

Mafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested.

""There's a subconscious perception that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.""

""Patients are more assertive than ever before,"" Mafi says. ""They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' ""

And while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. ""I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care.""

Mafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies.

On top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers.

For Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. ""I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,"" she says.

Eventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. ""The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,"" Bernstein says. They say, "" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill.""

There is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. ""If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,"" Bernstein says.

But the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches.

At the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future.

Some people find relief through exercise. ""I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,"" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching.

A big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe. ""I'm finally healing,"" she says.",1
"Aaron E. Carroll answered readers’ questions about this article in a follow-up here.

When I was a kid, my parents refused to let me drink coffee because they believed it would “stunt my growth.” It turns out, of course, that this is a myth. Studies have failed, again and again, to show that coffee or caffeine consumption are related to reduced bone mass or how tall people are.

Coffee has long had a reputation as being unhealthy. But in almost every single respect that reputation is backward. The potential health benefits are surprisingly large.

When I set out to look at the research on coffee and health, I thought I’d see it being associated with some good outcomes and some bad ones, mirroring the contradictory reports you can often find in the news media. This didn’t turn out to be the case.

Just last year, a systematic review and meta-analysis of studies looking at long-term consumption of coffee and the risk of cardiovascular disease was published. The researchers found 36 studies involving more than 1,270,000 participants. The combined data showed that those who consumed a moderate amount of coffee, about three to five cups a day, were at the lowest risk for problems. Those who consumed five or more cups a day had no higher risk than those who consumed none.",1

The type of sugar you eat may affect your cravings for high-calorie foods, researchers report.

An experiment with 24 healthy volunteers found that compared with consuming glucose, consuming fructose — the sugar found in fruits, honey and corn syrup — resulted in more activity in the brain’s reward regions, increased responses to images of food and a tendency to choose eating a high-calorie food over a future monetary reward.

The volunteers drank a 10-ounce glass of cherry-flavored liquid that contained two and a half ounces of fructose or glucose. (Table sugar, or sucrose, extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets, is a compound of glucose and fructose.) Researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose, fructose and insulin, and of leptin and ghrelin, enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness.

Before having their drinks, the participants rated their desire to eat on a one-to-10 scale from “not at all” to “very much.” Then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets. As they did so, they rated their hunger using the scale. The volunteers were then presented with images of high-calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now, or a monetary award a month later instead.

The study, published in the journal PNAS, found that compared with glucose, consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain, a region that plays an important role in reward processing. The fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food, a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose.

When choosing between tasty high-calorie food or a delayed monetary reward, fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food.

There was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers. But plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers, which may affect what we eat, according to the senior author, Dr. Kathleen A. Page, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the Keck School of Medicine of the University of Southern California.

“Insulin is released when we consume glucose,” she said. “The pancreas secretes insulin, and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy. But it also sends a signal to the brain that says ‘you’ve eaten.’ Fructose doesn’t stimulate insulin secretion, and if there’s no insulin, you don’t get the information that you’re full.”

Does this mean that it is a good idea to avoid fruit, because it contains fructose?

“No,” Dr. Page said. “Don’t stop eating fruit. It has a relatively low amount of sugar compared with processed foods and soft drinks — maybe 5 grams in an orange, compared with 25 grams in a 12-ounce can of soda. And it is packed with fiber, which helps slow down the absorption of food, which makes you feel full.”

"The U.K.’s New At-Home HIV Test Is Better Than Anything We Have In The U.S.

In the U.K., checking your HIV status is now nearly as easy as taking a pregnancy test. BioSure UK has begun selling a $45 take-home HIV test that lets customers prick their fingers, smear the blood on a testing stick, and get their HIV results within 15 minutes.

BioSure’s test goes beyond any of the at-home tests available on the U.S. market, which are either not as fast or not as accurate. When asked if any test similar to BioSure’s new take-home test was in development, Tara Goodin, a press officer for the Food and Drug Administration, said: “The FDA cannot confirm the existence of or comment on any current/pending product applications.”

The FDA has approved two take-home HIV tests, but neither has all the strengths of the BioSure test. The Home Access HIV-1 Test System lets patients collect blood at home, but it must then be sent to a clinic for testing. (Users get their results by calling the company.) OraQuick, on the other hand, is an oral-based at-home test that does let users see their results immediately, but it has an 8.3 percent chance of a false negative. (In contrast, BioSure’s blood test has a much lower 0.2 percent chance that a person who is really HIV positive will test negative.)

Both countries have tried to make it easier to be tested. The United Kingdom’s National Health Service offers free HIV testing. In the United States, the Affordable Care Act designates HIV testing as a preventive service, meaning that all insurers must cover it without charging a co-pay.

But if the goal is to let patients test as accurately as possible at home, the United States is falling behind.

The two countries have roughly comparable rates of undetected HIV infections, although they use different methods to make those estimates. In the U.K., Public Health England, a division of the Department of Health, began testing anonymized blood samples that had been collected for other reasons. It adjusted the raw data to mirror the demographics of the U.K. as a whole and estimated that in 2012, 22 percent of all residents with HIV were undiagnosed.

The United States, meanwhile, uses new later-stage HIV cases to estimate who must have been infected but undiagnosed four years earlier. In a 2012 study, researchers estimated that in 2008, approximately 20 percent of all HIV-positive people in the United State were undiagnosed.

That suggests that both countries still face serious gaps in diagnosis. The British test will probably make it easier for people to be screened for the first time and will allow people to re-screen themselves more frequently. (There is a lag of about three months between initial HIV infection and the point at which it is detectable.)

A sizable fraction of the undiagnosed may be people who have been tested, just not recently enough. In a 2008 study of British men who frequented commercial gay venues, 42 percent of the men who tested positive for HIV had never been diagnosed with HIV. This wasn’t because they had never been screened; 81 percent of the undiagnosed men had been tested for HIV previously. Sixty-two percent of these previously screened men erroneously believed themselves to be HIV-negative.

Adopting some version of the British at-home test could help Americans who have already been tested keep up their screening schedule. There’s a benefit in regular screening, even for patients who don’t wind up connecting with a doctor.

In a small British study of 98 gay and bisexual men who were newly diagnosed as HIV-positive, the use of condoms after the diagnosis doubled relative to the rates of use pre-diagnosis (31 percent to 61 percent of respondents). And because the incidence of other sexually transmitted infections declined for these men, after the diagnosis, the scientists had reason to believe the self-reports of condom usage were accurate.

The U.K.’s new at-home HIV test won’t reach all the undiagnosed or guarantee that the people who test positive wind up receiving the care they need from a doctor, but letting people check their status quickly and accurately is likely to produce cascading positive effects, as HIV-positive people find it easier to seek care for themselves, warn past partners about exposure, and reduce risk for future partners. America needs to catch up.",1
"Kybella is aimed at destroying fat cells when injected in the area below the chin, while leaving surrounding tissue essentially unaffected. The FDA warned, however, that the treatment also has the potential to kill other types of cells, such as skin cells, if injected improperly.

Patients can receive as many as 50 injections of the drug in a single treatment, the agency said, with up to six treatments administered no less than a month apart. That might seem like a lot of pain for the pleasure of a slimmed-down chin, but currently patients looking to part with their double chins must have fat removed through more invasive means, such as liposuction.

The market for the new drug could be a big one.

According to a survey last year by the American Society for Dermatologic Surgery, nearly 70 percent of respondents listed ""excess fat under the chin/neck"" as a key concern about their appearance. And Americans repeatedly have demonstrated a willingness to shell out money for aesthetic treatments intended to improve their appearance, if not their overall health. A top example: Annual sales of the anti-wrinkle drug Botox have surged to $2 billion in recent years.

Keith Leonard, chief executive of Kythera, the California-based firm that developed Kybella, said at a conference last month that he believes the new treatment ""can drive a very large market and leave very satisfied patients.""

AD

The FDA said Kybella demonstrated safety and efficacy in two clinical trials involving more than 1,000 adults. A reduction in chin fat was ""observed more frequently"" in patients receiving the treatment than in those who got a placebo.

AD

That said, the agency warned Wednesday that the new drug can cause serious side effects, including trouble swallowing or nerve damage to the jaw that can result in an uneven smile or muscle weakness in the face. The most common side effects included swelling, bruising, pain, numbness, redness and areas of hardness in the vicinity of the injection. FDA officials said Kybella should be administered only by a ""licensed health care professional,"" and shouldn't be injected anywhere other than below the chin.

A Kythera representative said Wednesday that the new treatment likely won't be available until June, as it must train doctors to administer Kybella, and that the company would not have more details about the potential cost of the drug until after its launch.

"One in six American adults lives with high cholesterol, and millions have trouble getting it under control, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Now, researchers believe a a new type of experimental drug may help change that.

Researchers analyzed 24 randomized control trials to assess the efficacy and safety of the new drugs, called PCSK9 antibodies, in adults with high cholesterol levels. The antibodies target the cholesterol-regulating protein PCSK9 and lower the levels of LDL, the so-called ""bad"" cholesterol, by 60 percent.

The results, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, also show that the drugs have a significant effect on reducing heart attacks and overall mortality.

""It seems that the group that takes them, compared to the group that doesn't, has half the rate of cardiovascular events and mortality as those that don't,"" Dr. Seth S. Martin of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine told CBS News.

Current guidelines suggest cholesterol be treated with statins, a class of drugs that inhibit an enzyme that plays an important role in the production of cholesterol in the liver. But some patients can't tolerate the side effects, which can include headache, difficulty sleeping, muscle aches, diarrhea, constipation and nausea or vomiting.

Others have such high cholesterol that taking statins alone is not enough. These new drugs ""could be for someone who needs an addition to statin, or it could be instead of statin,"" Martin said.

HealthDay Reporter

SUNDAY, April 19, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Taking aspirin regularly over several years may help prevent gastrointestinal cancers, a new study suggests.

There was a 20 percent lower risk of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract, especially in the colon and rectum, among people taking aspirin, said lead researcher Yin Cao, a postdoctoral research fellow at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.

But Cao doesn't think people should start taking aspirin to prevent cancer until more research is done. ""The results of ongoing research to develop more tailored treatment based upon a personalized assessment of risks and benefits is critical before recommending aspirin for preventing cancer,"" she said.

Moreover, patients and their doctors need to consider the potential risks of taking aspirin, including stomach bleeding, Cao said.

However, ""if considered alongside the known benefits of aspirin in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes, our data suggest the possibility that long-term regular aspirin use may have a significant benefit in prevention of the two leading causes of sickness and death in the U.S. and much of the world,"" she said.

The results of the study were to be presented Sunday at an American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

For the study, Cao and her colleagues collected data on 82,600 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study in 1980 and 47,650 men enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study in 1986. The researchers collected data on aspirin use, risk factors for cancer and diagnoses of cancer.

After up to 32 years of follow-up, about 20,400 women and 7,570 men developed cancer, the investigators found. Among men, prostate cancer was excluded.

Cao's team found that men and women who took a regular dose of aspirin (325 milligrams) two times a week or more had a lower risk of cancer overall than people who did not regularly take aspirin. The reduced risk was largely due to fewer cases of gastrointestinal cancers, including colon cancer, rectal cancer and esophageal cancer.

Regular aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of other cancers. Specifically, no link was found between aspirin use and a lower risk of breast cancer, advanced prostate cancer or lung cancer, the researchers said.

Moreover, the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took. So the more aspirin taken, the more the risk was reduced. Amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to 15 or more, the researchers said.

Getting the biggest benefit from aspirin required taking it for at least 16 years. The benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it, the researchers found. And the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk, not a cause-and-effect relationship.

The association of aspirin with reduced cancer risk was the same for women and men regardless of race, history of diabetes, family history of cancer, weight, smoking, regular use of other painkillers or taking multivitamins, the study authors added.

Eric Jacobs, strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said the new study ""confirms the now well-established link between regular aspirin use and lower risk of developing certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract -- cancers of the colon, rectum and esophagus.""

Some, though not all, previous studies have indicated that aspirin might slightly lower risk of certain other cancers, including breast cancer, prostate cancer and lung cancer, he added.

""Although aspirin is recommended for most people who have had a heart attack, and has some benefits for cancer risk as well, at this point the American Cancer Society does not recommend that people use aspirin specifically to prevent cancer because it is not clear that the benefits with respect to cancer outweigh the risks,"" Jacobs said.

While not common, aspirin can cause serious, even occasionally fatal, stomach bleeding, even at low doses, he said.

""People who are uncertain about whether they should be using aspirin should talk to their health care provider, who knows their personal medical history and can help weigh their individual risks and benefits,"" Jacobs said.

"(Reuters) - A combination of two Bristol-Myers Squibb drugs that help the immune system fight melanoma led to significantly greater tumor shrinkage than treatment with one of the medicines, according to a midstage study presented on Monday.

The combination of Yervoy and the newer Opdivo also reduced the risk of disease progression by 60 percent compared with Yervoy alone through 11 months of follow-up in previously untreated patients with advanced melanoma, researchers found.

The overall response rate, defined as tumors that shrank by at least 30 percent, was 61 percent for the 72 patients who received the combination versus 11 percent among the 27 who got Yervoy alone.

Twenty-two percent of those combination patients had a complete response, meaning no sign of tumor. There were no complete responses with Yervoy alone.

“The response rates and the depth of responses are quite impressive,” Dr. Stephen Hodi, director of the Melanoma Center at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and co-lead author of the study, said in an interview.

The median time it took for Yervoy patients to see their cancer worsen was 4.4 months. But after 11 months, more than half of the combination group had yet to see their disease worsen. Overall survival data was not yet available.

“Longer follow-up will be helpful to see the durability of these responses and what happens to patients who had complete responses,” said Hodi, who presented data from the Checkpoint-069 study at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Philadelphia. The results were published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Yervoy, also known as ipilimumab, had been the first immunotherapy to extend survival in patients with advanced melanoma, the deadliest skin cancer. It works by taking the brakes off the immune system to more efficiently attack cancer. Opdivo (nivolumab) belongs to a promising new class of drugs called PD-1 inhibitors that block a mechanism tumors use to hide from the immune system.

In a separate group of 33 patients with a mutation of the BRAF gene involved in cancer cell growth, the overall response rate was 52 percent for the combination. The complete response rate was 22 percent. That compared with 1 percent overall response rate and no complete responses for Yervoy alone.

The combination of the two drugs also led to far higher levels of side effects, such as colitis and inflammation of lung tissue, at 54 percent versus 24 percent for Yervoy alone. Patients were also more likely to stop taking the combination of drugs.

“Most of the patients who stopped for toxicity continued to benefit,” said Fouad Namouni, Bristol’s head of development for Yervoy and Opdivo.",1
"Now scientists believe that they have a way to distinguish between those paths, at least in terms of language ability, in the toddler years using brain imaging.

In an article published Thursday in the journal Neuron, scientists at the University of California-San Diego have found that children with autism spectrum disorder, or ASD, with good language outcomes have strikingly distinct patterns of brain activation as compared to those with poor language outcomes and typically developing toddlers.

""Why some toddlers with ASD get better and develop good language and others do not has been a mystery that is of the utmost importance to solve,"" Eric Courchesne, one of the study’s authors and co-director of the University of California-San Diego's Autism Center, said in a statement.

The images of the children in the study -- MRIs of the brain -- were taken at 12 to 29 months while their language was assessed one to two years later at 30 to 48 months.

Such research has become critically important as the number of children diagnosed with autism has soared in recent decades to 1 in 68. Scientists have looked at numerous possible causes, from genetics to environmental exposure, but no definitive answers. Autism is considered by most experts to be a lifelong condition, but numerous studies have found that children's outcomes improve with early therapy. Hundreds of millions of dollars of state and federal funding are being spent each year to provide help to children and adults with autism and being able to pinpoint children at risk in the early years could help direct those public resources to where they could do the most good.

Brain imaging has become a popular subject of research in recent years as the technology to be able to scan, store and analyze the terabytes of information in the pictures has become more affordable. Scientists at a growing number of research centers are pinning their hopes that these images will help them unlock some of the secrets of everything from what causes childhood disorders like Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder to how neurons in the brain process vision and memory.

"Eating for two is exciting, but comes with a lot of baggage: weight gain, uncontrollable cravings for ice cream and pickles, and constant concern over whether your growing baby is getting all the nutrients it needs, to name a few.

Now, findings published in Applied Physiology, Nutrition and Metabolism reveal that most women aren’t getting enough omega-3 fatty acids – healthy fats found in fish, walnuts, avocados and supplements. Specifically, they aren’t getting enough DHA (docosahexaenoic acid), an omega-3 long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid (omega 3-LCPUFA) that's critical to a baby's brain development. DHA is primarily obtained by eating fish and other seafood.

For the study, researchers from Canada's University of Alberta studied 600 women during and after pregnancy to monitor their intake of omega 3-LCPUFAs. These include DHA, EPA (eicosapentaenoic acid) and DPA (docosapentaenoic acid). DHA is believed to be the biggest player in neurological health and is the primary structural fat found in the brain.

The American Dietetic Association recommends that healthy adults, including pregnant and lactating women, get at least 500 milligrams per day of omega 3-LCPUFAs. Meanwhile, the International Society for the Study of Fatty Acids and Lipids advises that pregnant and lactating women consume at least 200 mg of DHA per day.

The researchers found that only 27 percent of women during pregnancy and 25 percent of women three-months postpartum were meeting those DHA recommendations.

The Power of DHA

“Omega 3s are needed for the infant’s brain and nervous system to develop properly,” says contributing study author Catherine Field, a registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at the University of Alberta. “Also, the membranes of every cell in a person’s body contain omega-3 fatty acids. They are needed for the cell to grow and function.” After all, during pregnancy and breastfeeding, babies are doing at lot of growing.

What’s more, during pregnancy omega-3 fatty acids are required for mom’s body to produce more red blood cells so that she can provide enough nutrients and oxygen to her growing baby. These fatty acids also help the placenta grow and function as needed, Field says. It’s this placenta that omega-3 fatty acids including DHA diffuse across to reach the baby and spur brain development, says Dr. Vincenzo Berghella, past president of the Society for Maternal-Fetal Medicine as well as professor and director of the division of Maternal-Fetal Medicine at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia.

Not surprisingly, low intake of DHA in moms is linked to babies with lower cognitive development (often associated with crying and poor sleep) as well as lower IQs and attention deficit disorders, Field says. What’s more, her previous research in both animals and humans shows that DHA intake during breastfeeding impacts infants’ immune system development, which may explain why babies who receive low amounts of DHA through breast milk have an increased risk of asthma and allergies. She also notes that DHA supplementation may help prevent preterm labor, preeclampsia and postpartum depression.

However, whether DHA benefits more than babies' brain health isn't conclusive. “Data from observational studies and from randomized controlled trials suggest that omega-3 during pregnancy could be associated with several benefits such as lower risk of preterm birth, preeclampsia and other obstetrics complications. However, there are contradicting results,” Berghella says.

In fact, Berghella’s 2015 review of 34 randomized controlled trials found that omega-3 supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with decreases in risk. However, the review did find that women with single-child pregnancies (no multiples) had a 73 percent lower risk of stillbirth or early infant death if they began supplementation by 20 weeks into their pregnancies.

How to Get More DHA

Sushi’s one thing, but during pregnancy, you shouldn’t lay off seafood entirely, Berghella says. The American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women eat at least two servings of fish or shellfish (about 8 to 12 ounces) every week. But take care to choose low-mercury options such as shrimp, salmon and catfish. The group recommends avoiding shark, swordfish, king mackerel and tilefish, and limiting white tuna consumption to 6 ounces per week.

Hitting those recommendations will get you approximately 1,400 mg of DHA per week, Berghella says. (While that’s not exactly 200 mg per day, if you average your intake out over the course of a 7-day week, you still hit recommended amounts.) In the University of Alberta study, seafood, fish and seaweed products contributed to 79 percent of women’s omega 3-LCPUFA intakes from food. The biggest source: salmon. Good thing, as a 2007 study published in The Lancet found that children born to mothers who reported no seafood intake had the greatest risk of behavioral problems and poor scores on early developmental and IQ tests.

If you don’t eat seafood, DHA supplements can help, says Dr. Gabriele Saccone of the University of Naples Federico II’s department of neuroscience and Berghella’s collaborator. But if you do take supplements, opt for fish-oil varieties, since DHA from fish may be more beneficial than getting it from vegetarian supplements, according to Saccone. And no worries, they are low in mercury.

Even if you are eating some seafood – just not quite two servings per week – a fish-oil supplement could still help. In the current study, women who took a supplement were 11 times more likely to get 200 mg of DHA per week during pregnancy and lactation compared to those who went supplement-free. Apart from taking supplements, Field also recommends eating foods enriched with DHA, such as milk and eggs.

Wondering about avocados, walnuts and olive oil? While they are all filled with omega-3 fatty acids, they aren’t of the DHA variety. These plant sources of omega-3s contain ALA (alpha-linolenic acid), which, while good for you, has a hard time converting into DHA so that it can really benefit baby’s brain development, Berghella says. In North Americans and Europeans, only about 4 percent of all ALA consumed becomes EPA or DHA, Field says.",1
"The program worked. The women who took the 10-week stress-management class shortly after surgery reported feeling better and having fewer depressive symptoms such as anxiety than those who took a one-day, breast-cancer education session.

Jamie Stagl worries that women with breast cancer don't get enough help coping with their diagnosis. Cancer upends a woman's daily routine, her sense of her body, her vision of the future. There's almost nothing more stressful.

The women felt better one year after the course, five years later, and — according to a new study published last month in the journal Cancer — an average of 11 years later. (Stagl and her colleagues tracked down 100 of the original participants; another 30 had died; and 110 couldn't be found or didn't want to participate.)

The positive results surprised even Stagl. ""It's quite amazing,"" she said.

Stagl doesn't know whether the women are still using the techniques they were taught — which include mindfulness, deep breathing, visual imagery, cognitive behavioral therapy, and learning how to ask for help from friends and family. But the study suggests that they have internalized the strategies.

Women may be particularly receptive to these approaches when they're coping with a cancer diagnosis, said Laura S. Porter, an associate professor at Duke University Medical Center. ""This is really a teachable moment.""

The skills taught in the course are useful at many stressful moments, Porter said, not just when cancer is diagnosed. But most people aren't explicitly trained how to cope with stressful events.

""These are really good life skills,"" Porter said. ""While I certainly wouldn't say that anyone could take a 10-week course and be set for life, I think anyone could take a 10-week course and be much better at coping with stress.""

Next, the study team, led by Michael Antoni of the University of Miami, hopes to show that an easier-to-manage five-week group class works as well as the 10-week one.

And researchers want to know whether relaxation actually reduces the recurrence of breast cancer. It makes biological sense, Stagl said. Stress drives up levels of the hormone cortisol, which is known to weaken the immune system. If a woman's stress level remains high indefinitely after diagnosis, she may have a worse outcome than if she can bring it back down, Stagl said.

"The MIND diet: 10 foods that fight Alzheimer's (and 5 to avoid)





istockphoto Doctors have been saying for years that what you eat can affect the health of your heart. Now there's growing evidence that the same is true for your brain. A new study by researchers at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago shows a diet plan they developed -- appropriately called the MIND diet -- may reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease by as much as 53 percent. Even those who didn't stick to the diet perfectly but followed it ""moderately well"" reduced their risk of Alzheimer's by about a third. Diet appears to be just one of ""many factors that play into who gets the disease,"" said nutritional epidemiologist Martha Clare Morris, PhD, the lead author of the MIND diet study. Genetics and other factors like smoking, exercise and education also play a role. But the MIND diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against Alzheimer's regardless of other risk factors. The study, published in the journal Alzheimer's & Dementia, looked at more than 900 people between the ages of 58 and 98 who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing. It found participants whose diets most closely followed the MIND recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person 7.5 years younger. The MIND diet breaks its recommendations down into 10 ""brain healthy food groups"" a person should eat and five ""unhealthy food groups"" to avoid. It combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health: the Mediterranean diet and the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet. (MIND stands for Mediterranean-DASH Intervention for Neurodegenerative Delay.) But the MIND diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of Alzheimer's. Click through to see which foods to eat -- and which ones to avoid -- for optimal brain health.

Green leafy vegetables istockphoto The MIND diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables. Kale, spinach, broccoli, collards and other greens are packed with vitamins A and C and other nutrients. At least two servings a week can help, and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits. The Mediterranean and DASH diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables, but the MIND diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of Alzheimer's.

Other vegetables istockphoto Like other diets focused on weight loss and heart health, the MIND diet emphasizes the importance of vegetables for brain health. The researchers recommend eating a salad and at least one other vegetable every day to reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.

Nuts istockphoto Nuts are a good snack for brain health, according to the MIND diet study. Nuts contain healthy fats, fiber and antioxidants, and other studies have found they can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease. The MIND diet recommends eating nuts at least five times a week.

Berries istockphoto Berries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the MIND diet. ""Blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain,"" Morris said. She noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function. The MIND diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week.

Beans istockphoto If beans aren't a regular part of your diet, they should be. High in fiber and protein, and low in calories and fat, they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the MIND diet. The researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of Alzheimer's.

Whole grains Tom Perkins Whole grains are a key component of the MIND diet. It recommends at least three servings a day.

Fish istockphoto The MIND diet study found eating fish at least once a week helps protect brain function. However, there's no need to go overboard; unlike the Mediterranean diet, which recommends eating fish almost every day, the MIND diet says once a week is enough.

Poultry Shaiith Poultry is another part of a brain-healthy eating plan, according to the MIND diet. It recommends two or more servings a week.

Olive oil istockphoto Olive oil beat out other forms of cooking oil and fats in the MIND diet. The researchers found people who used olive oil as their primary oil at home saw greater protection against cognitive decline.

Wine istockphoto Raise a toast to the MIND diet: it recommends a glass of wine every day. Just one, though. Wine rounds out the list of of 10 ""brain healthy"" food groups that help protect against Alzheimer's: green leafy vegetables, other vegetables, nuts, berries, beans, whole grains, fish, poultry, olive oil and wine. Now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia...

Red meat juniart Red meat isn't banned in the MIND diet, but the researchers say you should limit consumption to no more than four servings a week to help protect brain health. That's more generous than the Mediterranean diet, which restricts red meat to just one serving a week.

Butter and stick margarine istockphoto Butter and stick margarine should be limited to less than a tablespoon per day on the MIND diet. Brain-healthy olive oil can often be used instead.

Cheese istockphoto Cheese may be delicious but it doesn't do your brain any favors, according to the MIND diet study. Eat cheese no more than once a week if you want to reduce your risk of Alzheimer's.

Pastries and sweets istockphoto You already know they're not so good for your waistline, and it turns out pastries and other sweets could have a negative effect on brain health as well. The MIND diet recommends limiting yourself to no more than five of these treats per week.",1
"Why Doctors Are Trying A Skin Cancer Drug To Treat A Brain Tumor

Enlarge this image toggle caption Dave Gershgorn/WNYC Dave Gershgorn/WNYC

MaryAnn Anselmo feared for the worst when she was diagnosed with a brain tumor called a glioblastoma in late 2013.

""You start doing research on that type of tumor, and you're saying, 'Oh my God, you're history.' It's like a death sentence,"" says, Anselmo, now 59.

Only for her it wasn't.

Anselmo's successful treatment shows how precision medicine — tailoring therapy to each patient's genetic needs — is beginning to transform cancer care.

At first, the outlook seemed grim. Although Anselmo's surgeon was able to surgically remove most of her tumor, she couldn't tolerate traditional chemotherapy that was the planned second step, and had to discontinue it.

toggle caption WNYC

The chemo failure was the latest in a string of personal setbacks.

The year before she was diagnosed with brain cancer, she'd lost her son to suicide. Weeks after that she was almost killed in a car crash outside a local mall. Her cancer was discovered after she had a dizzy spell, and her husband, Joseph, insisted she return to the hospital to have it checked out.

After all that, Anselmo and her husband weren't ready to give up on her cancer fight. He'd read about advances in targeted therapies — drugs that go after cancer cells at the molecular level.

The family sent samples of her tumor samples for genetic testing to several leading cancer hospitals. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, where she was being treated, also did its own sequencing. They all found the same thing. Anselmo's tumor had a BRAF mutation common in skin cancer, but very unusual for a brain tumor.

Her oncologist, David Hyman at Memorial Sloan Kettering, enrolled Anselmo into a new kind of drug trial. Called a basket trial, the study is designed to include people whose tumors have the same kind of genetic fingerprint regardless of where in the body the tumors are found.

Knowing more about the genetic mutations of a tumor enables doctors to find a potentially effective drug much more quickly and accurately. ""It's like you're in a parking lot,"" Hyman says. ""And you have a key to one of the cars in the parking lot. And so one option is just to go to each car and try to open the lock. The other is to know that it's the third car on the right. What we're doing now is we're saying, OK, this key fits that lock. And we're only going straight to that car.""

Today, Anselmo is doing well. She's been in the clinical trial for a year now, and continues to take Zelboraf (or vemurafenib generically) daily. The pills have kept her cancer from growing.

There are side effects, of course. She's lost some peripheral vision, though she's been able to compensate. And Zelboraf is expensive, though it's free to Anselmo because she's taking it as part of a study.

Now she can focus again on the things she loves, like singing. Anselmo, a jazz singer who performed under the stage name Mariel Larsen before her illness, is planning a comeback. She's back in training with her longtime vocal coach.

As this kind of genetic sequencing of tumors has become faster and cheaper, more patients have access to this technology. More doctors are taking advantage of the information to treat patients with a targeted approach.

""We took a disease where nothing really works for any length of time and we've given her a year of life, and hopefully much more, where she's been much better,"" Hyman, her oncologist, says.

Still, he cautions that the targeted treatments can't be considered cures. At some point the drug that is keeping Anselmo's cancer at bay could stop working. ""Every patient is different in how long it works,"" he says. ""We all have patients that have been on these drugs for years. But I don't know, I mean, I think if I was being honest eventually our expectation would be that it would stop working.""

There's no way to predict when. But in the meantime, patients like Anselmo are grateful to have time they wouldn't have had otherwise.

After all the misfortunes she's been through, it would be easy to think Anselmo has been incredibly unlucky. But she doesn't see it that way. No, she says after rehearsing for her comeback show, ""I'm the luckiest.""

HealthDay Reporter

MONDAY, March 23, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Vitamin D supplements may slow or prevent low-grade prostate cancer from progressing, a small new study suggests.

""Vitamin D decreases inflammation in tissues, and inflammation is a driver of cancer,"" explained Bruce Hollis, the study's lead researcher and a professor of pediatrics, biochemistry and molecular biology at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston.

For the study, researchers randomly assigned 37 men who elected to have their prostate removed to receive either 4,000 international units (IU) of vitamin D or an inactive placebo daily for 60 days before their operation.

When the prostate gland was examined after their surgery, researchers found that many who received vitamin D had improvements in their prostate tumors, while the tumors in the placebo group remained the same or got worse.

""In greater than 60 percent of those taking it, vitamin D actually made the cancer better,"" said Hollis.

Hollis reported that in some cases the tumor shrank and in others the cancer went away. However, the study was small, and results from a larger trial aren't expected for several years, he added.

Doctors often recommend a ""watch and wait"" period for men with low-grade, or less aggressive, prostate tumors. But many patients and their families aren't comfortable waiting and opt to have surgery before it's deemed medically necessary. These findings suggest that taking vitamin D might help reduce the need for such radical treatment.

But Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said that this study was too small to reach any definitive conclusion about the value of vitamin D in fighting prostate cancer.

""It's premature to make any conclusions,"" he said. The findings also need to be replicated in a much larger number of patients, D'Amico said.

D'Amico stressed that men should not start taking vitamin D supplements in hopes of slowing or curing prostate cancer.

Vitamin D, known as the ""sunshine vitamin,"" is produced by the body when it's exposed to sun. It's also found in fortified dairy products and fatty fish.

The study results were scheduled for presentation Monday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in Denver. Data and conclusions presented at meetings are usually considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

"Bone-health experts are making a new push to reduce rates of osteoporosis, with a particular focus on controlling the bone-wasting disease in men.

An important goal is to get greater numbers of men to be tested for osteoporosis when they come to a hospital or clinic with a fracture to the wrist, vertebrae or other bones that wasn’t from a major accident or trauma. Doctors call this a fragility fracture—one that results from a decrease in bone density.

A recent study of about 440 people over 50 years old found women were about three times as likely as men (53% versus 18%) to be tested using a bone-density scan after suffering a distal-radial fracture, or broken wrist, a common warning sign of early osteoporosis. The study, conducted by researchers at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston, was published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery.

Bare Bones Osteoporosis, commonly thought of as a women’s disease, also affects many men. Osteoporosis occurs when bone tissue breaks down faster than it is replaced, causing bones to become less dense and more likely to fracture.

A broken bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis. Breakages are most common in the wrist, spine or hip.

About half of women over age 50 will break a bone due to osteoporosis. As many as one in four men will suffer a breakage.

Men are twice as likely as women to die in the year following a hip fracture.

Bone density, which peaks between ages 20 and 30, declines with age and especially in women after menopause. A bone density test, a type of Xray, can diagnose osteoporosis.

The higher your bone density was at its peak, the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis. Sources: National Osteoporosis Foundati

The National Bone Health Alliance, a public-private partnership managed by the nonprofit National Osteoporosis Foundation, is nearing completion of a year-long pilot project at three hospitals to test programs called fracture-liaison services that make bone-density tests routine for patients over 50 with fragility fractures.

Such tests currently are recommended in the treatment guidelines of various medical groups. They also are regularly performed at some U.S. managed-care organizations, including Kaiser Permanente Southern California, and some national health-care systems, such as in the U.K. But experts say the majority of patients in the U.S., especially men, don’t get tested for osteoporosis after suffering a fragility fracture.

Osteoporosis is commonly thought of as a women’s disease, but as many as one in four men in the U.S. over the age of 50 will break a bone as a result of the condition, more than will have prostate cancer, according to the National Osteoporosis Foundation. By comparison, one out of two women will break a bone from osteoporosis. The disease also is a common cause of hip fractures, and men are twice as likely as women to die in the year after suffering a broken hip, says the Switzerland-based International Osteoporosis Foundation. The IOF made men the focus of World Osteoporosis Day in October and released an in-depth report called “Osteoporosis in Men: Why Change Needs to Happen.”

Robert Spezzano, 54, an assistant principal at an independent high school in Washington, D.C., fell off his bicycle in the fall, breaking his wrist and elbow. After surgery at MedStar Georgetown University Hospital, which is participating in the pilot project, he got a call from the hospital’s fracture-liaison-service coordinator suggesting he make an appointment for a bone-density test. “I was real skeptical, got real defensive about the term fragility fracture,” says Mr. Spezzano. “I fell hard, so I wasn’t surprised my arm broke.”

When the test results clearly showed osteoporosis, Mr. Spezzano says he was “blown away. My mind was racing. You just think it’s a woman’s disease.” Although his doctor recommended prescription medication, Mr. Spezzano says he plans first to sharply step up his exercise regimen and take vitamin D supplements to see if that helps.

Andrea Singer, leader of the project at MedStar Georgetown, says results of the pilot haven’t yet been compiled, but the number of patients post-fracture who are identified, assessed for osteoporosis and put on treatment if needed is up significantly.

Patients “aren’t necessarily thrilled with the diagnosis, but they’re thrilled that someone is looking at the whole person,” Dr. Singer says.

Bone tissue is always breaking down. When it isn’t replaced fast enough, bones become less dense and prone to breakage, even with a relatively minor fall or bump. Tests for osteoporosis include a bone-density scan, a type of X-ray of the hip, wrist or spine, and blood or urine tests to check calcium and vitamin D levels.

Bone density declines gradually as people age, and especially for women after menopause. Factors like family history and lifestyle contribute to people’s risk for getting osteoporosis. Some medications, such as corticosteroids or androgen-deprivation therapy for prostate cancer, and some underlying medical conditions also can promote the condition.

When osteoporosis isn’t too severe or the patient is relatively young, doctors may recommend calcium or vitamin D supplements, diet changes or more weight-bearing exercise, which strengthens bones. People with a greater risk of future fractures may be put on medications called bisphosphonates, which slow bone breakdown and slightly increase bone mass. Bisphosphonates, sold under brand names such as Fosamax and Actonel, are highly effective. But because of some possible, rare side effects—an unusual type of fracture of the thigh bone and a deterioration of the jaw bone—the medication often isn’t prescribed for more than five years.

Many men “think they can’t get osteoporosis. A man will say, ‘Oh, it was a really bad fall’,” says Richard Dell, head of Kaiser Permanente Southern California’s fracture-liaison service until he retired last year. Care managers at Kaiser order a bone-density scan for everyone over 50 whose fracture results from a simple fall. A clinic sees patients who have abnormal scans, does lab tests and prescribes treatment if needed.

Since the service was launched in 1997, the rate of hip fractures at Kaiser is down 40%, says Dr. Dell, an improvement he attributes in large part to the fracture-liaison service. Dr. Dell currently advises the National Osteoporosis Foundation on its effort to get more hospitals to adopt the services.

A key goal of the hospital pilot project, which is funded by Merck & Co., the maker of Fosamax, is to find out if a fracture-liaison service can be effective in a non-managed-care environment. Among other things, the project has been testing systems to keep track of patients who might receive follow-up care from multiple providers. It eventually plans to make the systems available to hospitals launching such services.

Although managed-care-hospital networks can save money by reducing hip fractures in their patients, other hospitals stand to forgo $25,000 or more for every hip surgery they don’t perform. Many experts believe fracture-liaison services will be more widely adopted once Medicare, the big government insurer, pegs more of its payments to patients’ overall health outcomes.

“When they put in more pay-for-performance programs, that’s when it will really get attention,” says Douglas Dirschl, chairman of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation at University of Chicago Medicine, which isn’t participating in the pilot project. Fracture-liaison services represent “the best chance we have” for getting men and women evaluated and treated for osteoporosis, he says.",1
"Diseases like Alzheimer’s start years, even decades, before the first symptoms of memory loss shows up. And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians—not neurology experts—will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available.

“If we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for Alzheimer’s disease, that would help,” says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer’s Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, “but we don’t.” But Petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released Wednesday in the journal Neurology, his Alzheimer’s test has promise.

Petersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment. Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. “What we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,” he says.

In the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients’ medical charts—their age, family history of Alzheimer’s, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer’s, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory.

In the next phase they studied the results of the patient’s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer’s.

And another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease—how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. “We were a little surprised,” says Petersen. “But what’s nice about it is that it’s a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it’s looking at another aspect of brain function.”

MORE: This Alzheimer’s Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer

Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes — a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues — should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer’s, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene.

Currently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer’s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. “We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it’s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,” says Petersen.

MORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer’s 10 Years Before Diagnosis

While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it’s recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. But those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores.

For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn’t much they can do to interrupt the process. But they can direct them toward clinical trials of promising new drugs to address Alzheimer’s dementia, which may slow the cognitive decline considerably.

Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.

An easy, two-minute vision test administered on the sidelines after a young athlete has hit his or her head can help to reliably determine whether the athlete has sustained a concussion, according to a new study of student athletes, some as young as 5.

The test is so simple and inexpensive that any coach or parent potentially could administer it, the study’s authors believe, and any league afford to provide it as a way to help evaluate and safeguard players.

Those of us who coach or care for young athletes know by now that an athlete who falls or collides with something during play or seems dazed, dizzy, loses consciousness or complains of head pain should be tested for a concussion, which occurs when the brain is physically jostled within the skull.

But most of us are clueless about how to test young athletes. The most commonly recommended sideline test is the Standardized Assessment of Concussion, a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date, describe how they feel, memorize and recall lists of words, and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination. Ideally, this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional.

But while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers, few high schools and youth leagues have those resources. Most of the time, concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience.

That situation prompted researchers at New York University’s Langone Concussion Center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other, easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions.

Their thoughts soon turned to vision.

“About 50 percent of the brain’s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing,” said Dr. Steven Galetta, chairman of neurology at N.Y.U. Langone Medical Center and senior author of the study, which was published in The Journal of Neuro-Ophthalmology.

Eye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone’s brain is working.

But for the most part, visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes.

However, the N.Y.U. researchers knew that in recent years, trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts, where concussions are common, had begun supplementing the Standardized Assessment with a simple vision exam, known as the King-Devick test, during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible. (See below for more information.) The King-Devick test measures rapid eye movement, visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems. If an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing, he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion.

The test requires no medical training.

But it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes. So the N.Y.U. researchers decided to test it.

They recruited 243 young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of 5 and 18, and 89 collegians from the same sports.

These athletes all completed a baseline Standardized Assessment of Concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow 10-foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance. They also completed the King-Devick test.

Then they went out to play.

During their subsequent competitive seasons, 12 athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches, under the supervision of N.Y.U. medical personnel. Fourteen age-matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests, to serve as controls.

Neurologists later confirmed that the 12 injured athletes had sustained concussions.

Then the N.Y.U. researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury.

The Standardized Assessment of Concussion had performed rather miserably, correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes, missing 10, and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion, since their scores had declined compared with their baseline (almost certainly, the study’s authors believe, because these young athletes were physically tired).

The King-Devick test did much better, correctly assessing concussion in 75 percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one.

The pace-along-the-tape test was also relatively accurate. Ten of the 12 injured athletes were slower now, but so were five of the unhurt players.

Overall, the King-Devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives.

The upshot, Dr. Galetta believes, is that parents and coaches “should absolutely consider” familiarizing themselves with the King-Devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts, then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines.

If an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers, Dr. Galetta said, it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor.

It is still too early to say, however, whether the King-Devick test can replace other, more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes, including the standardized assessment, despite its shortcomings in this study, Dr. Galetta cautioned. For now, he says, it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests.

How to Administer the King-Devick Concussion Test

During preseason, use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible. The cards should be read in order. This establishes a baseline time. For the greatest precision, you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading.

During the season, if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion, have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines. If the time is slower, even by a small amount, he or she probably has a concussion, according to neurologists.

Interestingly, uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices, because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested.

"(CNN) By the time Cynthia Falardeau read about Alex Pring, a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer, she had made peace with her son Wyatt's limb difference.

Her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands. At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was.

Wyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months.

""His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,"" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary.

So when a friend shared a story from the ""Today Show"" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive.

""He doesn't need this,"" she thought.

Her fifth-grader had a different reaction: ""I want one of these robot arms!"" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. ""I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!""

There were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had.

Falardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free.

The UCF team, which operates a nonprofit called Limbitless Solutions , is special because it's the only group in the 3-D volunteer network making electronic arms. Most 3-D arms are mechanical, which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep.

""It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?"" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. ""It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about.""

The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt.

The UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free.

""My mother taught us that we're supposed to help change the world,"" Manero said at the time. ""We're supposed to help make it better.""

The students were blown away by what happened after that. The ""Today Show"" and other national news outlets featured stories about Alex and Manero, and then they got international attention. Families in more than 25 countries have asked the UCF students to help their children. In February, Microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world.

Each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations.

Petresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics.

""He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,"" he said. ""I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world.""

Eventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando.

Petresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can ""not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them.""

As they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's ""Frozen,"" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from ""Blue Man Group."" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from ""Transformers.""

""We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,"" Petresky said. ""There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative.""

The team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close.

He expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month.

His mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is.

""The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,"" she wrote in her iReport. ""Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children.""

As they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. And someday, he said, he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him.",1
"Colorectal cancers kill more Americans than any other cancer except lung cancer, but a new study suggests you can reduce your risk of the disease by laying off the cheeseburgers and pastramis and opting for a large salad or broiled salmon instead.

After tracking 77,659 Americans and Canadians for an average of more than seven years, researchers from Loma Linda University found that vegetarians were 22% less likely than meat-eaters to be diagnosed with colon cancer or rectal cancer. The results were published Monday by JAMA Internal Medicine.

The study volunteers were all members of the Seventh Day Adventist church, which strongly encourages a vegetarian diet. (The church also urges followers to exercise regularly and refrain from smoking, drinking or using mind-altering substances.)

As a result, the researchers didn’t just compare vegetarians to non-vegetarians. They were also able to assess the relative merits of different types of vegetarian diets. Here’s how they stacked up:

Advertisement

By far, the lowest incidence of colorectal cancers was seen in pesco-vegetarians, people who eat fish at least once a month but eschew all other types of meat. Compared to omnivores, pesco-vegetarians were 43% less likely to be diagnosed with these cancers during the course of the study.

Lacto-ovo vegetarians (who eat eggs and dairy foods but not fish or other meats) came in second, with an 18% reduced incidence of colorectal cancer. They were followed closely by vegans (who don’t eat eggs, dairy products or any kind of meat), who were 16% less likely to get a colorectal cancer diagnosis.

Even semi-vegetarians (who ate meat at least once per month but no more than once per week) were 8% less likely to get colorectal cancer during the study period than never-vegetarians, the researchers found.

All of these risk-reduction calculations were adjusted to account for age, gender, race, education level, daily calorie intake, exercise habits, smoking and drinking behavior, family history of colorectal cancer, and other medical conditions.

The researchers also crunched the numbers separately for colon cancer and rectal cancer. In this analysis, being a vegetarian (of any type) reduced the risk of colon cancer more than rectal cancer.

Previous studies have found that eating red meat – especially processed meat – is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer, and eating fiber is known to reduce the risk. So it’s not exactly surprising that vegetarians fared better than meat-eaters in this study.

But some of the details remain mysterious. For instance, the vegetarians in this study ate fewer foods with refined grains, added fats and sugar than their non-vegetarian counterparts. The study authors even said it will take more research to determine whether the pesco-vegetarians were better off because they ate fish.

"GOTHENBURG, SWEDEN (Reuters) - A wearable device that stimulates the sense of balance with electric “noise” could help Parkinson’s disease patients, according to Swedish scientists.

Scientists from the University of Gothenburg’s Sahlgrenska Academy have developed a portable pocket-sized vestibular, or balance, stimulation device in a bid to improve the lives of Parkinson’s sufferers.

The research was led by Associate Professor Filip Bergquist, who said the simple device was similar to the TENS (Transcutaneous Electrical Nerve Stimulation) therapy which is used for pain relief, for example in child birth.

“So this is really not a very complicated device. It is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves, what’s called TENS. The difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance. So you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving, you actually do not feel anything,” Bergquist explained.

The device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient’s head behind the ears, where the vestibular system is located.

Parkinson’s disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine, a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another. Symptoms of advanced Parkinson’s disease include an impaired sense of balance, as well as tremors, poor mobility, slowness and stiffness.

Nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa, a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain. The effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as Parkinson’s disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements, or dyskinesia.

In earlier experiments on rats, researchers at Sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain, thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals’ motor skills and balance.

The researchers have also tested the method on ten Swedish Parkinson’s patients, in both medicated and unmedicated states. According to Sahlgrenska, on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment, not knowing which day the current was active. According to the research institute, the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients’ balance and the combined symptoms.

Parkinson’s sufferer Staffan Lindblom said he did not expect any great advances, but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier.

“I have become hardened in the sense that I do not have too great expectations. But I still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful. There is extensive research in this field and I hope that it eventually will come up with a result. Not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated,” he said.

Unfortunately this particular treatment did not work on Lindblom, with Bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to Lindblom’s balance problems.

Bergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the Levodopa drug, which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical, was not enough.

He also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system, such as ADHD (Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder), could also benefit from this kind of treatment.

“What we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where Levodopa, Parkinson’s disease where Levodopa is not enough. And in particular in patients with Parkinson’s disease where there is problem with gait and balance. But this may not be restricted to Parkinson’s disease, so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs, the balance organs to improve balance and gait,” he said.

The plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer-term study, where patients will be using it at home. If those trials prove successful, the developers hope the device could be available to the public within five years.",1
"New research leaves little doubt about it: Fitness is powerful. A new study shows it’s also a powerful predictor of whether an individual will live or die in the next decade.

Put a person on a standard-issue treadmill, crank up the speed and the incline, measure the maximum metabolic equivalents of task she achieves and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate she can endure, and you have two key bases on which to predict a patient’s 10-year survival prospects, says a study published Monday in the Mayo Clinic Proceedings.

The resulting “FIT Treadmill score,” say researchers from Johns Hopkins University, “is easily attainable from any standardized exercise test and translates basic treadmill performance measures into a fitness-related mortality risk score.”

The predictor also takes into account a patient’s age and sex. Once computed, the FIT Treadmill score was not improved by taking into account a wide range of measures often used to assess risk, including blood pressure, obesity, cholesterol readings, family history, medication use and the Framingham Risk Score.

The study plumbed the records of 58,020 patients in the Detroit area who were referred for a stress test because they reported chest pain, shortness of breath, palpitations or dizziness, among other things. Researchers checked the medical records for a median of 10 years after each stress test to see if a death -- of any cause -- was recorded. A total of 6,456 of these patients, who ranged in age from 18 to 96, died.

Looking back at the treadmill performance of those who lived and those who died, the researchers generated a scale ranging from -200 to 200 to convey an individual’s likelihood of dying of any cause over the next 10 years.

“The notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new, but we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age, gender and fitness level, and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test,” says lead investigator Dr. Haitham Ahmed, a cardiology fellow at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Patients with a score between 100 and 200 have a 98% likelihood of surviving the next decade, the researchers said. Those with scores between 0 and 100 have a 97% probability of survival. Patients who turn in a performance yielding a score between 0 and -100 have an 89% likelihood of 10-year survival. And those with a score between -100 and -200 have a 62% probability of surviving.

Probabilities may not grab all patients by the collar. But telling someone he or she has a better than 1-in-3 chance of dying before the next decade’s out (or even a better than 1-in-10 chance) would probably be a sobering reminder to hit the gym. The authors said the metric “can be used to communicate fitness-related risk and motivate behavioral change after exercise stress testing.”

Do-it-yourself stress testing is probably not very reliable, since a physician or sports physiologist needs to be around to decide when to call a halt to the test (and therefore what maximum a test-taker has achieved).

But if you think you’d like to try, and can do a relatively simple computation, you can use the metabolic equivalents (METS) and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate (%MPHR), which are both available on most cardio machines at the gym, to calculate your own survival prospects. Here’s the magic formula:

FIT Treadmill Score = %MPHR + 12 (METS) - 4 (age) + 43 (if female)

"Going for a jog on a treadmill can predict how long you’re going to live, a large new study suggests.

Researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine looked at standard treadmill stress test results for more than 58,000 subjects, ages 18 to 96. After age and sex, the two best predictors of whether the patient would be alive in ten years was how highly activated their metabolism was and how fast their heart would beat during the test.

Metabolism was calculated using ""metabolic equivalent of tasks"" or METs, a measure of how much energy someone expends during a task. The higher MET level achieved, the more likely it was the subject would last another decade.

The closer someone came to reaching their maximum heart rate as they ran, the less likely they were to die within ten years, compared to someone who only reached about 85 percent of their maximum heart rate during the test. Maximum heart rate was determined by subtracting the subject’s age from 220, a formula that’s been used for decades by exercisers and doctors alike.

Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News medical contributor, explained the science behind the test on ""Good Morning America.""

“In medicine we usually base predictions of survival on the absence or presence of a disease state,” she said. “What’s new here is that there is now a fancy equation doctors can use to compare the chances of survival for one 50-year-old woman against another 50-year-old woman.”

Rather than being viewed as morbid, experts should be able to use this information to motivate people to change their behavior, Ashton said. Everyone can improve their survival score by exercising more often and pushing it a little harder when they do, she added.

“This is in your power to change and improve your numbers. You can actually change your own destiny,” she said.",1
"Staying sexually active—and considering sexuality an important part of life—may be linked to higher cognitive functioning as people age, according to a study in the March issue of the American Journal of Geriatric Psychiatry.

Older men and women who were satisfied with their sexual relationships and considered sexuality an essential component of aging performed better on tests of cognitive function than those who felt sexuality and intimacy were unimportant, the research showed.

Previous studies have focused on the prevalence of sexual activity in older people. But the influence of cognitive decline on how sexuality is perceived in later life wasn’t known, researchers said.

The study, conducted in the Netherlands, involved 1,747 men and women from a larger study of aging. The subjects were 71 years old, on average. About three-quarters had partners. Researchers assessed cognitive function with tests of memory, mental processing speed, general cognitive function and fluid intelligence, or the ability to reason and think abstractly.

Subjects responded to four questions about the importance of sexuality personally and to older people generally, and about their current sex life and need for intimacy and touching with aging. Chronic diseases, depression and medications were recorded.

A quarter of the subjects rated their current or personal sexuality as important or very important, while 41% rated it as unimportant. Nearly 28% agreed that sexuality at an older age isn’t important anymore; 42% felt it was important.

Current sexual activity was considered pleasant and unpleasant by 32% and 6%, respectively, but 67% believed intimacy and touching are still needed in older people, while 12% didn’t agree.

Subjects who didn’t see the importance of sexual behavior or a need for intimacy, and who considered their current sexuality unimportant and their sex life unpleasant, had lower average cognitive scores compared with those who felt sexuality was important and were satisfied with their current sexual activity. The association between lower cognitive functioning and the belief that sexuality was unimportant was significant in both sexes, but seemed stronger in women, researchers said.

Caveat: The study didn't include subjects with severe cognitive impairment. Causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldn’t be determined.

The Perception of Sexuality in Older Adults and Its Relationship with Cognitive Functioning

Running injuries: Regular shoe changes—and playing different sports—may reduce the risk of injury in recreational runners, suggests a study in the current issue of the Scandinavian Journal of Medicine & Science in Sports.

Running involves the repetition of a large number of almost identical movements with very few variations, which can lead to overuse injuries, researchers said. Alternating shoes and sports may help to vary the musculoskeletal load, the study suggests.

In 2012, researchers in Luxembourg recruited 264 recreational runners, 69 women and 195 men in their early 40s, for the 22-week study. More than half, 56%, alternated approximately four pairs of running shoes of different makes or models, on average, while 44% mostly wore the same pair.

The subjects used an electronic database to record their weekly running and other sports activities, including the type of activity, duration, intensity, distance and shoe use. Pain in the lower back or legs that developed during exercise and prevented normal activity was recorded, along with the day the sport was resumed.

A third of participants reported at least one running-related injury during the study. Most of the injuries affected muscles and tendons and 36% lasted up to a month or longer.

Runners who wore more than one pair of shoes had a 39% lower risk of injury than those who wore the same pair during almost all running sessions, the adjusted results showed. Multiple shoe users wore the main pair 58% of the time during the study period, while other runners wore the same shoes 91% of the time.

Runners with multiple shoes participated in other sports for close to two hours a week, about twice the amount of time spent by single-shoe runners, and were more regular in their training and experienced in competitions.

Caveat: The study was relatively short, which may have limited the number of reported injuries, researchers said.

Can parallel use of different running shoes decrease running-related injury risk?

Response shift: People treated for chronic hand eczema may take a rosier view of the disease after it improves, playing down the severity of their worst outbreak, a study found. This change in perception, called a response shift, could adversely affect the behaviors patients use to manage the disease, according to a report in the March issue of Contact Dermatitis.

A response shift is particularly important in clinical studies, as it may result in flawed reporting of treatment effects, the study said. Taking regular photographs of skin areas affected by eczema could help counteract a response shift by patients, researchers suggest.

Eczema affects an estimated 10.2% of U.S. adults, according to the National Eczema Association, a nonprofit research organization. Hand eczema is a fluctuating disease that has been shown to seriously affect patients’ quality of life, the study said.

Researchers in Denmark recruited 224 patients with hand eczema, 145 women and 79 men ages 18 to 70. Quality of life and eczema severity were assessed with two questionnaires six months apart. Subjects rated the severity of their current eczema and their worst outbreak on a scale from 0 (none) to 10 (extremely bad) at both time points.

Close to two-thirds, 61.2%, rated their current eczema lower on the second assessment, at 3.5, on average, compared with 4.7 on the first assessment, indicating an improvement, researchers said. Eczema was unchanged or worse in 38.8%. But 49.1% of subjects rated their worst-ever eczema outbreak at 8, on average, at the second assessment and 8.5 on the first, a statistically significant change that indicated a response shift, researchers said.

Caveat: The six-month follow-up period was relatively short, researchers said.

SUNDAY, March 1, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A procedure that delivers the anesthetic lidocaine (Xylocaine) directly to nerves in the back of the nasal cavity appears to offer significant relief to migraine sufferers, preliminary research indicates.

Early findings suggest that a single outpatient treatment can reduce migraine pain levels by about 35 percent for up to a month after the procedure, according to this small, ongoing study.

The technique is ""a minimally invasive treatment option,"" said the study's lead author Dr. Kenneth Mandato, a vascular and interventional radiologist at Albany Medical Center in Albany, N.Y. He added that he views the new procedure as ""a clear simple alternative"" to standard migraine treatments.

""This nasal spray option is safe, convenient and innovative,"" said Mandato.

In the new study, his team focused on 112 patients averaging about 45 years of age. All had been diagnosed with either migraines or another type of intensely painful (and cyclically occurring) headache known as cluster headaches.

Before participating in the study, patients were asked to indicate their pain levels according to a standardized scale from 1 to 10. Pre-treatment pain scores averaged more than 8, Mandato said.

The participants all underwent a session of ""image-guided therapy,"" in which a spaghetti-sized catheter was inserted through a nostril and into the nasal passage to deliver a dose of lidocaine to a nerve center known as the sphenopalatine ganglion. This was then repeated in the opposite nostril, according to the researchers.

Mandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure.

The target nerve bundle, explained Mandato, ""resembles a complex highway crossing with many [nerve] signals and exits going in all directions."" And, he said, the hope was that lidocaine would essentially short-circuit that bundle's headache-causing pathway.

The day after the procedure, average migraine pain levels had dropped from about 8 to just over 4. Pain scores rose only marginally a week after the procedure, and reached an average of just over 5 by the one month post-procedure mark, according to the study.

The procedure didn't help everyone, though. Seven of the patients (about 6 percent) failed to get any benefit from the treatment, the investigators found. However, 88 percent of those in the study reported needing less standard pain relief medication after the procedure.

The researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated. Mandato said his team is continuing to monitor patients to see how well the nasal spray approach holds up six months out.

Dr. Richard Lipton, director of the Montefiore Headache Center in New York City, described the findings as ""very dramatic.""

""Unmet treatment needs in chronic migraine are huge, as is the overuse of medications,"" he noted. ""When a body gets used to having a chronic headache suppressor, the patient can experience a rebound in the absence of that suppressor. So developing an effective treatment that can reduce the need for acute medicine would be very valuable,"" Lipton explained.

""These results sound very promising,"" Lipton added. ""Of course, it remains to be seen if the demonstrated benefit already seen holds up over a longer period of time, and with a bigger group of patients.""

Mandato and colleagues are scheduled to present their findings Sunday at the Society of Interventional Radiology annual meeting in Atlanta. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The study received no funding from private industry.

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 25, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- After undergoing weight-loss surgery, women are significantly less prone to diabetes during pregnancy but twice as likely to deliver smaller-than-normal infants, a new study suggests.

Swedish scientists found that weight-loss (or ""bariatric"") surgery before pregnancy lowers the chances of certain complications for mothers and babies but raises the odds for others. They recommended any pregnancy after weight-loss surgery be considered high-risk and receive stricter monitoring.

""The number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades,"" said study author Kari Johansson, a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at Karolinska Institute in Stockholm. ""Consequently, there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery,"" she added.

""The positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes -- such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease -- are reasonably well-studied, but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and [post-delivery] outcomes,"" Johansson pointed out.

The study was published online Feb. 26 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

U.S. health officials say more than one-third of American adults are obese, with a body mass index (BMI, a height-weight calculation) of 30 or higher.

Nearly 179,000 obese people underwent weight-loss surgery in the United States in 2013, according to the American Society for Metabolic and Bariatric Surgery. While various techniques may be used, the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and/or reduces the intestines' absorption of calories and nutrients from food.

Johansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide Swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly 600 women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than 2,300 women who hadn't had the surgery but had the same BMI.

Only 2 percent of women who had weight-loss surgery developed gestational diabetes, compared to 7 percent of the other group, the researchers said. The surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger-than-normal babies.

However, the weight-loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age, and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration. Additionally, the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths, the study found.

The investigators didn't examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients, or higher stillbirths. But Johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery, with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition.

""It has been reported that gastric bypass [a form of bariatric surgery] increases the risk of protein, iron, vitamin B12, vitamin D and calcium deficiencies,"" she said. ""Also, many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant. Continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth.""

Because obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies -- including birth defects, gestational diabetes, high blood pressure, premature birth and even childhood obesity -- efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health and Science University's School of Medicine.

But Caughey, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research, said women considering weight-loss surgery should make the decision based on the long-term health benefits of the procedure -- not on potential pregnancy-related benefits.

""I don't think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale,"" said Caughey. ""I don't think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome.""

Caughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight-loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high-risk.

He also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight-loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until 12 to 24 months after the procedure, the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs.

""I think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies, a maternal-fetal medicine doctor, is a good idea,"" Caughey said.

"Here’s a bit of good news for folks who enjoy sitting in a super-heated room and sweating profusely: Finnish researchers say regular sauna bathing may help men to live longer.

The study, which was published Monday in JAMA, is the latest in a series of papers to explore the potential cardiovascular health benefits of “chilling out” in a room heated to 174-degrees Fahrenheit.

“Our results suggest that sauna bathing is a recommendable health habit,” wrote Dr. Jari Laukkanen, a cardiologist a the Institute of Public Health and Clinical Nutrition, University of Eastern Finland.

The only catch is, nobody can explain exactly why this is the case.

“Further studies are warranted to establish the potential mechanism that links sauna bathing and cardiovascular health” wrote Laukkanen and his colleagues.

The researchers based their conclusion on a database of of 2,315 Finnish men who have had their health tracked since 1984. Study participants were all aged 42 to 60, with a median age of 53.

Those men who enjoyed a sauna two or three times a week had a 23% lower risk of experiencing a fatal episode of coronary heart disease or cardiovascular disease, compared to those who took just one sauna a week, according to researchers.

The apparent health benefits for men who used the sauna four to seven times a week was even greater: They had a 48% lower risk of similar incidents when compared to men who used the sauna only once a week, researchers said.

“The higher frequency of sauna bathing was related to considerable decreased risks of sudden cardiac death, fatal coronary heart disease, fatal cardiovascular disease and all-cause mortality,” the authors wrote.

The researchers said a similar health benefit was unlikely to be found in steam rooms and hot tubs, due to the unique conditions of Finnish saunas.

A traditional Finnish sauna has dry air (10% to 20% humidity) and a recommended temperature of 176 degrees to 212 degrees. Humidity is increased temporarily by throwing water on the hot rocks of the sauna heater, and most Finns are accustomed to using a sauna once a week.

On average, the men in the study used a sauna twice a week, at a temperature of about 174 degrees. The average time spent in the sauna was about 14 minutes, researchers say.

The super-heated conditions of a sauna provoke a variety of physical reactions.

Heart rate can climb to 100 or 150 beats per minute -- similar to low- or moderate-intensity exercise -- and sweat is secreted at a rate of about 2 pounds per hour.

High temperatures also causes the body to flow more blood to the skin and less to internal organs.

“Previous studies have suggested that sauna bathing might have some harmful effects, whereas our results indicated a protective effect,” the authors wrote.

The researchers noted that only 1% to 2% of sudden deaths occurred within 24 hours of sauna bathing. Alcohol intake was a major contributing factor in those cases, authors wrote.

In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Rita Redberg, a cardiologist and professor of medicine at the University of California San Francisco, speculated on a number of possible reasons for the observed benefits.

“Although we do not know why the men who took saunas more frequently had greater longevity (whether it is the time spent in the hot room, the relaxation time, the leisure of a life that allows for more relaxation time, or the camaraderie of the sauna), clearly time spent in the sauna is time well spent,” Redberg wrote.

"For those plagued with peanut allergies, protection may eventually come in the form of a patch worn on the skin, a new study suggests.

Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images

In the second phase of a drug trial, half of participants wearing the highest dose “peanut patches” for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting, researchers reported Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma, and Immunology.

It means that “they are not going to have to worry about traces of peanut in a package that came from a plant where peanuts were used or minor contamination of food in a restaurant,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Hugh Sampson, a professor of pediatrics at the Icahn School of Medicine and director of the Jaffe Food Allergy Institute at Mount Sinai.

That's a potentially life-saving development. Consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction. About 15 million Americans have food allergies, including 1 in 13 children, according to the Food Allergy Research and Education (FARE) group. Eight foods account for 90 percent of all reactions: milk, eggs, peanuts, tree nuts, soy, wheat, fish and shellfish.

Unlabeled allergens are a leading cause of food recalls in the U.S. and the number of food allergy-related visits to hospitals are on the rise, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The FDA recently warned people with peanut allergies to avoid foods containing ground cumin, after traces of peanut powder were found in the ground spice.

In the skin patch trial, the international team of researchers randomly assigned 221 volunteers, ages 6 to 55, to wear a placebo patch or a patch containing peanut protein at one of three doses: 50 micrograms, 100 micrograms or 250 micrograms.

At the end of a year, 50 percent of those wearing the high-dose 250 microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein. The same dose worked for nearly 54 percent of kids, 6 to 11.

The skin patch — intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen — may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under-the-tongue therapy.

“Many have been told all their lives that if they ingest peanuts they will have a severe reaction and die,"" he said. ""So it’s tough to get them to take it. With this you just slap a little patch on their backs.”

Although some volunteers experienced redness and itchiness at the site of the patch, there were no serious side effects. Just two dropped out because of flare-ups of eczema.

“The goal for most practicing allergists and for most parents is to get a child to the point where if there is an accidental ingestion of peanut it would not be as risky or life-threatening,” said Dr. Amy Stallings, an assistant professor of pediatrics in the division of allergy and immunology at the Duke University Medical Center who is not affiliated with the new study. “And the patch may be a way of doing this that is safer.”

The patch study's results are promising, although researchers need to continue following the participants for another year, Sampson said. It could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers.

Researchers are trying to discover why food allergies have increased among children — the number of kids living with peanut or tree nut allergies tripled between 1997 and 2008, studies show — but there’s no clear answer. Allergies to peanuts and tree nuts tend to begin in childhood and are usually lifelong.",1

"Surgeons sometimes fly blind when operating on hard-to-reach anatomical parts or hard-to-see conditions. For visual references inside the brain or body, they often rely on images and scans taken before an operation.

A growing number of hospitals are equipping operating suites with magnetic resonance imaging, CT scanners and other technology that enables surgeons to scan a patient in real time, without having to move them from the operating table.

The resulting real-time 3D visuals—known as “intraoperative imaging”—help surgeons excise tumors and tissue with greater accuracy, reducing risks, such as nicked nerves from an errant knife, and the potential need for repeat surgery. The images also help surgeons spot bleeding, blood clots or other unexpected complications outside their field of vision.

Intraoperative imaging allows surgeons to perform “significantly better” than conventional surgery, says Sohail Mirza, medical director of the Center for Surgical Innovation and chairman of orthopedics at the Dartmouth-Hitchcock health system in Lebanon, N.H., affiliated with Dartmouth College’s medical school.

“We still need a surgeon’s training and judgment,” Dr. Mirza says, “but we can use three-dimensional deep imaging to get past the limitations of human error and hand-eye coordination.” Dartmouth-Hitchcock opened the $20 million center last year with financing from a National Institutes of Health grant and its own funds. MRI and CT scanners mounted on ceiling rails slide in and out of four sterile operating and procedure rooms.

The technology, first developed for use in complex brain surgeries, now is expanding for use in spinal cord surgery, biopsies and removal of tumors and lesions in the breast, lung, prostate, liver, pancreas and kidneys. Researchers are studying other ways the technology can help diagnose and treat cancer and other diseases.

Doctors used real-time MRI and CT scan images to remove a complicated tumor last year from the spine of Jack Deliso, 9, center. With him are his parents, Lisa and Michael, and sisters Chloe, left, and Rigney. Photo: Michael Deliso

The real-time scans can show surgeons whether tissue or organs have shifted during an operation, and where the border of a lesion ends and healthy tissue begins. In radiation treatment, doctors using the scans can see when a tumor shifts and pause to spare healthy tissue. The images can also provide better visualization of masses that are completely out of sight. Studies have found that in 40% of cases, brain surgeons will modify what they are doing based on an intraoperative MRI scan.

“This is precision medicine at its best, using an individual patient’s images to guide their procedure,” says Clare Tempany, co-director of the Advanced Multimodality Image-Guided Operating Suite program (known as Amigo) at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. The program is part of the hospital’s federally-funded National Center for Image-Guided Therapy, which is researching the use of intraoperative imaging in a variety of procedures and treatments including its cost-effectiveness. Since Amigo opened in 2011, 700 patients have undergone surgery including lung biopsies and breast-conserving tumor removal.

The need for more accuracy is real. As many as 40% of women who have breast-conserving surgery known as lumpectomy followed by radiation need a second operation because positive cells remain. At Brigham and Women’s researchers are looking at how to improve surgeons’ ability to determine the exact margins of tumors using intraoperative MRI followed by chemical analysis to decrease the need for re-operations.

Dr. Mirza says in the past, during spine surgeries, if he became concerned about whether screws or implants were perfectly placed, he would close up an incision and wheel his patient two floors down for a scan. In some cases, he would bring the patient back to revise the surgery, or in other cases accept “slightly imperfect” results to avoid more cutting. Revisions, in addition to adding to the patient’s risks, use up costly operating room and staff time, he says.

Last fall, Jack Deliso, then 8, needed surgery to remove a painful mass wrapped around his lower spine that made it increasingly hard for him to walk. An initial biopsy to test for malignancy had been inconclusive. Dr. Mirza and a pediatric neurosurgeon, David Bauer, proposed cutting out the entire tumor in one procedure.

Jack’s parents, Michael and Lisa Deliso, were fearful that if nerves were damaged during surgery, his ability to walk as well as his bladder and bowel function could be impaired.

The technology was reassuring. “They explained to us that they were able to take the pictures with the MRI while they were operating to make sure they got everything, without having to damage nerves or disturb the tumor,” Mr. Deliso says.

Jack says he was calm going into surgery “because it just had to be done and there was no use being scared of it.” He was tired of lying awake at night, when he says he felt “excruciating pain.”

During the 12-hour procedure, surgeons could see only the back of Jack’s spine. Because they didn’t know if the tumor was malignant, they were determined to avoid cutting into it, which could spread potentially cancerous cells elsewhere in the body. As they drilled into bones to detach and remove the tumor, they used a CT scan of the spine to help navigate accurately and avoid removing bone that wasn’t directly involved.

Next, they performed an MRI to make sure the nerve roots were unscathed and they hadn’t missed any part of the mass. Toward the end of the procedure, they did a second CT scan, which showed there was enough bone left so Jack wouldn’t need reconstruction with rods, screws and bone grafts. They finished up and closed the incision.

Jack was in the hospital for three nights. A week later, pathology tests came back showing the tumor had been benign and the surgeons had gotten all of it. Now 9 years old, Jack says he would like to play soccer or football—and be an orthopedic surgeon when he grows up.

Intraoperative scanning is costly for hospitals. For example, Imris Inc. of Canada makes Visius Surgical Theatre systems found in 87 operating rooms world-wide including at Brigham and Women’s and at Dartmouth. Each system consists of a two- or three-room suite with MRI units costing from about $3 million to $7 million, and CT scanners ranging from about $1.5 million to $3.5 million.

Jay Miller, president and chief executive, says over 17,000 procedures have been performed to date with Imris systems.

Intraoperative imaging has its own risks, says Bernadette Henrichs, director of the nurse anesthesia program at Barnes-Jewish College and nurse anesthesia research and education at Washington University School of Medicine, both in St. Louis.

Because of the strong magnetic force used in MRI, ferrous metal objects and tools must be kept out of the operating room, along with pagers, cellphones, jewelry and hair pins. Anesthesia teams stay with patients during scans and use equipment such as aluminum oxygen tanks and instruments made from plastic, titanium and other materials compatible with MRI.

At Barnes-Jewish Hospital, OR teams get training before they can work with live MRI imaging. They do annual safety drills including emergency procedures in the event a patient has a cardiac arrest while undergoing a scan.

“These are exciting advances, but we have to be vigilant in making sure patients and health-care workers aren’t harmed and take necessary safety precautions,” Ms. Hendrichs says.",1
"It’s hard to talk about carbs without talking about wheat, and it’s hard to talk about wheat without talking about gluten. Gluten is not a carbohydrate; it’s a mix of proteins found in wheat and its close relatives (including spelt, kamut and farro), as well as in barley and rye. It’s what gives bread its elasticity, but it also sets off the immune system of people with celiac disease, damaging the small intestine and sometimes producing painful and unpleasant symptoms.

Even some people who don’t have celiac disease feel better when they don’t eat wheat. They may assume that they have gluten sensitivity, but some researchers believe that it’s not the gluten they’re sensitive to. Instead, it’s fermentable oligosaccharides, disaccharides, monosaccharides and polyols, or FODMAPS.

Never was a group of molecules more desperately in need of an acronym. FODMAPs are a group of carbohydrates that don’t get broken down and absorbed in the small intestine. Instead, they pass through to the large intestine, where they draw water into the gut and start to ferment. The process by which FODMAPs are broken down and fermented can cause gastrointestinal distress: diarrhea, bloating, pain, flatulence and constipation. Wheat and rye are high in FODMAPs, as are onions, garlic, apples, stone fruit, pistachios and many other foods.

Research by Peter Gibson, a professor of gastroenterology at Australia’s Monash University, has found that some people who believed they were gluten-sensitive were, instead, FODMAP-sensitive. A low-FODMAP diet eased their symptoms, as it does for about 70 percent of people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome, a condition that causes abdominal pain and bowel changes. Gibson estimates that, overall, about 10 percent of the population may be FODMAP-sensitive.

But there’s a problem with a low-FODMAP diet. The fermentation that is painful to that 10 percent is good for your gut because it stimulates growth of the kind of bacteria associated with digestive health. “Following strictly the low-FODMAP diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health,” says Gibson, who stresses that a low-FODMAP diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms, not as a way to improve health.

If your gut can handle FODMAPs, foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices — partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way FODMAPs are digested means you’re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a FODMAP-rich product’s label. Unless you have specific symptoms that a low-FODMAP diet alleviates, Gibson says, “enjoy your FODMAPs!”

"An ancient herbal remedy is getting fresh attention this cold and flu season.

Some parents and even pediatricians believe elderberry extract or syrup can help kids stay healthy and lessen the symptoms when they do get sick.

The Brennan family in Glen Rock, New Jersey, believes it works..

""So we give the kids, and we take it ourselves, elderberry every morning right after breakfast,"" Kevin Brennan told CBS News.

He whips up a homemade concoction using frozen elderberries, blueberries and honey.

Some medical research suggests elderberry may reduce swelling in the mucous membranes to help relieve congestion. The Brennans' pediatrician, Dr. Lawrence Rosen, explains, ""Elderberry contains chemicals which are flavonoids which are anti-inflammatory agents.""

Raw elderberry is poisonous. istockphoto

One small study found an elderberry extract called Sambucol could shorten the duration of flu symptoms after a person gets sick by about 3 days. That would be similar to prescription antiviral medications like Tamiflu or Relenza, which have been proven effective in much larger studies and approved by the FDA to shorten the duration of the flu.

""There is not enough research about whether [elderberry] works in children and there is also isn't enough information about the proper dose in children,"" Dr. Anna Minta of Johns Hopkins Children's Center told CBS News.

Before you start popping elderberries, beware: eating them raw can make you sick.

The University of Maryland Medical Center says European elder, also called black elder, is the variety most often used for medicinal purposes. Raw or unripe elderberries, as well as other parts of the plant, contain a toxic compound related to cyanide. If the berries are not cooked thoroughly they can be poisonous.

But Kevin Brennan says, for his family, the natural alternative seems to be working. ""The duration and the severity of how they get sick is much less and they get healthy quicker,"" he said.",1
"(Reuters) - Achillion Pharmaceuticals Inc’s experimental hepatitis C drug, when used with Gilead Sciences Inc’s Sovaldi, eradicated signs of the virus in six weeks, the shortest duration and highest response achieved by any two-drug treatment.

Achillion’s shares rose as much as 19 percent to $12.85 on Monday on investor’s hopes that an all-Achillion combination could be as effective as Gilead’s and AbbVie Inc’s current therapies.

The estimated $20 billion market for hepatitis C drugs has developed at a lightning pace in recent years, with several companies including Gilead, AbbVie and Merck & Co Inc working on faster, more potent ways to cure the liver-destroying virus, which affects more than 170 million globally.

The new-generation hepatitis C regimens use a two- to three-drug combination – a nucleotide analog inhibitor or “nuke” and a NS5A inhibitor in Gilead’s case – to achieves a cure in about eight to 12 weeks, making them faster and more effective than older treatment options.

Gilead’s regimen Harvoni, with its own NS5A inhibitor and Sovaldi as the “nuke”, needs to be taken for at least eight weeks. Launched in October, its sales touched $2.11 billion in the quarter ended Dec. 31.

AbbVie’s three-drug cocktail Viekira Pak, which won U.S. approval in December, must be taken for at least 12 weeks.

Achillion’s ongoing mid-stage study tests its NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, with Sovaldi in previously untreated genotype 1 hepatitis C patients over six and eight weeks of therapy.

The main goal is to achieve a cure, or sustained virological response, 12 weeks after the completion of therapy.

Monday’s data shows Achillion’s NS5A inhibitor, ACH-3102, looks best-in-class, which could make up for its nuke, ACH-3422, being perhaps less effective than Sovaldi, analysts said.

The question then becomes whether ACH-3422 plus ACH-3102 - a weaker nuke and a stronger NS5A inhibitor - could be a good enough doublet as Harvoni, William Blair’s Katherine Xu said.

Achillion, one of the few companies developing hepatitis C therapies independently, plans to begin a mid-stage study this year to evaluate its proprietary doublet.

The all-Achillion regimen could hit the U.S. market by 2020 in a conservative scenario, Deutsche Bank’s Alethia Young estimated. She expects the treatment to cost about $35,000 per patient per year, assuming a 55 percent discount.

Harvoni’s list price is $93,400 and Viekira Pak is estimated to cost $83,319.",1
"Two highly effective contraceptives—the intrauterine device (IUD) and the implant—actually last much longer than they are currently recommended, according to new research.

In a new study published in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers discovered that the hormonal IUD and the implant are highly effective a year after they are currently approved for use.

MORE: The IUD Answer: Why The Best Form of Birth Control is the One No One Uses

The researchers followed 237 women who were using an implant like Implanon and Nexplanon and 263 women using the Mirena hormonal IUD. The implants are currently approved for three years, and the hormonal IUD used in the study is approved for five. (There is also a non-hormonal IUD that is approved for 12 years, but it was not included in the current study.)

All the women were between the ages of 18 and 45 and their contraceptives were within six months of expiring before they enrolled in the study. The women were informed of the pregnancy risk associated with using their device longer than recommended, and the researchers called them for followup every 6 months for 36 months or until the women had their device removed.

By the end of the trial period, none of the women using the implant were pregnant and there was one pregnancy among the women using the IUD. Still, the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the IUD when used during the five-year period (which is under 1%). The study is still ongoing, and the researchers plan to recruit up to 800 women and ultimately test whether the IUDs and implants were effective for up to three years after their current FDA-approved duration.

The benefit of being able to use the implant and IUD for a longer period of time is that it could reduce costs for individuals and insurance. The longer use also makes the IUD and implant more convenient for women, since maintenance is reduced.

Though the data is preliminary, the researchers say they believe that the hormonal IUD and the implant can both be used for an additional year longer than the FDA recommends. That doesn’t mean you should extend your own use of the contraceptives without talking to your doctor. The study is still continuing, and it could be quite a long time before any changes to clinical recommendations are considered.

"As a young girl, Rachel Brathen lived with crippling back pain. Born with scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, she was later in a car accident, then a white-water rafting accident that made her back problems worse.

“I had so much pain that I would wake up and reach my arm out to touch my alarm … and something would just snap,” the 26-year-old who now lives in Aruba said.

When she was a teen, doctors recommended surgery to straighten her spine. Both her aunt and grandmother also were diagnosed with scoliosis. Her aunt opted for the back surgery, which helped alleviate pain but also left her with very limited movement in her spine.

Then, a friend suggested Brathen try yoga. She decided to try a few classes before undergoing the knife.

More than 22 million people practice yoga in the United States, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. Many of them practice to improve flexibility and find pain relief, according to the Yoga Journal.

But as Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor, noted, it’s difficult to pin down whether yoga is effective at easing symptoms of those who have back pain.

“There are many types of yoga and so many different causes of back pain,” he said.

Despite the lack of conclusive research, Besser said, there is some recent evidence to suggest that people with chronic low-back pain who do a carefully adapted set of yoga poses may experience less pain and improve their ability to walk and move.

Ben Kane

In one randomized controlled trial published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, back pain patients who learned yoga had better back function and were better able to manage their pain. Another study in the same journal showed that yoga improved disability from chronic back pain more than exercise or self-care instructions.

There is also a close relationship between yoga and stress, so taking yoga might reduce stress and, in turn, provide some relief to someone with a tense, achy back, noted Dr. Amit Sood, professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota.

But as good as yoga may be for soothing stress and a sore back, Sood recommended getting medical clearance first and taking it slow and easy to start.

That’s exactly what Brathen did.

She started with gentle, restorative classes that focused on improving the core strength of her middle muscles. Little by little she noticed the pain was less intense and less frequent. She said it took years to move from a slow, meditative practice to more rigorous poses.

Today, she is not only nearly pain free, she is able to do advanced moves like handstands and acrobatic arm balances.

Brathen said she is so grateful for her yoga practice, she became an instructor. Now she travels the world teaching yoga and sharing her story. She started a social media challenge with the hashtag #yogaeverydamnday that has 1.6 million fans on Instagram.

But she said yoga has done more for her than just heal her lower back.

“Yoga helps with a feeling of well-being on so many levels,” she said. “The world could benefit more from people with flexible hearts than flexible bodies.”

Rachel George was used to being sick. A genetic condition left her with intellectual disabilities and a weak immune system. By 26, she had endured dozens of bacterial infections — kidney, ear, sinus, heart, bone, and more — and taken hundreds of antibiotic pills. But when she entered the Harborview Hospital in Seattle for a foot operation, her body’s defenses were pushed to a new limit. Hospitals are hotbeds for nasty — and sometimes deadly — infections. After her surgery, Rachel’s lungs picked up two: methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Both bugs are part of a growing category of bacterial infections that don’t respond to traditional antibiotics. Rachel was supposed to be in the hospital for five days. She stayed nine weeks. She developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome, and was put on a ventilator with a tube down her throat. When her doctors finally released her, they told her mother she had three years to live, at most, before the bugs won. Three years later, in January 2010, Rachel was indeed close to death. She was spending half of every month in intensive care, the other half at home, an IV constantly dripping into her bloodstream. By then she had cycled through more than a dozen powerful antibiotics. Each time the doctors would give her a new drug, then watch helplessly as the bacteria overpowered it. “Every time we took her back to the hospital, it was a question of whether or not this was going to be it,” her mother, Rose George, told BuzzFeed News. One day the nurse on duty asked Rose if she’d ever considered phage therapy. Rose had never heard of it, and that’s unsurprising: The therapy, which uses specialized viruses (called bacteriophages) to kill bacteria, is only available in a handful of former Soviet countries. Rose asked her daughter’s doctor, but she’d never heard of phage either. Soon Rose was on the phone with doctors at a small clinic in Tbilisi, in the Republic of Georgia, ordering 100 glass vials of viruses at $8 a pop. She’s one of at least 300 people desperate enough to try this little-known viral therapy from Eastern Europe. It’s an extreme solution to what may be this century’s biggest medical crisis: the death of antibiotics.

Since the discovery of penicillin in 1928, scientists have amassed a medical arsenal of more than 130 antibiotics. The drugs have prevented soldiers from losing limbs, and mothers from dying during childbirth. With access to antibiotics, parents no longer worry about losing their kid to an ear infection or bad scrape. But now antibiotics are everywhere — not just in orange pill bottles, but in the food given to pigs, cattle, and chicken. And the more the bugs interact with antibiotics, the quicker they evolve defense mechanisms. At least 18 strains of bacteria have evolved into “superbugs,” becoming resistant to most of our drugs. And pharmaceutical companies, more interested in profitable blockbusters like Viagra and Zoloft, haven’t developed a new class of antibiotics in 25 years. We’re dying because of it. More than 23,000 people in the U.S. die each year from antibiotic-resistant infections. By 2050, an estimated 10 million people worldwide will die by superbug. After two decades of warnings from the scientific community, the problem is finally getting serious attention. In his 2016 budget proposal released today, U.S. President Obama threw $1.2 billion at tackling the antibiotic-resistance crisis — nearly double the amount allocated last year. If approved by Congress, this money will go toward screening soil samples for new antibiotics, reducing the drugs in livestock feed, boosting hospital surveillance, and, perhaps, making phage therapy a viable option in the U.S. Phages are bacteria’s natural enemies. They work by injecting their DNA inside bacterial cells, where they replicate wildly, produce new phages, and eventually cause the bacteria to rupture — releasing even more viruses to hunt for bacterial prey. Phages’ power comes from two places: They are the most common and diverse organisms on Earth, and each phage harms only specific strains of bacteria. When you turn on the faucet, millions of phages flow out with your tap water. That leaves a nearly inexhaustible supply of potential agents to use in the fight against infection. Doctors have been using phages to kill bacteria for nearly a century — just not in the U.S. In 1923, a Georgian doctor named George Eliava set up the first phage therapy clinic, the Eliava Institute, in Tbilisi. Antibiotics hadn’t been discovered yet, so phages were a revolutionary weapon against all kinds of infections, Ryland Young, head of the Center for Phage Technology at Texas A&M University, told BuzzFeed News. “It was kind of pre-scientific — no one knew what these phages were except that they worked.” Five years later, penicillin came along. Effective, cheap, and quick to produce in large quantities, doctors in the U.S., U.K., and France quickly seized upon the “miracle drug” as a key to winning World War II. That also meant keeping this weapon away from the Soviets. With no access to antibiotics, scientists behind the Iron Curtain bolstered their use of phages instead. “At its very peak, when they were supplying the Russian army, the Eliava Institute was producing two to three tons of phages per day,” Zamphira Alavidze, a microbiologist in Tbilisi who worked at the Eliava Institute for 45 years, told BuzzFeed News. But after the fall of the Soviet Union, Eliava’s phage production dropped significantly, and it downsized into a small research center. Today Georgian doctors frequently use antibiotics to treat infections, but often in combination with phages. “Every clinic, everywhere in Georgia, everybody uses the phages,” Alavidze said. The last decade, she added, has brought another big change: Two small phage clinics in Tbilisi have sprung up to cater specifically to the boom of international patients like Rachel. “Ten or fifteen years ago, nobody believed the phages would be so popular. They thought we were crazy,” Alavidze said. “Now, it’s not too easy to come to Georgia, but we try to help somehow because sometimes nothing else works.”

Randy Wolcott, a wound care doctor in Lubbock, Texas, first went to Tbilisi in 2007. He was fed up with the lack of options for his patients with drug-resistant infections, and wanted to investigate phages as a treatment of last resort. Wolcott spent a week at the Eliava Institute. It looked nothing like the gleaming and sterile high-rises of most U.S. hospitals — the building was small, some of the equipment looked ancient, and the walls were unpainted. But after observing the Georgian clinicians at work, Wolcott was sold. He walked into a city pharmacy and bought hundreds of vials of phages concocted for wound infections. “They were very cheap, and I bought them by the case,” Wolcott told BuzzFeed News. The only hiccup came when explaining his viral cargo to U.S. customs officials. “It can cause some problems when our government hears that you’re bringing viruses back from a former Soviet country,” Wolcott said, chuckling. “It’s hard to explain. It’s a virus, but it’s a virus only for bacteria, not for us.” Phages aren’t approved for use in the U.S. So, once back in Lubbock, Wolcott wrote to the Texas Board of Medicine and asked for permission to use the viruses on his wound patients. The board decided that, because these patients had exhausted all other options, Wolcott would be allowed to use the experimental treatment in a legal arrangement known as “compassionate use.” Wolcott’s patients saw improvement within days. In 11 of the cases, the patients’ wounds healed enough to save their limbs. He treated hundreds of patients using the original batch of phages he brought over from Tbilisi. Five years ago, he went back for more. Wolcott usually uses the phages in combination with traditional antibiotics. But he says he couldn’t have offered the same quality of treatment without the viruses. “Someone needs to do this in America,” Wolcott said. “To have a bank of stuff that we can turn to for these chronic infections? That would be huge.”

Until that happens, though, patients are looking abroad. Rose George’s internet search led her to a clinic in Tbilisi called the Phage Therapy Center. It was set up in 2005 by Phage International, a fledgling medical tourism outfit founded in Danville, California, by a computer scientist named Chris Smith. The center’s doctors asked Rose to send over a bacterial sample from Rachel’s lungs. Over the course of a month, Rose attempted to send several samples, but each was rejected by U.S. customs. Rose’s son tried driving a sample across the border into Canada, which led to a seven-hour interrogation by Canadian agents, followed by two more hours with the FBI on the U.S. side. Finally, Smith suggested that Rose ambiguously label the package as “medical records.” She did, and the shipment slipped through. A few weeks later, the Georgian doctors called Rose with good news: They would be able to design a concoction of phages to treat Rachel’s infections. After convincing Rachel’s doctor to write a prescription for the viruses (so they could cross the U.S. border), Rose paid the Georgian clinic $800 for a three-month supply. She was surprised that phages were so inexpensive; in contrast, her insurance company was forking over roughly $14,000 a month for Rachel’s antibiotics. A couple of weeks later, 10 boxes filled with 100 vials of phages landed on the Georges’ doorstep. Rose used a nebulizer to administer the phages twice a day so that Rachel could breathe the liquids into her lungs. Within three weeks, Rachel’s MRSA — the same infection she’d been fighting with antibiotics for three years — disappeared. It hasn’t returned in the five years since.

Advocates of phage therapy see it as a powerful new weapon in the war we’re quickly losing against bacterial infection. But phages are certainly not a cure-all. Just ask Roger Mintey, a 65-year-old retired accountant from the sleepy English town of Reigate. In 1991, Mintey caught a severe sinus infection that left him with a near-constant cold. He’s had it, on and off, ever since. In the first decade of fighting his illness, Mintey sought help at five English hospitals, underwent two surgeries, and took more than two dozen courses of antibiotics. Nothing worked. In 2006, he heard about phage therapy from his cousin’s wife, who’d gone to Tbilisi to treat a chronic bladder infection. She pointed Roger to Phage International, the same company that helped Rose George get her daughter’s phages. The Georgian doctors affiliated with the company said they could treat his sinus infection, so Mintey cut Phage International a check for $5,000 and sent a sample of his nasal discharge to Georgia via FedEx. Then, accompanied by a friend, he boarded his first-ever plane to fly to the company’s Phage Therapy Center. They landed in Tbilisi at 3 a.m. and were met by someone from the clinic, who escorted them to their hotel. Mintey was instructed to drink a phage preparation three times a day from his hotel room. Every couple of days he would go into the clinic for additional phage treatments. The clinic was inside a nondescript building, set up something like an indoor mall. ""You went through a set of double doors, passed by a suntanning place, and there you were: one office, two treatment rooms, and that was it,” Mintey told BuzzFeed News. A doctor and two nurses had him sit on a cushioned patient’s chair. They tipped the chair back so his nostrils faced up, and poured the phage liquid into his nose. He was instructed to say the word “cuckoo” as the phages slowly slid into all of his sinuses, seeping out from his nasal passages into his forehead and cheekbones. His nose started bleeding, but the clinicians told him it was nothing to worry about. They also gave him a shot of manuka honey extract in his butt, telling him it had antimicrobial properties. “It was all quite uncomfortable,” Mintey said. After two weeks, Mintey flew back to England. Three days later, his infection was back. “I realized the entire treatment had done absolutely nothing,” he said. Mintey claims to have called, emailed, faxed, and sent physical letters to his doctors in Georgia and to Phage International’s headquarters in California. He heard nothing back. (Smith, of Phage International, claims that emails sent to Roger at the time were bouncing, and that he only had Mintey’s friend’s phone number.) Eventually, the clinic sent Mintey more phages in the mail, but the infection persisted. He says he has not heard from them since. “I was very disappointed,” Mintey said. “By the end of 2007, I had given up on phages.” Mintey’s situation highlights many of the difficulties surrounding a therapy only accessible through a small and largely unregulated medical tourism industry. Smith says Phage International has served more than 300 patients to date, with some 4,000 registered on its website. He wants to open a new phage therapy clinic in Trinidad, which could be easier for American patients to visit. “During the past 10 years, you’d go to an investor or venture capitalist, and they’d never heard of phage — and they didn’t want to know about it,” he said. “Now that’s changed.” Nothing about Phage International is decidedly illegal, I. Glenn Cohen, a law professor at Harvard’s Petrie-Flom Center for Health Law Policy, Biotechnology and Bioethics, told BuzzFeed News. But there are many ethical issues at play. What happens when something goes wrong? Or, as in Roger’s case, when a patient feels like he’s not getting what he paid for? “Who do you go after? Where do you do it?” Cohen said. “That’s where things get more tricky.”",1
"Leonard Guarente, one of the best-known antiaging researchers in the region, and the roster of eminent scientists have formed Elysium Health, which on Tuesday will debut its first product, a pill called Basis. They say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism.

A leading biologist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, with backing from five scientists who are Nobel prize recipients, is wading into the murky world of dietary supplements with a new antiaging pill that is said to restore muscle tissue, improve brain function, and increase energy levels by improving “metabolic health.”

Many products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science, but Elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound, called NAD, and improved health in older mice.

“There have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health. [We want to] make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick,” said Guarente, an Elysium Health founder and its chief scientific officer. “We are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation.”

The active ingredients in Basis are nicotinamide riboside, a substance that makes NAD and is found in traces in many foods such as milk, and pterostilbene, an antioxidant found in blueberries. Both substances are available individually as dietary supplements.

At a recommended dose of two gel caps daily, a month’s supply of Basis will cost $60 ($50 with a membership) and will be available online only. The company’s chief executive is Eric Marcotulli, previously a partner at the Silicon Valley venture firm Sequoia Capital.

Among the scientific heavyweights advising Elysium Health are Martin Karplus, emeritus professor of chemistry at Harvard and a 2013 Nobel Laureate; Tom Sudhof, a Stanford School of Medicine professor who received a Nobel in 2013; Eric Kandel, a biochemist and biophysicist at Columbia University and a 2000 Nobel Laureate; Aaron Ciechanover, distinguished research professor at Technion-Israel Institute of Technology and a 2004 Nobel recipient; and Jack Szostak, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School who received a Nobel in 2009.

Szostak said his role at Elysium Health is to scour scientific literature for new natural compounds that are shown to improve health and bring them to the company’s attention as potential ingredients in new products.

“What interests me in this is that it is a different challenge, to apply what we are learning through basic research, not just to curing disease but to keeping people healthy,” said Szostak, who runs a research lab at Massachusetts General Hospital. “If you go to Whole Foods or CVS, you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins. Most of them have no scientific basis, and you don’t know what you are getting.”

Guarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out. He was a founder of Elixir Pharmaceuticals and then became involved with Sirtris Pharmaceuticals, which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine.

With Elysium, Guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation. At $25 billion annually and growing, vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers. But the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny.

If Elysium Health were developing Basis as a drug, it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works, and the Food and Drug Administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine.

But as a supplement, Basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take, with labels that are not misleading. With Basis, for example, there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice.

Indeed, one scientist not involved with Elysium questions the company’s marketing pitch, saying there is too little information to know what Basis can do.

“It is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill,” said Pere Puigserver, a biology professor at Harvard Medical School. “What does it mean, to improve metabolic health? And what exactly is being repaired in the body? And is the outcome the same for everyone?”

Puigserver, who runs a cancer biology lab at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, noted that addressing health and aging through metabolism involves a complex web of pathways and mechanisms.

“We need more information on how this works precisely in people before we can advise them to take anything,” he said.

Guarente pledged that Elysium Health would be unlike most other companies in the business: It is conducting studies of its pill in humans and will release the results.

“As soon as we have analyzed the data, we will publish them on our website,” he said.

One of the venture capitalists backing Elysium Health acknowledged that skepticism is among the company’s greater challenges.

“This space is traditionally driven by marketing language,” said Kal Vapuri, whose New York firm Trisiras Group is one of Elysium’s initial funders. “But we will be data-driven and will communicate the complexities of science in simple ways.”

"(Reuters Health) – - Adding spice – in the form of curcumin supplements – to the daily diets of people with risk factors for heart disease may lower inflammation, a new study suggests.

Inflammation is implicated in a wide range of illnesses, from heart disease to cancer and joint pain. In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers.

“Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,” said the study’s senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar.

“Two key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,” said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email.

These properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease.

Having a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both.

Inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar’s team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study.

Half were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks.

At the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk.

They found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers.

The study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients.

“The findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,” Sahebkar said.

The researchers didn’t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it’s not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report.

The study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements.

Sahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician.

“Curcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,” Sahebkar said.

However, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said.

“In addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,” Sahebkar said.

Sahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements.

“Whilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,” he said.

Sahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.

"THE QUESTION Memory wanes as mild cognitive impairment or Alzheimer’s disease sets in. Might insulin, a drug used for diabetes, help?

THIS STUDY randomly assigned 60 adults with mild cognitive impairment or mild to moderate Alzheimer’s disease to be given, via nasal spray, 20- or 40-milligram doses of insulin detemir (Levemir), a man-made insulin that is longer acting than natural insulin, or a placebo daily for three weeks.

Standardized tests given at the start and end of the study showed that working memory, sometimes thought of as short-term memory, improved for those given 40 milligrams of insulin but not for those given the smaller dose or the placebo.

Also, among those in the 40-milligram group, people carrying what is sometimes called the Alzheimer’s gene (APOE-e4) showed more improvement than non-carriers.

WHO MAY BE AFFECTED ? People in the early stages of dementia. Some research has suggested a link between lower levels of insulin in cerebrospinal fluid and the formation of plaques often found in the brain tissue of people with Alzheimer’s.

Memory loss is often the first sign of dementia, which in later stages can interfere with such things as the ability to solve problems, control emotions or do such daily tasks as eating and dressing.

CAVEATS The study involved a relatively small number of participants and lasted a short time; a larger and longer study would be needed to adequately test effectiveness and safety.

"Take a deep breath and relax.

Behind that common piece of advice is a complex series of physiological processes that calm the body, slow the heart and help control pain.

Breathing and controlling your breath is one of the easiest ways to improve mental and physical health, doctors and psychologists say. Slow, deep and consistent breathing has been shown to have benefits in treating conditions ranging from migraines and irritable bowel syndrome to anxiety disorders and pain.

“If you train yourself to breathe a little bit slower it can have long-term health benefits,” said Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C. Deep breathing activates a relaxation response, he said, “potentially decreasing inflammation, improving heart health, boosting your immune system and maybe even improving longevity,”

To help foster the habit of healthful breathing, a San Francisco technology startup recently launched a wearable device called Spire that tracks breathing patterns and tells users when they are too tense or anxious. “One of the goals of this work was, ‘How do you make it so simple to shift into calm or focus that people don’t have to stop what they’re doing?’” said Neema Moraveji, co-founder of Spire and director of the Calming Technology Lab at Stanford University.

Many early buyers of the $150 Spire are office workers who spend a lot of time on computers. Research has found people working on computers often hold their breath, an action referred to as screen apnea, he said.

Belisa Vranich, a New York City-based clinical psychologist, has been conducting breathing workshops around the country for just over a year. Among her biggest clients: corporate managers eager to learn how to better manage stress.

Dr. Vranich says she instructs clients to breathe with their abdomen. On the inhale, this encourages the diaphragm to flatten out and the ribs to flare out. Most of us by instinct breathe vertically, using our chest, shoulders and neck, she says.

Abdominal, or diaphragmatic, breathing is often taught in yoga and meditation classes. Experts say air should be breathed in through the nose, and the exhale should be longer than the inhale. Dr. Vranich recommends trying to breathe this way all the time but other experts say it is enough to use the technique during stressful or tense times or when it is necessary to focus or concentrate.

Slow breathing stimulates the vagus nerve, which runs from the stem of the brain to the abdomen. It is part of the parasympathetic nervous system, which is responsible for the body’s “rest and digest” activities. (By contrast, the sympathetic nervous system regulates many of our “fight or flight” responses.)

The vagus-nerve activity causes the heart rate to decrease as we exhale, said Richard Gevirtz, a psychology professor at Alliant International University in San Diego. Vagal activity can be activated when breathing at about five to seven breaths a minute, said Dr. Gevirtz, compared with average breathing rates of about 12 to 18 breaths a minute.

The vagus nerve’s response includes the release of different chemicals, including acetylcholine, a neurotransmitter that acts as an anti-inflammatory and slows down digestion and the heart rate, said Stephen Silberstein, director of the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia who is working on an article on the vagus nerve and its functions.

When medical conditions are severe, such as with epilepsy, medical devices are sometimes implanted to stimulate the vagus nerve. For most people, slow, steady breathing is a natural way to stimulate the nerve.

Certain conditions, including asthma and panic disorders, have been shown to benefit from a different breathing technique—taking shallow breaths through the nose at a regular rhythmic speed of eight to 13 breaths a minute. For these patients, already anxious about their symptoms, deep breathing can cause them to take in too much air and hyperventilate.

Heart-rate-variability biofeedback uses breathing to train people to increase the variation in their heart rate, or the interval between heartbeats. The technique has been shown to have benefits for conditions including anxiety disorders and asthma. Biofeedback also makes breathing more efficient, said Paul Lehrer, a clinical psychologist at Robert Wood Johnson Medical School, part of Rutgers University in New Jersey. On average most people reach this balance when breathing 11 seconds per breath.

Spire, the device that tracks individual breathing patterns, is a pedometer-like device that can be clipped onto pants or a bra strap and can sense breathing patterns without touching the skin. A sensor detects subtle torso expansions and contractions, said Stanford’s Dr. Moraveji. The device identifies people’s baseline breathing patterns and can tell users when they are tense or may need to take a deep breath. It includes an app that guides people in breathing exercises as short as 30 seconds.

Dr. Moraveji’s research includes a 2011 Stanford study of 13 students that found subjects on average took 16.7 breaths a minute when they were doing normal computer work compared with 9.3 breaths a minute when they were relaxed, he said. The study was published in the proceedings of the annual ACM Symposium on User Interface Software and Technology.

A follow-up study involving 14 subjects found that giving feedback of breathing patterns on a computer screen allowed the subjects to control their breathing without decreasing their performance on an analytical task, Dr. Moraveji said. “We proved that because the breath is so easily controllable, you don’t have to interrupt your task in order to regulate your nervous system,” he said. The study was presented at the ACM CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems in 2012.

Dr. Vranich, the breathing coach, believes teaching people to unlearn dysfunctional breathing habits requires practice and exercises. Her group classes cost $150 for a three-hour workshop and private classes range from $350 to $450.

On a recent afternoon, she held a private session in her Manhattan studio with Joe March, a 40-year-old New York City firefighter who said he wanted to improve his lung capacity and condition for Brazilian jujitsu, a form of martial arts he practices.

Dr. Vranich positions many of her clients upside down, to better exercise the diaphragm muscles. She assisted Mr. March into a shoulder stand against a wall as she monitored his breathing. “Inhale, relax, and see if you can expand right by your diaphragm,” she said. “Exhale, squeeze your ribs at the same time.”

Earl Winthrop, a 60-year-old partner of a Boston wealth-management firm, is another of Dr. Vranich’s clients. “When I was working on the computer, I wasn’t breathing properly,” said Mr. Winthrop, who now does tailored breathing exercises and short bouts of meditative breathing. “I’m much more aware now. I feel more focused. I can calm myself down,” he said.",1

"(CNN) Even after decades of battling one of the world's biggest killers, the treatment of cancer is still an inexact science.

Successful methods such as chemotherapy work by killing the cancer cells, but they also destroy healthy tissue.

Health practitioners have been searching for a magic bullet that goes straight to the source of the cancer -- and everything from monoclonal antibodies, which carry cancer drugs direct to cancer cells, to straight surgery to cut out tumors have been used with varying degrees of success.

In Belgium, engineer and nuclear physicist Yves Jongen is pioneering a new therapy that targets cancers with proton radiation; a therapy that offers precision and minimal side effects.

""I started to designing equipment (for) proton therapy of cancer -- that was a radically new idea,"" Jongen told CNN.

Encased in a two-metre thick concrete bunker that serves as a radiation shield, one of Jongen's cyclotron machines produces proton beams to treat cancer patients.

""In this space we accelerate the protons and we give them a higher and higher velocity until they reach two thirds of the speed of light -- that's 200,000 km per second and this acceleration takes place in the shape of a spiral,"" he said.

It does a lot less collateral damage to the patient - that's the great thing about proton therapy Yves Jongen

""That's needed if you want to be able to penetrate one foot into the body of a patient.""

Once the proton beam has been generated, it's piped into a treatment room where patients receive a powerful dose of targeted radiation that kills only those cancerous cells.

""It does a lot less collateral damage to the patient,"" Jongen said. ""That's the great thing about proton therapy.""

While proton therapy is a giant step forward, it's not yet the magic bullet that clinicians are looking for. So far, it is not effective against all types of cancer.

""There are a number of cancers which are not localized,"" he said. ""If you look at leukemia, which is cancer of the blood cells, there is nowhere to shoot -- it's all through the body.""

The other drawback is that the cyclotron is not cheap.

Each system -- and the bunker needed to house it -- doesn't leave much change from $125 million. Currently there are just 43 operational particle therapy facilities worldwide , with a total of 121 treatment rooms.

As the fame of the process has started to spread, some people have been taking desperate measures to get treatment. One British couple last year even sparked an international manhunt after they removed their son from hospital without doctors' permission to get to a proton center in Prague in the Czech Republic.

Proton treatment is limited on Britain's National Health Service. Just one center in the north of the country offers proton therapy for certain types of eye tumors. Other centers, however, are currently in development.

Yves Jongen

While the proton therapy market is expected to more than double by 2018, with an estimated 300 proton therapy rooms, Jongen's Brussels-based company IBA is working on a smaller and cheaper model they hope will make proton therapy more accessible.

""It would be much less expensive making it more possible for a hospital to afford it -- a smaller system can already treat a relatively large number of patients per year.""

At the moment, fewer than 1% of cancer patients are treated with proton therapy, but Jongen is hopeful that smaller and cheaper machines will be the game changer.

""I have a number of letters from parents of young kids saying if it had not been for this treatment we would have lost our kid,"" he said.

""That's something I really cherish. When I feel a bit depressed, for whatever reason, I go back to those letters and they are very exciting.""

THURSDAY, Jan. 22, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A therapy involving ""video feedback"" -- where parents watch videos of their interactions with their baby -- might help prevent infants at risk for autism from developing the disorder, a new study suggests.

The research involved 54 families of babies who were at increased risk for autism because they had an older sibling with the condition.

Some of the families were assigned to a therapy program in which a therapist used video feedback to help parents understand and respond to their infant's individual communication style.

The goal of the therapy -- delivered over five months while the infants were ages 7 to 10 months -- was to improve the infant's attention, communication, early language development, and social engagement.

Other families were assigned to a control group that received no therapy.

After five months, infants in the families in the video therapy group showed improvements in attention, engagement and social behavior, according to the study published Jan. 22 in The Lancet Psychiatry.

Using the therapy during the baby's first year of life may ""modify the emergence of autism-related behaviors and symptoms,"" lead author Jonathan Green, a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at the University of Manchester in England, said in a journal news release.

""Children with autism typically receive treatment beginning at 3 to 4 years old,"" he explained. ""But our findings suggest that targeting the earliest risk markers of autism -- such as lack of attention or reduced social interest or engagement -- during the first year of life may lessen the development of these symptoms later on.""

Two experts agreed that early intervention is key.

""Research has shown that subtle markers of autism are identifiable in the first year of life,"" explained Dr. Ron Marino, associate chair of pediatrics at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. ""Video feedback seems like a natural and potentially very potent extension of intervention when it can be most effective,"" he added.

Dr. Andrew Adesman is chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York, in New Hyde Park, N.Y. He was cautiously optimistic about the promise of the video feedback approach.

""Although it would be wonderful if a relatively simple, video-based intervention could reduce the recurrence risk of autism spectrum disorder in later offspring, further studies are needed to examine this very issue,"" he said. Those studies ""will need to include a larger, more diverse sample population and need to look at developmental outcomes over a much longer period of time.""

"Because of the widespread impact of high blood pressure, researchers are likely to investigate in some depth any simple dietary interventions that could potentially benefit the wider population.

According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high blood pressure is either the primary cause of or contributes to more than 1,000 deaths in the United States every day.

Researchers have concluded that one glass of beetroot juice a day is enough to significantly reduce blood pressure in people with high blood pressure . They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants.

Medical researchers have recently returned to this plant product to investigate its effect on blood pressure and explore opportunities to put it to use in modern medicine and the home management of conditions.

Beetroot has been used since the Middle Ages as a treatment for ailments, particularly those relating to the blood and digestion.

High blood pressure is a serious public health concern. It increases the risk of more dangerous health conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, and chronic heart failure. High blood pressure is also a major risk factor for kidney disease.

Share on Pinterest Beetroot juice has been investigated for the powerful effect of its nitrate content on blood pressure.

Beetroot contains high levels of dietary nitrate (NO3), which the body converts into biologically active nitrite (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). In the human body, NO relaxes and dilates blood vessels.

Other leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and cabbage, also have high levels of the compound. They take it up from the soil through their roots.

A meta-analysis of 16 trials was published in The Journal of Nutrition in 2013.

The researchers found that ""Inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure.""

One major trial was carried out at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in the United Kingdom and published in the journal Hypertension. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation.

They found the following results:

""This interesting study builds on previous research by this team and finds that a daily glass of beetroot juice can lower blood pressure in people with hypertension - even those whose high blood pressure was not controlled by drug treatment."" Dr. Shannon Amoils, British Heart Foundation, senior research advisor

For the trial, Prof. Amrita Ahluwalia of the vascular pharmacology department at QMUL and her colleagues recruited 64 people aged between 18 and 85 years.

Half of the participants were taking prescribed medication for high blood pressure but did not reach their target blood pressure, and the rest had been diagnosed with high blood pressure but were not yet taking medication for it.

The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group consumed a 250-milliliter (ml) glass of beetroot juice, and the other group had the same, except their beetroot juice was nitrate-free.

The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group.

All groups consumed the juice daily for 4 weeks. They were also monitored for 2 weeks before and after the study, bringing the total trial period to 8 weeks.

The trial was double-blind, which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement.

During the 4 weeks in which they were taking the juice, patients in the active supplement group, whose beetroot juice contained inorganic nitrate, experienced a reduction in blood pressure of 8/4 millimeters of mercury (mmHg).

The first figure is systolic pressure, generated when the heart is pumping, and the second figure is diastolic pressure, created when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The 8/4-mmHg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range.

In the 2 weeks after they stopped drinking the juice, their blood pressure returned to the higher levels noted at the start of the study.

This is the first study that shows evidence of dietary nitrate supplementation's long-lasting benefit in a group of patients with high blood pressure.

Share on Pinterest High blood pressure is a common health issue in the U.S., and beetroot juice acts as a natural aid.

The patients in the active supplement group also experienced a 20 percent or so improvement in blood vessel dilation capacity, and their artery stiffness reduced by around 10 percent.

Studies show that these changes are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease.

There were no changes in blood pressure, blood vessel function, or artery stiffness in the placebo group.

The authors note that the reduction achieved in the active supplement group is close to that achieved by medication. The average reduction in blood pressure caused by a single anti-hypertension drug is 9/5 mmHg.

The study concludes:

""These findings suggest a role for dietary nitrate as an affordable, readily-available, adjunctive treatment in the management of patients with hypertension.""

To put the importance of these findings in context: The authors note that large-scale observational studies show that for every 2 mmHg increase in blood pressure, the risk of death from heart disease goes up 7 percent and the risk of stroke by 10 percent.",1
"When Bariatric Surgery's Benefits Wane, This Procedure Can Help

Enlarge this image toggle caption ImageZoo/Corbis ImageZoo/Corbis

For most of her life Fran Friedman struggled with compulsive eating. At 59 years old she was 5 foot 2 and weighed 360 pounds. That's when she opted for bariatric surgery.

The surgery worked. Friedman, who is now 70 and lives in Los Angeles, lost 175 pounds. ""It was a miracle,"" Friedman says, not to feel hungry. ""It was the first time in my life that I've ever lost a lot of weight and was able to maintain it.""

Friedman kept the weight off for almost 10 years. But then to her dismay she started to gain it back. ""I thought I was cured,"" she says. ""I thought I could eat like regular people.""

She's not alone, says Dr. Rabindra Watson, Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Division of Digestive Diseases.

About one in three patients regain significant amounts of weight a few years after surgery to reduce the size of the stomach pouch. Bariatric surgery shrinks the stomach to about the size of an egg, so people feel full from eating very little food. The problem is that over the years the stomach stretches, and when that happens, Watson says, ""Patients are able to eat more at one sitting and they feel hungrier more often.""

At the same time, hormonal changes that reduce the appetite and take effect immediately after the surgery begin to decline. Watson says we don't know for sure, but it's possible the body begins to adapt to those changes, which is why the weight loss is reversed over time.

For Fran Friedman, it meant a 20-pound weight gain and a bout of depression. ""The reality hits,"" she says. ""Do I want to go back to where I was or do I want to maintain this level of quality of life?""

So Friedman opted for a less invasive procedure to make her stomach smaller again. It's called Transoral Outlet Reduction – or TORe for short. It's one of several procedures designed to help people maintain the benefits of bariatric surgery. This procedure involves inserting an endoscope through the mouth into the stomach while the patient is under anesthesia. It costs $8,000 to $13,000 and insurance coverage varies.

If the stomach pouch has stretched, new sutures are put in place to once again reduce the size of the stomach. After the surgery, Watson says, patients report feeling fuller and less hungry and they ultimately gain greater control over what they are eating. And research conducted over the past decade suggests it works. There are no significant side effects to the surgery, and patients can return to work the day after they have the procedure.

For Friedman, it did the trick. She has lost 30 pounds since her second surgery. And now, she says, with the help of a support group she is recommitted to watching what she eats and how much she exercises. She wants to lose another 20 pounds. And more importantly, she wants to keep the weight off.",1
"In a bid to increase treatments for the nation’s 79 million obese adults, the Food and Drug Administration has approved U.S. marketing of an implantable device that stimulates weight loss by manipulating key appetite signals passing between the brain and the gut.

The new device is the Maestro Rechargeable System, manufactured by EnteroMedics of St. Paul, Minn. While the FDA has approved four medications for weight loss in the past 2 1/2 years, the Maestro system is the first weight loss device to be approved since 2007.

Using electrical leads implanted just above the stomach and a regulator carried under the skin near the ribcage, the device suppresses signals carried by the vagus nerve.

The device adopts a variant of a “neuromodulation” technique long used in the treatment of epilepsy: by applying intermittent bursts of electrical current to the vagus nerve, it disrupts the signals that prompt the stomach to relax, expand and prepare for an influx of food.

“We think it will be a very important tool in the toolbag of surgeons and physicians treating obesity and its co-morbidities,” said Gregory S. Lea, senior vice president and chief financial officer of EnteroMedics. “When patients leave the diet, counseling and drug world and have nothing more, they turn to surgical procedures, and only 1% to 2% of patients who might be eligible for bariatric surgery are getting it.”

The FDA approved the use of the device in adult patients with a body mass index, or BMI, between 35 and 45, who have at least one other obesity-related condition, such as type 2 diabetes.

Delivered by the Maestro device, vagal blocking therapy, or VBLOC, offers obese patients a weight loss therapy that does not permanently alter the digestive system in the way that gastric bypass surgery does, and which may be less expensive, said Lea. He added it poses no risk of the “malabsorption” problems that often come with such surgery.

In a 12-month clinical trial considered by the FDA, 38.3% of subjects who received the active Maestro device lost at least a quarter of their excess weight, and 52.5% of subjects lost at least 20% of their excess weight. On average, weight loss in those subjects with an active device was about 8.5% greater than that seen in subjects who received a Maestro electrical pulse generator that was not activated.

The human body’s longest cranial nerve, the vagus--or “wandering""--nerve stretches from the lower abdomen up to the brain stem, passing through the heart, esophagus and lungs. A key node in the body’s involuntary nervous system, it carries signals between body and brain that control heart rate, digestive processes and respiration.

In a 60- to 90-minute laparoscopic procedure, physicians trained to implant the new device will attach its electrical leads to the anterior and posterior trunks of the vagus nerve, right at the gastric junction. During a patient’s waking hours, the device is designed to alternate between delivering five-minute bursts of high-frequency energy and five minutes of inactivity. During sleep, the device powers down.

By suppressing the exchange of messages that cue hunger and ready the stomach for food, the intermittent electrical currents make most feel less hungry, feel full sooner and to feel full for longer. Most eat less and lose weight.

Researchers testing the device also observed that, like bariatric surgery, it might have beneficial effects that go beyond weight loss. Suppressing signals between gut and brain on the vagus nerve appeared to improve the metabolic function of obese patients who got the device.

“You actually see the effect before patients actually have had that much weight loss,” said Dr. Ken Fujioka, a Scripps Institute endocrinologist and weight management expert who conducted some of the studies that led to the EnteroMedics device. That suggests that the device may be especially beneficial for those who have developed obesity-related type 2 diabetes, he said.

The on-again, off-again nature of the Maestro device’s stimulation serves another purpose: it prevents the vagus nerve’s gut signals from going silent--a communication loss that would likely prompt the central nervous system to find a compensatory workaround.

As a result, said Lea, the Maestro device appears to be safe and effective for long-term use, and unlike surgical alterations to the digestive system, reversible. Women who have had the device implanted and became pregnant were able to have it inactivated during their pregnancy, and then reactivated afterward, he said.

While the cost of the device has not yet been set, Lea said that getting the device implanted and activated will likely cost “somewhere between $20,000 and $30,000""--an amount that is more than gastric banding but less some of the most complex gastric bypass surgery.

The company has begun negotiations with private insurers, and the device has been been recognized as “exploratory” by the board that sets policy for Medicare reimbursements, and Lea expressed hope that some might agree to cover the procedure as early as later this year.

Can a cup of blueberries keep the doctor away? Maybe.

Researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study of 40 postmenopausal women ages 45 to 65 with high blood pressure. Half ate 22 grams of freeze-dried blueberry powder (equivalent to a cup of blueberries) daily for eight weeks. The others consumed an identical-looking and tasting placebo.

The study, in The Journal of the Academy of Nutrition and Dietetics, found that those who ate the blueberry preparation saw an average 5.1 percent decrease in systolic blood pressure (the top number) and a 6.3 percent decrease in diastolic pressure. Levels of nitric oxide, known to be involved in relaxing and widening blood vessels, increased significantly in the blueberry eaters. There were no significant changes in the placebo group.

The improvement, the scientists write, was moderate compared with that of blood pressure medicines. But, they say, eating blueberries in larger amounts or for longer periods could increase the effect.

The lead author, Sarah A. Johnson, a postdoctoral researcher at Florida State University, said she saw no reason for people to radically change their diet, but that if they are not eating blueberries, they might want to try them. “There is something very special about the composition of blueberries that is responsible for their effect on blood pressure,” she said. “Other fruits and plant extracts have not produced the same result.”",1
"The results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline (marketed as Chantix), a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain. But the patch costs less and has fewer side-effects than varenicline (including nausea, difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams), so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch.

AD

Normal metabolizers of nicotine, meanwhile, had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster, limiting the effectiveness of the patch. Varenicline contains no nicotine.

""The slower metabolizers, they do very well with the patch. And they get no incremental benefit from varenicline,"" Lerman said in an interview. ""Why spend the money? Why have the side-effects?""

This may seem like common sense, but no one had ever tested it before, she said. And given how difficult it is to kick the habit, smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try, Lerman said.

""Each time somebody fails, it affects their self confidence,"" Lerman said. ""The trial and error approach is not optimal.""

AD

Researchers did not test nicotine gum because it delivers a less consistent flow of nicotine to the user, she said. The patch, worn on the skin, delivers a steady flow of the drug, she said.

In some of the test groups, overall success rates were fairly low, Lerman noted, but the study was conducted during the Great Recession, a time when financial stress may have depressed the chances of succeeding for everyone, regardless of which approach was used.

"Karen Weintraub Special to USA TODAY

A new cancer drug, Opdivo, is working so well that pharmaceutical giant Bristol-Myers Squibb announced Monday it is stopping a trial in lung cancer two years ahead of schedule.

The trial compared Opdivo to Docetaxel, a type of chemo used for patients whose cancers have recurred after treatment. The study, in 234 patients, was the largest trial of the drug in lung cancer.

""We as a lung cancer community are incredibly excited about the activity of immunotherapy in various aspects of the disease,"" said Pasi Janne, director of the Lowe Center for Thoracic Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ""It's a disease where we're desperately looking for new therapies.""

Lung cancer kills more Americans than any other type of cancer, nearly 160,000 last year.

The new trial looked at a type of lung cancer called squamous cell non-small cell lung cancer, which accounts for about 20%-30% of lung cancers.

There have been no other recent treatment breakthroughs in squamous cancer, which most commonly occurs in smokers or former smokers, so this advance is particularly welcome, said Janne.

Janne, also a professor at Harvard Medical School, said more research is needed before lung cancer patients should be routinely treated with Opdivo, Keytruda or similar drugs.

""I think it's a little premature to start treating people today,"" he said, ""but I don't think we're far away from that.""

In December, the Food and Drug Administration approved Opdivo to treat advanced melanoma, a type of skin cancer that used to be considered a death sentence.

Opdivo and others in its class work by removing a brake that cancer puts on the immune system. In some patients, just removing the brake is enough to allow the person's immune system to fight and contain the cancer. For other patients, researchers expect other drugs will be needed, too.

In addition to melanoma and lung cancer, this brake-release approach has been shown effective in early trials against bladder, kidney, head and neck cancers, and some blood cancers.

""We are feeling more and more confident that we are on the cusp of a treatment revolution,"" said Roger Perlmutter, president of Merck Research Laboratories, which has its own, similar drug called Keytruda.

Merck is also studying Keytruda in people with advanced lung cancer to better understand how they are responding to treatment, what determines how well a patient will respond, and how to get good results for more patients, Perlmutter said.

Existing treatments – chemotherapy, radiation, surgery and so-called targeted therapies – can help beat back tumors, but once cancer has spread, it almost always returns. Immune therapy drugs offer the possibility that the immune system will keep cancer in check indefinitely.

But there are still a lot of unanswered questions about immune therapy.

""It is early days for the successes of immune therapy,"" said Mark Fishman, president of the Novartis Institutes for BioMedical Research, a research arm of drug company Novartis, which is taking a different approach to turning the immune system against cancer. ""We're looking right now through a small keyhole at a very very large room, and we really don't know yet how big it will be.""",1

MONDAY, Jan. 12, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- School readiness isn't the only benefit young children can gain from Head Start. A new study finds that kids in the U.S. preschool program tend to have a healthier weight by kindergarten than similarly aged kids not in the program.

In their first year in Head Start, obese and overweight kids lost weight faster than two comparison groups of children who weren't in the program, researchers found. Similarly, underweight kids bulked up faster.

""Participating in Head Start may be an effective and broad-reaching strategy for preventing and treating obesity in United States preschoolers,"" said lead researcher Dr. Julie Lumeng, an associate professor at the University of Michigan Center for Human Growth and Development.

Federally funded Head Start, which is free for 3- to 5-year-olds living in poverty, helps children prepare for kindergarten. The program is designed to build stable family relationships, improve children's physical and emotional well-being and develop strong learning skills.

Health benefits, including weight loss, seem to be a byproduct of the program, said Dr. David Katz, director of the Yale University Prevention Research Center.

""This paper importantly suggests that some of the best strategies for controlling weight and promoting health may have little directly to do with either,"" said Katz, who wasn't involved in the study.

Head Start might provide a structured, supervised routine that's lacking in the home, Katz suggested. ""Perhaps the program fosters better mental health in the children, which in turn leads to better eating,"" he said.

""Whatever the exact mechanisms, by fostering well-being in one way, we tend to foster it in others, even unintended,"" Katz said. ""The essence of this study is the holistic nature of social, psychological and physical health.""

Almost one-quarter of preschool-aged children in the United States are overweight or obese, and obesity rates within Head Start populations are higher than national estimates, the study authors noted. Because obesity in childhood tends to continue into adulthood, experts worry that these children are at risk of future health problems.

For the study, Lumeng's team collected data on more than 43,700 Michigan preschool-age children between 2005 and 2013. More than 19,000 were in Head Start. Information on the others -- 5,400 of whom were on Medicaid, the publicly financed insurance program for the poor -- came from two primary health care groups. Whether those children were in another preschool program wasn't stated.

At the study's start, about one-third of the Head Start kids were obese or overweight, compared to 27 percent of those on Medicaid and less than 20 percent of kids not on Medicaid.

""Even though children in the Head Start group began the observation period more obese, equally overweight, and moreunderweight than children in the comparison groups, at the end of the observation period the initially obese and overweight Head Start children were substantially less obese andoverweight than the children in the comparison groups,"" the authors wrote.

Lumeng said an emphasis on good nutrition and exercise may partly explain the perceived Head Start advantage.

""Head Start programs must adhere to specific dietary guidelines,"" she said. ""The children may be served healthier meals at Head Start than other children.""

In addition, Head Start requires a certain amount of active play each day, Lumeng said. ""Thus, children attending Head Start may be getting more opportunities for physical activity than other children,"" she explained.

The daily routine might translate into less TV time and more regular sleep schedules, she said. ""We know that better sleep is linked with less obesity,"" she added.

""It [also] may be that when kids go to Head Start, it reduces stress in the household and frees up time and resources at home to dedicate to healthier eating patterns,"" she noted.

The report was published Jan. 12 online in the journal Pediatrics.

"Just an avocado a day can significantly lower your cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease, a new study shows.

Avocados are rich in so-called healthy fats and other nutrients and the study, published in the Journal of the American Heart Association, shows the creamy fruit can work within weeks to lower cholesterol.



Just like olive oil and nuts, avocados have plaque-busting monounsaturated fatty acids, and the effects seem similar to all the benefits from a Mediterranean diet, the researchers said.

And it’s one more piece of evidence in favor of adding good fats to the diet.

Avocados can lower your cholesterol, a new study shows Today

“In the past, we used to substitute carbohydrate for saturated fat, and that would result in a low-fat diet,” said Penny Kris-Etherton, chair of the American Heart Association’s Nutrition Committee and distinguished professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University.

“Now we're seeing that it's better for people to have good fats in their diet at the expense of saturated fat. And so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat, and in so doing, consume a moderate-fat diet, not too much, and also not too little,” Kris-Etherton told NBC News.

Kris-Etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with 45 typical Americans – all overweight or obese, but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels.

It’s tough to test diets in real life, because people eat so many different things, but the team controlled what everyone ate, feeding them carefully calibrated diets. One was a lower-fat diet without avocado, another was a moderate-fat diet without avocado, and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate-fat diet.

Trending stories,celebrity news and all the best of TODAY. This site is protected by recaptcha Privacy Policy | Terms of Service

The two moderate-fat diets looked a lot like the average American diet, with about a third of calories coming from fat. The lower fat diet provided 24 percent of calories from fat.

Everyone spent five weeks on each diet. No one lost weight, but their low-density lipoprotein (LDL or “bad” cholesterol) levels changed.

“All diets decreased LDL cholesterol, the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease. But the diet with the avocado decreased LDL cholesterol the most,” Kris-Etherton said.

Americans are advised to keep total cholesterol below 200 and preferably below 180. LDL should be below 100.

While they were eating the avocado-a-day diet, the volunteers saw their LDL go down by more than 13 points compared to their usual levels, Kris-Etherton’s team reported in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

LDL was 8.3 points lower on the moderate-fat diet without the avocado and 7.4 points less on the lower-fat diet.

The volunteers all ate Hass avocados, which have bumpy green skin. The Hass Avocado Board helped pay for the research, which was also funded by the U.S. government.

In addition to monounsaturated fats, the avocados contain fiber, phytosterols and polyphenols – all of which can help lower cholesterol. Avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar.

“We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats,” Kris-Etherton said.

“All the foods were exactly the same, except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate-fat diet. So that was the only difference between the two diets, which then tells us that it's the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat.”

The findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier. They were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks, and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn’t get the extra oils.

Saturated fat – the kind found in meat and butter – has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products. Repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease.



“We studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol-lowering effects,” Kris-Etherton said. “And certainly there's an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably, like high-density lipoprotein. I think we need to stay tuned for that. “

Americans may not be used to eating avocado but Kris-Etherton says it’s easy to add.

“Consumers can include avocados in their diet in salads. They can include avocados on top of a sandwich, or in a sandwich. They can make guacamole and use vegetables rather than chips as the dip,” she said.

“I love guacamole and with my recipe, I'll use avocados, cilantro, lime juice and garlic... and then sometimes I'll put salsa in, or red pepper flakes.”

But like anything, too much of a good thing can be harmful. Avocados are definitely not low-calorie food.

“One avocado has around 200 to 250 calories. So I would strongly urge people not to just add an avocado a day to their diet but they have to substitute nutrient-poor calories, which are so popular in the U.S. diet.,” Kris-Etherton said.

"A new study claims that consuming one avocado a day as part of a moderate-fat diet could help lower bad cholesterol among people who are overweight or obese.

Share on Pinterest Consuming one avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet was found to lower 'bad' cholesterol among overweight and obese individuals.

The researchers, including senior author Penny M. Kris-Etherton, PhD, distinguished professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, publish their findings in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

It is well known that avocados are high in fat, but the majority of an avocado's fat is monounsaturated, which is deemed a ""good"" type of fat. It is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol, reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke.

For their study, Kris-Etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption - by replacing saturated fatty acids, or ""bad"" fats - affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases.

The team recruited 45 healthy participants aged 21-70 years who were either obese or overweight.

Every participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol-lowering diets for 5 weeks. The diets consisted of a lower-fat diet without avocado, a moderate-fat diet without avocado or a moderate-fat diet with one Hass avocado a day.

Prior to starting each diet, subjects ate what the researchers deem an ""average American diet,"" which was made up of 34% of calories from fat, 16% from protein, while around half of calories were from carbohydrates.

From both of the moderate-fat diets, participants gained 34% of calories from fat, of which 17% were from monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFAs). The lower-fat diet provided participants with 24% of calories from fat, of which 11% was from MUFAs.

Moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day lowered 'bad' cholesterol by 13.5 mg/dL

The researchers found that participants' levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL) - referred to as the ""bad"" cholesterol - were an average of 8.3 milligrams per deciliter (mg/dL) lower after following the lower-fat diet without an avocado and 7.4 mg/dL lower after following the moderate-fat diet without an avocado, compared with their baseline average.

However, after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, their LDL levels were found to be an average of 13.5 mg/dL lower than their baseline average.

What is more, the team found that a number of additional blood measurements - such as total cholesterol, small dense LDL, triglycerides and non-HDL (high-density lipoprotein) - were better after participants followed the moderate-fat diet with one avocado a day, compared with the other two diets.

Although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate-fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol, the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study. ""That is not the real-world,"" says Kris-Etherton, ""so it is a proof-of-concept investigation.""

Still, the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources. Kris-Etherton adds:

""We need to focus on getting people to eat a heart-healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient-rich food sources of better fats. In the United States avocados are not a mainstream food yet, and they can be expensive, especially at certain times of the year. Also, most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole. But guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips, which are high in calories and sodium. Avocados, however, can also be eaten with salads, vegetables, sandwiches, lean protein foods (like chicken or fish) or even whole.""

It should be noted that this research was supported by the Hass Avocado Board, but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study.

In January 2014, Medical News Today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management.

"Bite Back At Bad Cholesterol: Eat An Avocado A Day

Enlarge this image toggle caption Tastyart Ltd Rob White/Getty Images Tastyart Ltd Rob White/Getty Images

New research finds that eating an avocado per day, as part of an overall diet rich in healthy fats, may help cut the bad kind cholesterol, known as LDL.

Researchers at Pennsylvania State University recruited 45 overweight participants who agreed to try three different types of cholesterol-lowering diets. Their study was published Wednesday in the Journal of the American Heart Association.

One was a low-fat diet that included lots of fruits, low-fat dairy, poultry, whole grains and small amounts of red meat.

The other two diets were moderately high in fat, with about 34 percent of total calories consumed per day coming from fat. The types of foods and meals were similar to the low-fat diet, but included more nuts and oils.

One of the moderately high-fat diets included a daily serving of one avocado.

In one sample meal plan, lunch was chicken salad with half an avocado, and dinner included turkey tacos with another half an avocado.

The diets were similar in terms of macronutrients (like protein and fats) and calories. The only difference between the two was the avocado — the other diet had the same amount of fat from other sources.

At the end of the study, the researchers found that the avocado diet led to significant reductions in LDL cholesterol, compared with the other two diets.

To put the difference in perspective, the avocado diet decreased LDL cholesterol about 14 milligrams per deciliter of blood. Compare that with a decrease of about 7 mg/dL for the low-fat diet, and about a 8 mg/dl drop from the moderate-fat diet.

""I was surprised to see the added benefit [of the avocado],"" Penny Kris-Etherton, a nutrition scientist at Penn State and the lead author of the study, tells us."" It's something in the avocado"" other than just the fat composition, she says.

She says she'd like to do follow-up research to look at the bioactive compounds in avocados, which may explain the added reduction in LDL cholesterol in the study participants. It's also possible that the fiber in avocados plays a role in the cholesterol-lowering effect, she says.

But one caveat for anyone who loves guacamole: When it's served up with chips, the calories can add up. A mere half-cup of guacamole has about 200 calories all on its own.

Kris-Etherton's study was funded, in part, by the National Center for Research Resources, part of the National Institutes of Health.

It was also supported by a grant from the Hass Avocado Board, an industry group that the researchers say had no role in the design of the study or the interpretation of the data.

We asked Kris-Etherton if she would have published the results had there been no positive findings for the avocado.

""Oh, absolutely!"" she told us. The agreement was to publish no matter the results. And given the reduction in funds available for research, it's become increasingly common for researchers to carry out these kinds of industry-supported studies.",1
"Women who want to quit smoking may find it easier if they time their efforts just right. A new study finds hormone fluctuations that occur over the course of a woman's menstrual cycle may impact her ability to kick the cigarette habit.

According to small study conducted by researchers at the University of Montreal, women are more likely to crave cigarettes and have trouble quitting when in the follicular phase of their monthly cycle. This is the time right after her period and before ovulation.

""While overall more men than women smoke cigarettes, women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit,"" the researchers write in their study. ""One of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle.""

The study, which was published in Psychiatry Journal, involved 19 women and 15 men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy. None of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit.

Researchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette 30 to 40 minutes before undergoing an fMRI, or brain scan. They were asked to view photos both related and unrelated to smoking. After undergoing the brain scans they viewed the photos a second time and reported on a scale from zero to 100 if the pictures triggered cigarette cravings.

The researchers tested 13 of the female participants twice to assess how their response changed at a different point in their menstrual cycle.

The brain scans showed that during the follicular stage, cigarette imagery activated five areas of the brain which the researchers say are linked to higher-level cravings. However during the luteal phase -- after a woman ovulates and before her period -- only one area of the brain was activated by images of cigarettes and smoking.

During the luteal phase, estrogen and progesterone levels are at their highest, which may help a woman keep addictive cravings at bay and reduce feelings of cigarette withdrawal.

Previous studies have found women's monthly hormone fluctuations can affect everything from food cravings and digestive problems to joint pain and a whole host of other health issues.

""This result emphasizes the need for gender-specific programs to quit smoking, as well as taking into consideration a menstrual cycle phase during addiction treatment in women,"" the researchers conclude. They called for more studies to help understand all the factors that contribute to sex and gender differences in smoking.",1

Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness.

Active older people resemble much younger people physiologically, according to a new study of the effects of exercise on aging. The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us.

Aging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time — in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays — or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable.

This conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older.

In the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King’s College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach.

They removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit.

“We wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,” said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King’s College London.

To accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people.

The scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist’s endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again.

The researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test’s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age.

As it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people’s levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability.

And their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is “well within the norm reported for healthy young adults,” the study authors write.

Some aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise.

But even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above.

All in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active.

“If you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age” of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, “it would be impossible.” On paper, they all look young.

Of course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging.

But even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that “being physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person’s.”",1
"Better yet, the drug, fexaramine, works only in the intestine, never entering the bloodstream. That makes it much safer than, say, systemic stimulants that also rev up the heart and other parts of the body and cause strong side effects, according to the research. Anyone remember fen-phen?

For now, the new approach has been demonstrated only in mice, according to the research, published Monday in the journal Nature Medicine. But Ronald Evans, director of the institute's Gene Expression Laboratory and lead author of the new study, said in an interview that if it shows the same promise in primate studies, clinical trials on humans could begin in a couple of years.

""We described a new type of therapy that targets the known genetic switch in our bodies that is linked to eating and metabolic control,"" Evans said. ""The drug or the pill is taken orally, and it tricks the body into thinking you’ve eaten a meal."" Yet the mice showed no reduction in appetite and continued to eat the same amount of food, the study showed.

The paper suggests that the drug may one day offer a nonsurgical alternative to ""vertical sleeve gastrectomies"" that have become popular in the battle against morbid obesity. More than a third of the U.S. population is considered obese.

Nearly 20 years ago, Evans's lab worked to identify the molecular switch that turns on a whole series of bodily responses to eating, including digestion, absorption, the transfer of nutrients by the bloodstream and increased blood circulation, to name a few. In mice at least, fexaramine turns on that switch and sets off the same cascade of reactions without any side effects, Evans said. Other researchers are working on similar approaches, he said, but this drug, so far, passes harmlessly out of the intestine after doing its work.

""We can get that whole process of what a meal does without actually having the meal,"" he said.

The study also found other benefits. The drug contributed to development of brown fat, which helps burn calories, and relieves inflammation of cells in various tissues, which is the result of chronic obesity. It also reduced resistance to insulin, the hormone that helps cells absorb the glucose they use for energy. Many Type 2 diabetics become resistant to insulin and have to inject additional amounts.

But don't expect to be popping fexaramine any time soon. In the meantime, basic weight loss advice remains the same: fewer calories in, more calories expended by physical activity.

"(Reuters) - A new type of asthma drug meant to attack the underlying causes of the respiratory disease slashed episodes by 87 percent in a mid-stage trial, making it a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease, researchers said on Tuesday.

“Overall, these are the most exciting data we’ve seen in asthma in 20 years,” said Dr. Sally Wenzel, lead investigator for the 104-patient study of dupilumab, an injectable treatment being developed by Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc and French drugmaker Sanofi.

The drug also met all its secondary goals, such as improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists.

Although far larger trials will be needed to confirm findings from the “proof of concept” study, researchers expressed optimism. They noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis, or severe eczema, an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments.

Results of the 12-week asthma study are being presented on Tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the American Thoracic Society in Philadelphia.

The medicine, if approved, could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs.

“We have been treating asthma with sort of Band-Aid therapies that didn’t get at the underlying causes,” Wenzel said in an interview, adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem.

The drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation, interleukin-4 (IL-4) and interleukin-13 (IL-13).

HITS ELUSIVE TARGETS

Wenzel, director of the Asthma Institute at the University of Pittsburgh, said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins, but without success.

The trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils, a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type 2 helper T cells (Th2 cells) associated with allergy and asthma have been activated.

Such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment.

All patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments, meaning medium-to-high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids, as well as long-acting beta agonists. But patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after 9 weeks.

Throughout the Phase IIa trial, half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab, while half received placebo injections.

After the ninth week, 25 percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations, a catch-all term that included the need to take a beta agonist, a decrease in lung function, the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid, or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma.

“By end of the trial, after 12 weeks, 44 percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations, compared with 5 percent of those on dupilumab,” Wenzel said. That represented an 87 percent reduction in exacerbations, which was highly statistically significant.

Wenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated, with side effects similar to placebo. But she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug.

Regeneron and Sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in 10 to 20 percent of patients. They estimate that inflammation caused by Th2 cells - the type of inflammation among patients they tested - affects up to 2.5 million people in the United States and up to 30 million worldwide.

Dupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early-stage trials that involved 67 patients with atopic dermatitis. Larger studies are slated to begin later this year.

Atopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body. Patients, many of whom also have asthma and hay fever, have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy.

“This asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases,” George Yancopoulos, Regeneron’s research chief, said in an interview.

Trial results were also reported on Tuesday in the New England Journal of Medicine, along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared “compelling” at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs.

But the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a “limited subpopulation of patients with asthma” because only 21 percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria.

“We do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations,” the editorial said, including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils.",1
"They made some interesting observations about gene mutations that were already known to cause heart diseases, but the Del Sontros offered the possibility of discovering an entirely new genetic pathway to heart disease. Now, eight family members have joined the study, and Dr. Biesecker is searching for more.

Even so, finding the tiny, troublemaking genetic glitches in the family’s genes is an intimidating task. There are 30,000 genes in each person’s DNA, and each gene is can be made up of a string of hundreds of DNA letters and can harbor variations.

Most of the variations are meaningless. In the entire DNA — which contains genes and regions that control genes — there are six billion DNA letters to check. To figure out what DNA changes might be important, the researchers are comparing the DNA sequences of Rick Del Sontro and his family with those of others in the study, looking for genetic changes that occur in every member of the Del Sontro family who has heart disease but that are not generally found in healthy people.

Dr. Biesecker acknowledged that there was no guarantee of success. He and his colleagues know the gene mutation in the Del Sontro family must be rare. Otherwise, lots of people would have early heart disease but no obvious risk factors. To keep the focus on truly rare mutations, the researchers are excluding those that are present in both members of the Del Sontro family and 3 percent or more of the other study participants. That strategy alone, Dr. Biesecker said, has eliminated the vast majority of candidate genes.

The researchers are now searching for culprits among genes that remain — a search that could take years. Or the change might be in a poorly understood region of DNA that controls genes rather than in a gene itself. Researchers’ ignorance of these control regions and what many of them do might doom the effort. So the researchers are hoping the Del Sontro family’s heart disease is caused by a mutated gene.

“Our main job is to find the gene,” Dr. Biesecker said.

Still, Mr. Del Sontro is preparing for the worst. He has life insurance and long-term care insurance.

“I keep waiting for the day when I have shortness of breath,” he said.

When his heart disease was first diagnosed four and a half years ago, Mr. Del Sontro, now 50, told his cardiologist he wanted to run one more Bay to Breakers race, a century-old 12-kilometer race in San Francisco. His doctor told him absolutely not, saying, “You are the kind of guy we will read about who dies during the race of a massive heart attack.” Mr. Del Sontro could still exercise, his cardiologist said, but no more than 45 minutes a day.",1

A breakthrough in helping the body to produce more insulin could make tedious injections of the hormone history.

In type 2 diabetes, the body gradually loses its ability to make enough insulin to keep up with the sugar coming in from the diet. Eventually, the overwhelmed system leaves these sugars, in the form of glucose, to build up in the blood, which can lead to obesity, damage the heart, and cause other metabolic problems.

And while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose, keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren’t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease. But despite decades of research, scientists haven’t found a better way to address the problem.

MORE: Half of Diabetes Cases Are Undiagnosed

Now, researchers working with mice at the Harvard Stem Cell Institute report in the journal Cell that they have discovered a hormone, betatrophin, that can prompt the body to generate more insulin-producing beta cells and, if the work is confirmed, the hormone could potentially do away with the need for regular insulin shots.

“We don’t understand the cause of type 2 diabetes, but everyone agrees that having more beta cells is better,” says Douglas Melton, senior author of the paper and co-director of the Harvard Stem Cell Institute. “No one doubts that’s not a good idea.”

MORE: Should You Take Statins? Study Says Heart Benefits Outweigh Diabetes Risk

It’s an exciting breakthrough in diabetes research, which for many years was focused on finding ways to externally supplement the body’s waning insulin levels. That’s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells, the body’s insulin-making factories, were compromised, they couldn’t be made to work again. What’s more, they also surmised that only a specialized set of beta cells were equipped to make insulin, and that once diabetes set in, too few of these cells remained to pump out the critical hormone.

Melton, however, whose work focuses on understanding how stem cells might enhance beta cell production, admits that he is “obsessed” with the insulin-making cells, and reported in 2007 that all beta cells appeared to have the ability to produce insulin. His pursuit of a better understanding of this population, and the forces that cause them to falter in diabetes, led his team to the discovery of betatrophin.

MORE: Stem Cell Research: The Quest Resumes

In animal studies, mice that were treated with another compound that compromised their ability to respond to insulin suddenly revved up production of more beta cells to compensate, and Melton’s team was able to isolate the hormone responsible – betatrophin. Over the course of a few weeks, mice bred to develop diabetes but injected with betatrophin were increased their beta cell population by 17 times. “I was impressed by the fact that the number of beta cells in the mice doubled in one week with one injection,” says Melton. “That’s a huge difference.”

What’s more, it appears the cells are relatively long-lasting, which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control.

In theory, if the same results occur in people, it’s possible that those on the verge of developing diabetes might never progress to develop the disease, since the high blood sugar levels that can cause damage to tissues and lead the body to become less responsive to insulin could be avoided. It’s also possible that diabetics could lower their dependence on insulin and might even be able to wean themselves off of the injection altogether if their beta cell production is robust enough to provide the insulin they need.

MORE: Type 2 Diabetes Is Tougher to Treat in Kids and Teens

“Even if it doesn’t address insulin resistance, what [betatrophin] will do is lower blood sugar, and anything that lowers blood sugar can make you healthier,” he says.

More work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible, however. John Anderson, president of medicine and science for the American Diabetes Association, says “It’s very promising and opens up new avenues of research, but we are a long way from replacing insulin, or a cure, or even knowing how this [hormone] will work in human tissue.”

Those concerns aren’t lost on Melton, who also recognizes that more research is needed to confirm that betatrophin may benefit patients. “I am aware of the fact that given our level of ignorance, everything seems simple and straightforward,” he says. “But I am prepared to have it become more complicated.”",1

SUNDAY, April 14, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A method designed to target, freeze and destroy a tumor's cellular function seems effective in combating lung tumors, a small ongoing study finds.

At least in the short-run -- meaning three months after the procedure -- the intervention known as ""cryoablation"" appeared to kill all targeted tumors that had spread to the lung from elsewhere, preliminary results suggest.

However, some patients developed new tumors in that time period, the researchers noted.

The study authors cautioned that while the initial findings are encouraging, the treatment should not be seen as a cure for this type of metastatic (spreading) lung disease. Rather, they said that for certain patients who may not be eligible for more standard surgical approaches, the therapy has potential as an alternative means for offering an improved quality of life for a longer period of time.

""'Promising' is the perfect way to describe our findings,"" said study lead author Dr. David Woodrum, an interventional radiologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""But whether or not this minimally invasive approach would ultimately become a primary method of treatment in the future will depend on the long-term results of this trial, which is still under way. At this point I would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last-ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons.""

Woodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings Sunday in New Orleans at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology. Funding for their work was provided by Galil Medical, a medical device manufacturer based in Arden Hills, Minn.

Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

The U.S. National Cancer Institute points out that while cryoablation (also known as cryosurgery) is a well-known practice, researchers are still in the process of assessing its long-term benefits.

The procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist on patients coping with metastasized lung tumors, the researchers noted. Using CT-imaging equipment, the physician inserts a small needle-like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power (at temperatures as low as minus 100 degrees Celsius) of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells, while sparing healthy surrounding tissue.

To date, the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of 36 tumors in 22 American and French patients --13 men and nine women -- whose average age was 60. Fifteen patients had just one tumor, while the rest had two or more. None of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions.

The targeted tumors were less than 3.5 centimeters (about 1.4 inches), which Woodrum described as being ""small to medium in size.""

The procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation, and lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to nearly three hours. Typically, patients were able to return home the following day.

The result: Among the 15 patients seen roughly three months post-procedure, tumor control was found to be 100 percent, although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim.

Among five patients seen six months after the procedure, tumor control continued to be 100 percent.

The authors noted that side effects were minimal, typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure, and in all cases were resolved quickly.

The team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective, at least in the short-term. But they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment's impact over the long haul.

""It would be overreaching to say that we're curing cancer with this,"" Woodrum said. ""But this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight, and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications.""

For his part, Dr. David Carbone, a professor and director of the James Thoracic Center at the Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center, said that the findings regarding cryoablation are ""not incredibly novel,"" given that the procedure has been around for years.

""And I would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach,"" he added. He mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery -- which targets the tumor with high-power X-rays -- as another way to go.

""While I've done cryoablation myself in the past, it's not what I typically do,"" Carbone noted. ""Stereotactic is noninvasive and doesn't require general anesthesia, so that's what I'd tend to do, although certainly what approach is ideal will depend on a particular patient's situation and symptoms. But there's no situation in which cryoablation would be the only theoretical option.""

WEDNESDAY, April 3, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A new class of sleep medications appears to help people fall asleep without causing grogginess the next day, researchers say.

These new medications -- known as dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORA) -- target a more specific region of the brain than popular sleep drugs such as Ambien and Lunesta, promoting sleep without affecting learning and memory (also called ""cognition""), according to the new research.

""We've shown that these compounds improve sleep at doses that don't impact cognition,"" said Jason Uslaner, lead author of a study published in the April 3 issue of Science Translational Medicine. Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study.

Merck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA).

More than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out.

But widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day.

Lunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner.

About 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep.

The appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they ""target a system that's more specific for sleep.""

That means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained.

Uslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys.

DORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo.

In each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the ""control"" drugs.

This is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

But many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way?

Those questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said.

Experts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A study in rats and monkeys suggests an experimental Merck & Co sleep drug may help induce sleep without causing the memory loss and attention problems sometimes seen in the commonly used drugs Ambien and Lunesta, company researchers said on Wednesday.

Experiments in animals suggest Merck’s sleep drug Suvorexant, now before the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, may avoid these side effects, the company said.

Insomnia affects about 10 percent of U.S. adults, and roughly a third of these individuals take drugs to help them sleep. Most sleep aids, including Sanofi’s Ambien or Sunovion Pharmaceuticals’ Lunesta, act on a key neurotransmitter in the brain called GABA.

“These treatments work by forcing the brain to go to sleep,” said study leader Jason Uslaner of Merck in an interview on the website of Science Translational Medicine, which published the study.

GABA receptors are important to many brain regions, including those important for cognition, which is likely why common sleep aids can cause memory loss and attention problems.

“When you hit those, you don’t just hit the sleep system,” John Renger, executive director and head of neruoscience basic research at Merck and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview.

Suvorexant is part of a class of drugs called Dual Orexin Receptor Antagonists or DORAs, which work by blocking chemical messengers called orexins. Orexins are responsible for keeping people awake. Levels of this compound rise during the day and fall at night.

Orexins originate in a specific region of the hypothalamus, so targeting them may have less impact on other brain functions, Renger said.

For this study, the team wanted to find out what would happen if someone is awakened on this drug and has a very high level of it in their system.

“How impaired would they be?” Renger said.

To test this, the researchers did a series of experiments on rhesus monkeys and rats. First, the team trained monkeys to perform a common attention test in which they needed to respond quickly to a blinking light on a screen and remember what they touched. Monkeys given GABA inhibitors were much slower in responding to the prompt, and in some cases, missed it altogether, while monkeys given a potent orexin blocker called DORA-22 did not show these attention issues, Renger said.

The team also saw differences in a simple memory test in rats. Rats were first exposed to a colored object, and then later exposed to it again. Typically, rats that recall an object show less interest in it when they are shown it again.

In the study, rats given GABA blockers were less likely to recall the objects than those given DORA-22.

Emmanuel Mignot of Stanford University, who wrote a commentary on the study in the same journal, said the findings show promise.

“Are DORAs the perfect hypnotics? Only long-term use in large numbers of insomnia patients will reveal whether these drugs will be preferred to GABAergic hypnotics, and whether they produce rare complications, including narcolepsy-like symptoms in predisposed individuals,” Mignot wrote.

So far, Merck has not seen any cases of narcolepsy, a sleep disorder marked by daytime sleepiness, in its late-stage clinical trials, Renger said.

The most common side effects from Suvorexant have been headache and sleepiness. No serious drug-related side effects have been reported.",1
"From a crusty baguette to a big thick steak, some foods may be hard to digest, particularly as we age. Enzyme capsules taken before a meal can relieve discomfort by helping the body to break down problem foods, say companies that sell the pills. Doctors say some enzyme supplements work well, but others need more human studies.

Digestive enzymes are proteins that work like scissors to break down foods. The pancreas, where many of these enzymes are made, can slow down as we age, which can result in bloating and other gastrointestinal discomfort, says Steven Lamm, clinical assistant professor at New York University School of Medicine and a paid consultant to Enzymedica Inc., a Venice, Fla., company that sells enzyme capsules. Gastroenterologists say it is true the pancreas can slow down with age, but gastrointestinal upsets can be from many causes.

Prescription enzymes are often given to patients who have ""pancreatic insufficiency,"" in which the pancreas doesn't make enough enzymes to digest food, doctors say. But many people with milder gastrointestinal problems—such as gas and bloating—are turning to enzymatic dietary supplements for relief. Sales of over-the-counter digestive enzymes in the U.S. hit $136 million in the past 12 months, up 4% from two years ago, according to Spins LLC, a Schaumburg, Ill., market-research firm.

The concept of an over-the-counter enzyme blend seems ""reasonable"" but ""there are not high-quality, well-designed studies"" that prove they work in humans, says Lin Chang, director of the digestive health and nutrition clinic at the University of California in Los Angeles.

Also, says David Whitcomb, a professor of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh, many over-the-counter enzymes are made in fungi—resulting in proteins that digest food efficiently but haven't been tested for humans.

The first over-the-counter enzymes to hit the U.S. market had narrow applications. Lactase, an enzyme that digests a sugar in milk and is lacking in lactose-intolerant people, went on sale in pill form in the 1980s. In 1991, alpha-galactosidase, which aids in digesting beans, cabbage and broccoli, appeared under the brand name Beano, now sold by Medtech Products Inc., Tarrytown, N.Y. Lactase works well, doctors say, and at least four small, published human trials have found the main ingredient in Beano can reduce gas after a meal of beans.

Many newer products aimed at a broader spectrum of foods and digestive concerns are now on the market, but they haven't been tested in human trials. Enzymedica's Digest Gold is a blend of enzymes, including proteases for digesting protein; amylase, for starches and lipase, for fat. Mega-Zyme, sold by a North American unit of Germany's Dr. Willmar Schwabe GmbH & Co. in Green Bay, Wis., contains a powerful enzyme blend the company's website says can ""help relieve occasional gas and bloating.""

Neither company has done clinical trials on its enzyme products, though Enzymedica says it is planning human trials. Both companies say lab tests show their enzymes do what they are expected to do. For example, says Jeremy Appleton, a naturopathic doctor at Schwabe, proteases are tested to make sure they efficiently break down proteins. He says Schwabe doesn't know of any side effects but adds people with fungal allergies should use the products with caution.

A number of products, such Enzymedica's Gluten Ease 2x, which hit the market last year, are aimed at people who get sick from eating gluten. Humans haven't evolved with the ability to fully digest gluten, says Alessio Fasano, director of the Center for Celiac Research at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. In most people, gluten doesn't cause problems, but in people with celiac disease, it causes an autoimmune reaction, Dr. Fasano says. People with ""gluten sensitivity"" can have symptoms such as stomach aches, joint pain, fatigue and headaches, he adds.

Enzymedica's website notes the product isn't for celiac patients, who need to avoid even trace amounts of gluten. Dr. Fasano agrees, but says patients with gluten sensitivity could try the enzymes. But since the enzymes can work slowly, he says he is skeptical the capsules will work fast enough for many patients, who experience symptoms in minutes or hours.

Enzymedica founder Tom Bohager says lab tests show the product works quickly—with an average of 60% large gluten molecules broken down in a half-hour and 75% at 90 minutes. The company says customers have reported only occasional side effects—such as stomach cramping. In the case of cramps, the company recommends reducing the dose.

MONDAY, March 25, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental breath test, designed to quickly identify patients suffering from heart failure simply by analyzing the contents of a single exhaled breath, has demonstrated promise in early trials, a team of researchers says.

The investigators stressed that their evaluation is based on a small group of participating patients, and that more extensive research will have to be done to confirm their initial success.

But by subjecting a patient's breath to a rigorous but fast analysis of the hundreds of so-called volatile organic compounds contained therein, the study team said it has so far been able to correctly diagnose heart failure among newly hospitalized patients with a 100 percent accuracy.

""Every individual has a breath print that differentiates them from other people, depending on what's going on in their body,"" explained study lead author Dr. Raed Dweik, a staff physician in the department of pulmonary, allergy and critical care medicine with the Respiratory Institute at Cleveland Clinic. ""And that print can tell us a lot about a person, what they've been exposed to and what disease they have,"" he added.

""That's what makes the new field of breath testing so promising, because it is non-intrusive, so there is no risk involved,"" Dweik said. ""And you can do it anywhere, in a clinic, in a hospital, anywhere.""

The findings were published March 25 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

The study authors pointed out that the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure -- a tough-to-treat condition in which the heart's pumping action grows gradually weaker over time.

Currently, a diagnosis of heart failure comes from a variety of factors, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists.

In the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic.

Of those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of ""acute decompensated heart failure"" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison.

Within two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon ""mass spectrometry"" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure.

The result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue.

Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital.

""If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,"" he said. ""But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient's history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor's office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,"" he noted.

""So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,"" Fonarow said. ""But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting.""

Study author Dweik added that the test is ""theoretically cheap. But of course we're still early in the process of exploring its potential. This study is really a proof of concept. There is much more work that needs to be done to get it to the point where it would become widely available.""

Hip replacement involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. In a break from past practice, some surgeons prefer to cut into the joint from the front. (ANTHONY UNGER/ANTHONY UNGER)

Over the past two decades, the number of Americans having total hip replacements has more than doubled, to more than 300,000 a year. Though most patients eventually walk again without pain or the aid of a cane, recovery and rehabilitation can be rigorous, painful and lengthy.

The surgery is extensive: As its name suggests, it involves removing the joint — the damaged bone and cartilage — and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal, plastic or ceramics. Typically, surgeons enter the joint from the rear, which requires cutting through muscle and cartilage. But with a relatively new procedure, surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside, avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time. According to those who use this anterior technique, the benefits are substantial.

Anthony Unger, medical director at the Institute of Bone and Joint Health at Sibley Memorial Hospital and a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at George Washington University Hospital, says the anterior approach is “truly minimally invasive.” Unger, who has done about 4,000 hip replacements over 26 years and has used the anterior technique for the past eight years, says “patients have better overall functionality, can sleep on their sides and be confident the new hip won’t dislocate.”

But, as with many transitions in medical techniques, some surgeons have been reluctant to change. Although agencies and hospitals don’t track hip replacements by the type of procedure used, Unger says that, based on statistics from the American Association of Hip and Knee Surgeons, only 20 percent of its members choose the anterior approach.

Joshua Jacobs, a vice president of the American Association of Orthopaedic Surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at Rush University in Chicago, says the AAOS doesn’t “endorse or promote one specific technique or procedure over another.” Jacobs prefers the posterior approach, which he says has been reliable for him.

He says that while he’s heard about the benefits of the anterior approach, he’s “not aware of a randomized, controlled trial comparing the posterior and anterior approach that shows a definite superiority of one over the other.” What’s key is that “surgeons need to do the approach they’re most comfortable with to get the best outcomes.”

Teetering ‘like Chaplin’

A study by Unger in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery in 2011 found that with the anterior procedure, there was less muscle damage and inflammation both in the immediate postoperative period and two days later than with the posterior approach.

Others surgeons who prefer the anterior procedure say it preserves more of the normal anatomy, which also means fewer medications and shorter hospital stays. Michael Bollinger, who operates at Palm Drive Hospital in Sebastopol, Calif., switched methods a few years ago.

With the anterior approach, Bollinger says, “we can take

X-rays during the operation, to see if the new hip is placed correctly and adjust it, when necessary.” Many surgeons use a special operating table that makes this possible.

Although surgeons can also take X-rays during the posterior procedure, it is much more difficult, and they wait until patients are in the recovery room, where, Bollinger says, “there’s not much that can be done.” He explains that while the body “tolerates an imperfect alignment pretty well, if a new hip gets dislocated, it’s often because it’s not in perfectly.”

The anterior approach offers other benefits.

Robert Saunders, a nurse at Alta Bates Summit Medical Center in Berkeley, Calif., sees about 200 hip replacement patients a year. He says that “nurses love the anterior approach” because there’s less worry about dislocating the joint. “With the posterior approach, we have to spread patients’ legs apart and strap them to a pillow to keep the new joint in place. If they want to move or roll over, they can’t,” he says.

Saunders says the anterior patients also have an easier time with physical therapy, which can start the same day as the surgery. “Those who’ve had the posterior procedure have a lot of pain, since, when they sit up, they’re right on top the incision,” he explains.

Patrick Kennelly, a physical therapist with Smartherapy in Chevy Chase, says people who have the anterior procedure “don’t feel so weak, because their hip muscles haven’t been cut. If they’ve had the posterior procedure, even if they don’t consciously feel weak, they tend to shift their weight onto one foot and teeter like [Charlie] Chaplin.”

Cautious surgeons

Given benefits such as these, why haven’t more surgeons switched methods? Unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years, have fine results, and see no need to switch. Also, he says, they work in a “very high-stress, high-liability environment. For this reason, new techniques are adapted slowly with extreme care, and in some cases, not at all.”

Unger adds that surgeons are naturally cautious and typically wait to see results from many studies before they switch methods. Besides his study, there have only been a few others. One, a prospective, randomized study by William Barrett, an orthopedic surgeon in the Seattle area, compared the two approaches in a peer-reviewed paper he presented at the 2012 annual AAOS meeting and found benefits with the anterior approach.

Another obstacle to the widespread use of the newer approach is that if established surgeons want to switch, they face time and cost constraints. They must get training in classes and cadaver labs, and the learning curve can be steep. Unger says his was relatively short — about 20 cases. Others say it took about 50 cases.

And this creates economic issues. “If you’re a busy surgeon, you have a volume to maintain,” Bollinger says, “and it’s hard to go from doing three a day to one during the learning period.”

Christopher Chen, a surgeon who uses the anterior approach at Alta Bates Summit, adds that most doctors “still use the posterior approach because it’s the one they were taught.” And, he says, the majority of younger surgeons learn the older approach because established surgeons are typically the ones who staff the residency training programs and demonstrate the method they know best.

Most surgeons don’t profit from choosing one approach over another, Chen says. “If there is a financial incentive” for promoting the newer technique, he says, “it is that more patients will want the anterior approach, so that the surgeon does more surgeries, and therefore collects more professional fees for that.”

William Hamilton, who operates at the Anderson Orthopaedic Clinic at Inova Mt. Vernon Hospital, trains young surgeons to do the anterior approach in a year-long hip and knee replacement fellowship program. Hamilton says that “during this time, they’re taught both approaches.” But he adds that “since 2009, of the 13 fellows he trained, 12 use the anterior procedure as their primary approach in their practices.”

Hamilton says that “a decade ago, very few residencies and fellowships taught the anterior approach. Now, several institutions around the country have at least one surgeon teaching it. So when students leave and begin their practices, it’s no longer foreign to them.”

Hamilton, who has performed 1,100 anterior procedures and strongly supports the method, says that despite growing interest, “it will take a generation of new surgeons” before use of the anterior approach is widespread.

Patients aren’t informed

Many patients aren’t aware of the option. The case of Daniel Ellsberg — who in 1971 released the Pentagon Papers, a secret study about U.S. involvement in Vietnam — is instructive. His hip had been hurting for about a year, and when he decided to have surgery, his primary-care physician recommended a respected surgeon. Just days before the operation last July, a friend told him about the anterior approach.

“I’d never heard of it, and neither my doctor nor surgeon mentioned it. I called the surgeon’s office, learned he did the posterior procedure, asked for and got a recommendation for one who performs the anterior one, and my experience was amazing. The same day as the operation, I walked down the hall with a walker. I was home in three days, and a week later, [I] walked one or two blocks without pain or a cane. In a month, I bodysurfed at the beach,” says Ellsberg, who is 81 .

Margot Machol, who is two decades younger and lives in Washington, had both hips replaced — the first with the posterior procedure several years ago, the second with the anterior procedure last October. Unger performed both surgeries.

“After the first, I needed pain medicine when I came home from the hospital. Also, I had a long list of restrictions of what I could and couldn’t do so the hip wouldn’t pop out. For six weeks, I had to sleep on my back, couldn’t cross my legs and wasn’t able to drive.

“After the second, I didn’t take any pain pills once I was home, slept on my side soon after the surgery, had almost no rules and drove my car in two weeks. I even wanted to ski over Christmas, because I felt fine,” Machol says.

"* Deep brain-stimulation device helped stabilise mood

* Half of patients in small trial gained weight

* Anorexia among most common psychiatric disorders in girls

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, March 7 (Reuters) - Scientists have for the first time reported successful use of a brain-stimulating implant to help patients with severe anorexia whose condition had not improved with other treatments.

Doctors implanted a device similar to a pacemaker in the brains of six severe anorexics and found at least half put on weight and showed improvements in mood. Under previous therapies, none had shown progress.

This success, in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique, suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation (DBS) device, the researchers wrote in the medical journal The Lancet.

Anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between 15 and 19 years. Symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient, and a need to control calorie intake and output.

Treatment usually focuses on changing behaviour, but experts say up to 20 percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely.

Commenting on the results of this small trial, Janet Treasure and Ulrike Schmidt of King’s College London’s Institute of Psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia.

“The fact that the procedure was associated ... with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance,” they said.

“(This) will go some way towards reassuring patients that DBS is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better.”

DBS is used to treat several neurological illnesses including Parkinson’s disease and chronic pain. Scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy, but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia.

Implanting the DBS device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur, the researchers said.

For their study, a team at the Krembil Neuroscience Centre and University Health Network in Canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using DBS in depression.

They implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin. The devices were activated 10 days later and researchers measured changes in the patients’ mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation.

The patients, all women, were aged between 24 and 57 and had had anorexia for between four and 37 years.

Initially all six lost weight, but researchers said this was expected since studies of DBS in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work.

Three months after treatment, the weight loss began to reverse in some patients, and after nine months, three patients weighed more than before treatment - the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill. Around half also had better moods and less obsessive-compulsive behaviour.

Andres Lozano, who led the study, said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect, rather than a placebo or hunger-increasing effect.

He also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were “especially striking” given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies. (Editing by Andrew Roche)",1

MONDAY, March 4, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- People suffering from restless legs syndrome may find some relief by taking one of several drugs approved to treat the condition, a new review confirms.

The medications, which include Requip (ropinirole), levodopa, Neurontin (gabapentin) and Lyrica (pregabalin), appear to reduce symptoms of the syndrome in more than 60 percent of patients, researchers report. The first two drugs raise dopamine levels in the body, and the last two drugs reduce the amount of calcium reaching brain cells and trigger the production of other chemicals that help reduce pain. Dopamine is a brain chemical that regulates movement and mood.

""Physicians and patients now have better information on the effectiveness and harms of two types of drug treatments for patients with at least moderately severe restless legs symptoms in which to guide treatment choices,"" said review author Dr. Timothy Wilt, core investigator at the Minneapolis VA Health Care System.

Restless legs syndrome causes a person to feel a powerful urge to move his or her legs. The legs become uncomfortable when lying down or sitting, and the condition can disrupt sleep and take a toll on the quality of life, the researchers said.

One expert, Dr. Martin Niethammer, a neurologist at the Movement Disorders Center of North Shore-LIJ's Cushing Neuroscience Institute in Manhasset, N.Y., said this study is merely a review of the current treatments for restless legs syndrome.

""There is nothing new here at all,"" he said. ""It doesn't add anything to the field.""

This is just a compilation of evidence that follows guidelines that have been long established in both Europe and the United States, Niethammer said.

""These are the only treatments approved by the [U.S. Food and Drug Administration],"" he added.

The report was published in the March 4 online issue of JAMA Internal Medicine.

For the analysis, Wilt's team reviewed 29 clinical trials. The researchers found that 61 percent of those taking dopamine agonists showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms, compared with 41 percent of those taking an inactive placebo.

In addition, those taking dopamine agonists slept better and scored higher on measures of quality of life. Dopamine agonists were originally developed to treat Parkinson's disease.

Side effects of dopamine agonists can include euphoria, hallucinations, weight loss, nausea, insomnia, tiredness or weakness, dizziness and drowsiness.

There are generic versions of Requip that cost far less, running between $11 and $22 a month. Insurance covers the treatment in most cases, so actual out-of-pocket costs will vary by insurance plan. The same is true for levodopa, Wilt said.

Neurontin and Lyrica also helped relieve symptoms in 61 percent of patients, compared with 37 percent of those taking a placebo, the researchers found.

The most common side effects of these drugs include fatigue, swelling in the legs, dizziness and weight gain.

Without insurance, Lyrica costs can run more than $100 a month, but again co-pays will vary by plan, Wilt said. The same is true for Neurontin, which can cost $117 to $135 a month without insurance.

Wilt noted there is no information on the effectiveness of treatments in pregnant women, young or old patients, those with milder symptoms or those with other serious medical conditions. ""We urge caution in extending our conclusions to these individuals,"" he noted.

""Treatments for restless legs syndrome is now frequently advertised direct-to-consumer, and thus while this may enhance awareness it may result in patients seeking treatment for milder or other conditions not well-studied,"" he explained.

The harms of medications may outweigh benefits for these individuals, Wilt said. ""Up to 25 to 50 percent with even moderate to severe and longstanding symptoms stop taking these medications after more than a year due to either side effects or lack of benefit,"" he noted.

Nonetheless, for people with moderate to severe restless legs syndrome symptoms, these medications provided important benefits, at least in the short term, Wilt said.

Patients should tell their doctors if they have bothersome sensations in their legs that include distressing, irresistible urge to move them that is relieved by rest, Wilt said.

""This may be due to restless legs syndrome or other conditions. An accurate diagnosis is important. Effective treatments for restless legs syndrome are available, and in patients with more severe symptoms may include medications,"" he said.

"Taking folic acid before pregnancy, and through the first several weeks of pregnancy, may help reduce the risk of autism for those children, according to a new study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA).

Researchers in Norway looked at data from 85,000 pregnancies, and found that women who took the supplement four weeks before pregnancy, and through the eighth week of pregnancy, were 39% less likely to have children with autism.

The Norwegian study is the largest to date on the benefits of folic acid for autism prevention, and marks one of the first tangible things a woman can do to reduce her risk of giving birth to a child with the disorder.

""This is pretty exciting,"" said Alycia Halladay, senior director for environmental and clinical sciences for Autism Speaks, an autism advocacy group. ""It actually supports the idea of actionable things women can do before they become pregnant, and right as conception happens.""

Experts have known for some time that taking folic acid can prevent neural tube birth defects like spina bifida in developing fetuses. American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) guidelines call for all women of child-bearing age - not just those who plan to get pregnant - to take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent birth defects. The same dose appears to provide some benefit in preventing autism, according to the research.

""This is another piece of evidence that supports the beneficial uses of folic acid during pregnancy,"" said Halladay, who was not connected with the study.

The research ""strongly suggests that taking folic acid prior to pregnancy may reduce the risk of autism in children,"" said Dr. Edward R.B. McCabe, medical director for the March of Dimes. The organization also recommends women of child-bearing age take 400 micrograms of folic acid daily before conceiving and 600 to 800 micrograms per day while pregnant.

But some experts aren't quite ready to tout the benefits of folic acid too loudly, particularly for autism prevention.

""It is possible that folic acid ... might provide protection against other neurodevelopmental disorders like autism,"" said Zachary Warren, director of the Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders at Vanderbilt University, who was also not involved in the study. ""While the current study suggests such protection... the data really do not establish anything close to a causal connection.""

The Norwegian researchers do admit that more studies should be done to confirm the link.

Warren says he wishes the solution were as simple as just taking folic acid. ""Caring for individuals with autism and their families would be a whole lot easier if we had simple answers about cause and risk,"" he says. ""The reality is, autism is a complex disorder and our best answers about causes and treatment are going to be complex as well.""

Despite the fact that a link between taking folic acid and reducing autism risk isn't fully proven, Halladay says there's no harm in taking the supplement, and women should be taking it anyway to prevent birth defects.",1

FRIDAY, Feb. 8, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- For people with celiac disease, everyday foods such as bread, pizza crust and muffins are potential enemies. But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products.

The only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms.

The re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society.

Ideally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said.

An enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure.

In this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. ""We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,"" Siegel said.

The next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. ""It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,"" Siegel said.

How effective might the enzyme be? ""For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,"" Siegel said. ""For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it.""

""For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,"" he added.

The process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. ""We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,"" he said.

Some experts identified limitations to the research.

""This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,"" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. ""Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread.""

Murray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. ""It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,"" he said.

But celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. ""People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,"" Murray said.

A study shows that not all good fats are the same when it comes to protecting your health.

For decades, the message about fats has been relatively simple — reduce the amount of oils and fats you eat from animal and dairy products (less red meat and cheese) and substitute them with healthier fats from plants or fish (olive oil, omega-3 fatty acids). The difference came down to the specific type of fats that make up these foods — animal and dairy fats tend to be saturated, which means all of the free bonds available in a chain of carbon atoms are bound to hydrogen atoms, while plant fats are unsaturated, meaning some of carbon atoms have double bonds with each other. Saturated fats are more likely to build up within artery walls and form plaques that can trigger heart attacks.

But in the latest study on fats published in the BMJ, researchers found convincing evidence that not all plant fats are created equal and that linoleic acid, or omega-6 fatty acids, may be associated with a higher risk of early death from any cause, as well as increased risk of heart disease and death from heart-related conditions.

The study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the Sydney Diet Heart Study, a trial that was conducted from 1966 to 1973. For more than three years, researchers at the time followed 458 men aged 30 to 59 years old who had a history of heart disease; about half were told to replace the saturated fats they consumed from animal and dairy sources with omega-6 linoleic acid, which is commonly found in safflower oil or margarines made from it. The other half were not told to change their diet in any way. When that study was published in 1978, researchers noted an increased risk of early death from any cause among the omega-6 group, but did not break down the data by what caused the deaths.

(MORE: Study: ‘Good’ Fats Even Better for the Heart Than We Thought)

So Dr. Christopher Ramsden, a clinical investigator at the National Institutes of Health, who was interested in understanding the effects of linoleic acid on heart health, contacted one of the original authors and reviewed data that had not been included in the study. This information involved deaths from heart-related causes, and the new analysis showed that the omega-6 group had a 17% higher risk of dying during the study period from heart disease, compared with 11% among the control group.

The American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that people replace 25% to 35% of their daily saturated-fat intake with foods containing unsaturated fats, such as canola and olive oils. The AHA further breaks down the unsaturated-fat advice by suggesting that people devote about 5% to 10% of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid. The recommendation is based on a review of the available data.

(MORE: Study: Eating Omega-3s May Help Reduce Alzheimer’s Risk)

The latest results, however, raise questions about that advice. Ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats, which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks. “I wouldn’t necessarily say that the [current advice] is necessarily completely wrong,” he says. “What happened is that in the 1960s all polyunsaturated fats were considered the same. They were grouped together under one mechanism of being able to lower blood-cholesterol levels. Then, over the ensuing decades, it became clear as science progressed that there were multiple types of polyunsaturated fats, and these compounds potentially have distinct biochemical and health effects.”

There has been some evidence to suggest that omega-6 fatty acids, for example, may trigger inflammation, a condition that is linked to an increased risk of heart problems, while omega-3 fatty acids, found in deepwater fish like salmon, tend to inhibit inflammatory reactions. Ramsden says the results highlight the need to study dietary ingredients in more detail, rather than lumping them together and assuming they have the same effect on the body.

(MORE: Can Olive Oil Help Prevent Stroke?)

Recognizing that need, the AHA says it is considering re-evaluating all its dietary recommendations, and will make the issue of polyunsaturated fats part of this assessment. Reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important, says Alice Lichtenstein, a spokesperson for the association, since changes in one area could have unexpected, and potentially harmful, effects on other eating habits. When health organizations advised people to lower their intake of saturated fats, for example, many replaced the fats with carbohydrates, which can increase risk of diabetes and lead to higher levels of another type of fat in the blood, triglycerides. “One of the things we learned is that we need to look at the whole picture,” says Lichtenstein. “Just looking at one individual component puts undue emphasis on that component, and may lead to unanticipated consequences. We need to look at dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients or individual food components.”

Whether the association will change its advice about consuming linoleic acid isn’t clear yet, but Ramsden says the results of the latest study “could have important implications” for the way people eat if they want to stay heart-healthy.",1

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 6, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Enduring dietary wisdom -- that polyunsaturated vegetable fats are better for your heart than saturated animal fats -- may be turned on its head by a fresh analysis of a nearly 50-year-old study.

The reasoning has been that a diet rich in omega-6 polyunsaturated fats lowers cholesterol, and is therefore good for heart health. But an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death.

The original ""Sydney Diet Heart Study,"" was initially conducted between 1966 and 1973, at a time when the cholesterol-lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids (PUFAs) were touted with a broad brush.

But in the ensuing years, researchers have come to understand that not all PUFAs are alike, with key biochemical differences -- and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts -- observed among multiple types of omega-3s (found in fish oils) and omega-6 linoleic acids.

""There is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid,"" explained Dr. Christopher Ramsden, who headed the re-analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, part of the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

""And so, we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds, linoleic acid, by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods, and also by re-including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis,"" Ramsden explained.

The findings appeared online Feb. 5 in the BMJ.

The 458 male participants in the original study had been between the ages of 30 and 59 at enrollment, and all had a history of heart disease, with most having survived a heart attack.

The men were placed into two groups. The first group was told to consume linoleic acid, in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine, at levels equal to 15 percent of total calorie intake. This, said Ramsden, is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that Americans currently consume.

While omega-3 consumption was not affected, the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than 10 percent of their diets. They did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats, common margarines and shortening oils, salad dressings, baked goods and other products, according to the study.

The second group continued their routine nutritional habits, and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three-year-plus study period.

By newly crunching all the original data the NIH team found that, compared to the no-dietary-change group, the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death, from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall.

In turn, Ramsden's investigators included their Sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega-6 consumption.

Despite the fact the American Heart Association (AHA) currently recommends that 5 percent to 10 percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat (principally from omega-6), the NIH team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits. The review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega-6 consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease.

Ramsden acknowledged that the Sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people: middle-aged men with a history of heart disease, who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both AHA guidelines and the dietary habits of most Americans.

""So, yes, one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations,"" he cautioned.

But he also suggested that his team's rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved.

""What to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the 1960s has turned out to form a much less black-and-white picture,"" he said. ""Polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol-lowering. They may also be involved in inflammation, oxidation or clotting. So, it's a very complex picture. And though our goal is not to come up with diet advice, it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines.""

On that score, American Heart Association spokesperson Penny Kris-Etherton, a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at Pennsylvania State University, suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue.

""But I don't think this is going to change AHA recommendations,"" she said. ""Because there's very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid. The AHA science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies. There are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines.""

""So, I don't think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet,"" Kris-Etherton said. ""Those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful.""

Yoga does the body good, and according to a new study, it may ease the mind as well.

“Yoga has also become such a cultural phenomenon that it has become difficult for physicians and consumers to differentiate legitimate claims from hype,” researchers from Duke University Medical Center write in their study, published in the journal Frontiers in Psychiatry. In order to explore the widely held belief that practicing yoga can relieve mental stress, the team reviewed more than 100 studies on the effect of yoga and mental health.

“Most individuals already know that yoga produces some kind of a calming effect. Individually, people feel better after doing the physical exercise,” says lead study author Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a professor of psychiatry and medicine at Duke University Medical Center. “Mentally, people feel calmer, sharper, maybe more content. We thought it’s time to see if we could pull all [the literature] together … to see if there’s enough evidence that the benefits individual people notice can be used to help people with mental illness.”

(MORE: Yoga Can Help Stroke Survivors Regain Their Balance)

Their findings suggest that yoga does in fact have positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems, and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and ADHD among patients using medication.

The researchers focused on 16 studies that recorded the effects of practicing yoga on mental-health issues ranging from depression, schizophrenia, ADHD, sleep complaints and eating disorders to cognitive problems. They found positive effects of the mind-and-body practice for all conditions with the exception of eating disorders and cognition. Those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions.

Some of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy. For instance, yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters (boosting levels of feel-good agents like serotonin), lower inflammation, reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors — just as other forms of exercise do.

Embracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon. Yoga is a feature in many veterans’ centers throughout the country, backed by research funded by the Department of Veterans Affairs. The Huffington Post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for PTSD, for example, with companies like Warriors at Ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military. A study published earlier this month of 70 active-duty troops found daily yoga eased anxiety and improved sleep.

The researchers say there’s enough evidence to warrant a larger study on the effects of yoga on mental health, and it should be considered as part of treatment for more disorders. “Many millions of Americans are doing yoga and many millions of Americans have mental illnesses and are popping psychiatric pills daily. Despite all of this, the vast majority of studies looking at the benefits of yoga are all small studies. We did not come across a single study where there was a coordinated effort done by some large agency to really conduct a large national study,” says Doraiswamy.

(MORE: Does Yoga Really Drive People Wild with Desire?)

But while the research is promising, yoga likely won’t be a panacea for mental illness. Nor should patients try to replace their medications with the practice. “What we are saying is that we still need to do further, large-scale studies before we are ready to conclude that people with mental illnesses can turn to yoga as a first-line treatment,” says Doraiswamy. “We are not saying throw away your Prozac and turn to yoga. We’re saying it has the promise and potential. If a large national study were done, it could turn out that yoga is just as good and may be a low cost alternative to people with unmet needs.” In the meantime, he says it doesn’t hurt to add yoga to existing treatments so patients can take advantage of any potential benefits.",1

MONDAY, Jan. 28, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Breast-conserving surgery for early stage breast cancers may result in better survival than mastectomy, according to a new study.

For those with early stage breast cancer, ""lumpectomy is just as effective if not more effective than mastectomy,"" said researcher Dr. Shelley Hwang, chief of breast surgery at Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C.

""There are lots of women who think the more [treatment] they do, the better they will do,"" she said. ""This refutes that.""

The findings, published online Jan. 28 in the journal Cancer, are especially strong for women over 50 with hormone-sensitive cancers, the researchers found.

Earlier research had also concluded that the two procedures are similarly effective, but Hwang's is a more ""real-world"" study.

Hwang's team looked at 14 years of data from the California Cancer Registry, following more than 112,000 women with early stage breast cancer (stages 1 or 2) between 1990 and 2004. Ages ranged from 39 to 80.

More than half (55 percent) had lumpectomy and radiation, while 45 percent had mastectomy (complete breast removal) alone.

Hwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone, not mastectomy plus radiation. ""We wanted to look at early stage disease, and those patients typically don't get radiation after mastectomy,"" she said.

The researchers tracked the women's progress for a median of more than nine years (half followed longer, half less). During that time, more than 31,000 women died, nearly 40 percent of them from breast cancer. The others died of other causes.

For the first three years after treatment, those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy. This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said.

Over the entire follow-up, those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer.

""The group that benefited the most -- who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival -- were those women over 50 with estrogen-receptor positive disease,"" Hwang said. This means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow.

Among those women, the lumpectomy group had a 13 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a 19 percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy.

Not all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy, Hwang said. In this procedure, just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed, sparing the rest of the breast. Among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large, or those who have different cancers in the same breast.

The percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently, after a dip in previous years. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it.

The new research, which was funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible, it may actually increase survival, Hwang said.

The findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study.

The study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. ""They broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category,"" she said. ""They looked at socioeconomic status, and they kept it early stage.""

Dr. Wendy Woodward, section chief for breast radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said that for women with early cancers, the study ""clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast-conserving surgery candidates.""

But, Woodward added, ""I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be.""

The study was observational, Hwang stressed. It found a link or association but could not provide cause-and-effect proof that the breast-conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer.

Hwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information. However, ""I don't want women who chose mastectomy to think they did the wrong thing,"" Hwang said. ""At the end of the day, personal preference trumps everything else. I fully support the patient's options to choose the best treatment for themselves.""

"(Reuters) - Vanda Pharmaceuticals Inc said its experimental drug for a rare sleep disorder proved effective in a second late-stage trial, and the company now plans to apply for a U.S. approval for the drug in mid-2013.

The study, named Reset, was a 20-patient trial designed to test the maintenance effect of a 20 mg dose of the drug, tasimelteon.

Vanda on December 18 said the drug performed better than a placebo in the first of the four planned late-stage trials on the drug. The company’s shares rose as much as 37 percent on that day.

While the first two are efficacy studies, the remaining two are intended to establish the safety profile of the drug.

The second trial showed that patients treated by the drug maintained their clinical benefits while placebo-treated patients showed significant deterioration in measures of night-time sleep, daytime naps and timing of sleep.

The drug is being tested for ‘non-24-hour disorder’ that has no approved treatment. The condition, in which a person’s body clock does not automatically set to the 24-hour day, affects a majority of blind people.

“These results also highlight the importance of chronic therapy in treating Non-24,” CEO Mihael Polymeropoulos said in a statement on Wednesday.

Tasimelteon received orphan drug status — which offers several years of marketing exclusivity for drugs developed for rare conditions — from the FDA in 2010 and from the European Commission in 2011.

An orphan drug, if approved, can usually fetch a premium pricing in the market.

Shares of Vanda, which has a market of about $116 million, closed at $4.12 on Tuesday on the Nasdaq. They have gained nearly 8 percent since December 18.",1

The benefits for the heart of eating strawberries and blueberries can build up over a lifetime, according to the latest research.

Bright-colored berries have long been a part of any healthy diet, owing mainly to the anthocyanins that give them their vibrant color and act as antioxidants to fight off damage to cells. Now a study published in the journal Circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit; women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third.

In the study, researchers from the Harvard School of Public Health and the University of East Anglia in the U.K. analyzed data from 93,600 women ages 25 to 42 enrolled in the Nurses’ Health Study II. For 18 years, the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four-year intervals.

(MORE: Study: Flavonoids May Help Protect Against Parkinson’s)

During the study the women experienced 405 heart attacks. But women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a 32% reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less. The women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall, consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn’t eat as many berries; but when the scientists broke down the women’s diets, they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries. The effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart-disease risk, such as obesity, high blood pressure, smoking, low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease.

“These foods can be readily incorporated into diets, and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women,” says study author Aedin Cassidy from the University of East Anglia. “This supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible.”

So what is it about berries that help the heart? The researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the U.S. Both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins, as well as other flavonoids, which fight the effects of stress and free-radical damage to cells as they age. They can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible, which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture, causing heart attacks.

(MORE: Can Eating Fruits and Veggies Outwit Bad Heart Genes?)

The results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart-disease risk for relatively young women. That means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman’s risk of having a heart attack later in life, possibly even insulating her from heart problems. “Although we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids, and their effects in wine and chocolate, it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time,” says Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, director of women and heart disease at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved in the study. “The take-home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life, you’re getting benefits that last for life. When we’re making choices in our 20s, we may think that a burger and fries is great, but the message is that there are alternatives that make a difference for the rest of your life. It is a powerful message that we can prevent cardiovascular disease by what we eat.” Something worth remembering the next time you’re in the produce aisle.",1

MONDAY, Jan. 14, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Eating three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries each week may help reduce a woman's risk of heart attack, a large new study suggests.

The study included nearly 94,000 young and middle-aged women who took part in the Nurses' Health Study II. The women completed questionnaires about their diet every four years for 18 years.

During the study period, 405 participants had heart attacks. Women who ate the most blueberries and strawberries were 32 percent less likely to have a heart attack, compared to women who ate berries once a month or less. This held true even among women who ate a diet rich in other fruits and vegetables.

This benefit was independent of other heart risk factors such as advancing age, high blood pressure, family history of heart attack, body mass index, exercise, smoking, and caffeine and alcohol intake. The findings appear online Jan. 14 in the journal Circulation.

The study can't say specifically what about the berries seemed to result in a lower risk of heart attack among these women, or that there was a direct cause-and-effect link between eating the berries and lowered heart attack risk. But blueberries and strawberries contain high levels of compounds that may help widen arteries, which counters plaque buildup, the researchers said. Heart attacks can occur when plaque blocks blood flow to the heart.

""Berries were the most commonly consumed sources of these substances in the U.S. diet, and they are one of the best sources of these powerful bioactive compounds,"" said study lead author Aedin Cassidy. ""These substances, called anthocyanins -- a flavonoid -- are naturally present in red- and blue-colored fruits and vegetables, so they are also found in high amounts in cherries, grapes, eggplant, black currants, plums and other berries.""

Men are likely to benefit from eating berries as well, although this study included only women, said Cassidy, who is head of the department of nutrition at Norwich Medical School at the University of East Anglia, in England.

Although more research is needed to confirm these benefits, ""these data are important from a public health perspective because these fruits can be readily incorporated into the habitual diet,"" the study concluded.

Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, noted that this was a ""huge study that followed women for a long period of time. Women who ate three or more servings of strawberries and blueberries per week decreased their heart attack risk by one-third. This is pretty compelling.""

Steinbaum's advice to both women and men is to include berries in their diet, and make them part of their daily fruit and vegetable fill.

One serving of blueberries or strawberries equals about one cup.

Dana Greene, a nutritionist in Boston, regularly tells her patients to consume more fruits and vegetables, including berries.

""They are so good for you,"" Greene said. Besides flavonoids, berries also are loaded with other nutrients, including vitamin C, potassium and folate.

""I tell all patients to make sure that half of their plate is filled with fruits and vegetables, especially richly colored ones like blueberries and strawberries,"" Greene said. ""Berries can also help people lose weight and maintain that loss because they feel fuller faster. There is no downside.""

The study was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the U.K. Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 9, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Women with heavy menstrual bleeding may find some relief using an intrauterine device, or IUD, containing the hormone levonorgestrel, according to new research.

British researchers found that the treated IUD was more effective at reducing the effects of heavy menstrual bleeding (also called menorrhagia) on quality of life compared to other treatments. Normally used for contraception, the intrauterine system is sold under the brand name Mirena.

""If women suffer with heavy periods and do not want to get pregnant -- as the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a contraceptive -- then having the levonorgestrel intrauterine system is a very good first-line treatment option that does not require taking regular, daily oral medications,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Janesh Gupta, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Birmingham and Birmingham Women's Hospital in England.

For women who do want to get pregnant, Gupta said, taking the blood-clotting drug tranexamic acid during periods is an alternate method of treating heavy periods.

Results of the study, which was funded by the United Kingdom's National Institute of Health Research, appear in the Jan. 10 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Heavy menstrual bleeding is a significant problem for many women. About 20 percent of gynecologist office visits in the United States and the United Kingdom are because of heavy bleeding. There are several nonhormonal and hormonal treatment options available to reduce blood loss.

The current study compared the use of traditional medical options -- tranexamic acid pills, mefenamic acid (Ponstel), combined estrogen-progestogen and progesterone alone -- to the use of the levonorgestrel intrauterine system.

The researchers randomly assigned nearly 600 women with heavy menstrual bleeding to receive either the IUD or standard medical care. They assessed improvement using a patient-reported score on a scale designed to measure severity of symptoms. The scale goes from 0 to 100, with lower scores indicating more severe symptoms. The researchers also asked about quality of life and sexual activity, and noted whether a woman needed surgery for heavy periods.

Women in the IUD group reported much greater improvement -- 32.7 points on the symptom scale versus 21.4 points in the standard treatment group. They also reported greater improvements in quality of life.

There was no difference in the rates of surgery or sexual activity between the two groups.

More women were still using the intrauterine system after two years than were still taking standard medical treatments -- 64 percent compared to 38 percent.

Gupta said the main reason she believes the IUD group was more successful at reducing symptoms is that there is ""100 percent compliance with treatment as there is a continuous drug treatment effect."" Women taking medications may forget to take them sometimes.

Serious side effects were similar between the groups. Gupta said the main side effect from the intrauterine system is irregular periods for up to six months.

Another expert said the findings show promise for women bothered by heavy bleeding.

""This study really adds to the evidence that shows how useful this intrauterine system is for heavy menstrual bleeding,"" said Dr. Eve Espey, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico School of Medicine in Albuquerque.

Getting an intrauterine system generally just requires one office visit, Espey said. Insertion of the device may be mildly uncomfortable for some women, she said.

For women who may be hesitant to use an IUD because of pelvic infections linked to an early version called the Dalkon Shield, Gupta said that as long as women are screened for sexually transmitted diseases before getting an intrauterine system, the risk of infection is low.

Espey agreed. ""Today's intrauterine systems have a great side-effect profile,"" she said. ""They also have a high continuation and a high satisfaction rate.""

"* Ebselen works like lithium in mouse study

* Standard treatment lithium discovered 60 years ago

* Scientists say new drug could have fewer side effects

By Kate Kelland

LONDON, Jan 8 (Reuters) - A drug for bipolar disorder that works like lithium - the most common and effective treatment - but without lithium’s side-effects has been identified by British researchers in tests on mice.

Scientists say the drug, ebselen, may be a swift answer to long-sought after better medications for patients with the manic depressive disorder, since it is already known to be safe.

If the drug could be “repurposed” and licensed for the treatment of bipolar disorder, it could reduce the unpleasant side effects of weight gain, thirst and potential kidney damage that patients risk when taking lithium.

“Ebselen is an experimental drug that has been tested in people for other conditions, and does not have problematic side effects like lithium does,” said Grant Churchill of the department of pharmacology at Britain’s Oxford University.

Bipolar disorder effects around 1 percent of the population worldwide and sufferers can experience moods that swing from one extreme to another, and have periods of depression and mania lasting several weeks or longer. These high and low phases are often so extreme they interfere with everyday life and work.

In a telephone interview Churchill said that in tests, his team found that mice who were made manic with small doses of amphetamines were able to be calmed again with ebselen.

“In mice, ebselen works like lithium,” Churchill said. “Now we urgently need to see if it works like lithium in people.”

Some 60 years after it was first discovered, lithium - a mood stabiliser that can protect against both depression and mania, and reduce the risk of suicide - remains the most effective long-term treatment.

But it is very toxic - at only twice the right dose it could kill a patient, Churchill said - and its adverse side-effects mean many people stop taking the drug and relapse into episodes of mania and depression.

Churchill worked with Sridhar Vasudevan to filter through a library of existing drugs - the U.S. National Institutes of Health Clinical Collection - that are considered safe but do not currently have a proven use.

They screened the library for any drugs that blocked an enzyme that is key to lithium’s success and found ebselen was a possible lithium mimic.

“This is one of the first handful of examples of drug repurposing, where a new use has been found for an existing drug,” Vasudevan said.

Ebselen is an antioxidant originally developed up to late stage, or phase III, clinical trials by the Japanese firm Daiichi Sankyo for the treatment of stroke, but which never reached market and is now out of patent.

Vasudevan said his study, reported in the journal Nature Communications, showed ebselen had the same or similar action as lithium in the brains of mice, blocking the same enzyme.

The researchers are a now starting a small study in healthy human volunteers to look for effects on brain function. If that shows ebselen has similar effects to lithium, they plan to move to second stage trial in bipolar patients. (Editing by Pravin Char)",1
"Jan. 4, 2013 -- A new study from Australia may offer a new way of identifying people at risk of glaucoma years before vision loss happens. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later.

Glaucoma a ‘Vision Thief’ About 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don’t know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD. He is the executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of opthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. “We call this disease a ‘thief of vision’ because most people with it have no idea that they have lost sight until it is too late to bring it back,” Iwach says.",1
"Drug Fulfills Promise Of Research Into Cystic Fibrosis Gene

toggle caption Jeffrey Sauger

The promise of genetic medicine is beginning to be fulfilled, but it's been a long, hard slog.

Take the story of Kalydeco. It's designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis. While not quite a cure, the drug is extremely effective for some CF patients.

But the success of Kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making.

A good starting point for the story is Aug. 24, 1989. That's the day scientists from the U.S. and Canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease. It was the early days of gene hunting, and the CF gene was a big prize.

CF is the most common genetic disease in Caucasians. When people inherit a damaged form of the CF gene, a critical protein inside cells doesn't work properly. As a result, sticky mucus builds up in a patient's lungs, causing infections and making it hard to breathe.

The announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the Sept. 8 issue of Science, but a reporter for Reuters got hold of the story early. Science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication.

At the time, scientists predicted that a genetic test for CF was just around the corner. But they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach.

The first prediction turned out to be right. ""But it wasn't until 20 years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis,"" says Fred Van Goor, who led the team at what is now Vertex Pharmaceuticals that developed Kalydeco. ""So it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of Kalyedco.""

toggle caption Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc.

It took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the CF gene makes. ""We tested over 600,000 chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis,"" says Van Goor.

One of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug, but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth, and so it would last the right length of time in a patient's body.

From the start, Van Goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with Kalydeco: It only works on a small subset of people with CF. They have to have a particular mutation in the CF gene, or the drug is of little use.

But for people who do have that mutation, the drug works remarkably well.

Emily Schaller was in one of the early studies of Kalydeco. As part of the study, researchers first gave her a placebo, then switched her to the active drug. She knew within days that something was different.

""I was with my brother in Florida, and we were walking down the street, and I took a deep breath, and when I took a deep breath in and I let it out, I didn't cough,"" says Schaller. ""But not only did I not cough, but I felt that my lungs were clear, and that something huge had happened. It was just something I had never felt in my life before.""

Schaller isn't cured. She still has a damaged CF gene. The only way to fix that would be gene therapy, where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one. Although it seems simple in theory, in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish.

Schaller isn't particularly bothered by that. ""Everyone talks about curing a disease — cure CF, cure these other diseases. [But] Kalydeco controls CF at the basic defect, so I'm OK with the other 'c' word, control, because I'm living it and I've never felt better in my life.""

The time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening, but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far, and for a while at least, the appearance of new ones will be slow.

They're also likely to be expensive. Kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of $300,000 per year.",1

MONDAY, Dec. 17, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- For patients whose high blood pressure cannot be controlled despite taking several medications, a short burst of radio waves at the nerves around the kidneys may do the trick, a small new study says.

The treatment was effective for at least six months. The findings could be a significant step in treating people with resistant hypertension, which is a major risk factor for heart attack and stroke, the researchers said.

The technique -- called catheter-based renal denervation -- is minimally invasive. In it, doctors use a catheter inserted through the artery in the groin, which sends radio waves burning away nerve tissue around the arteries that feed the kidneys.

The procedure destroys nerves that help control and filter salt in the body and may be overactive in patients with high blood pressure. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration has not yet approved its use.

The study was funded by medical device maker Medtronic. The findings were published Dec. 17 in the journal Circulation.

""This is a very promising approach for managing medication-resistant hypertension,"" said Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a spokesman for the American Heart Association and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles.

""High blood pressure is a major contributor to heart attack, stroke, heart failure, and [kidney] failure,"" said Fonarow, who was not involved in the study. ""Despite the availability of a number of effective medications, many patients with hypertension have not achieved adequate control of their blood pressure. There is thus an important, but currently unmet, need for additional therapies to effectively control hypertension.""

For the study, an international team lead by Dr. Murray Esler, professor and senior director of the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia, assigned 35 patients to renal denervation and compared them to 47 patients who had already had the procedure.

All the patients suffered from drug-resistant hypertension. Their systolic blood pressure -- the top number in a blood-pressure reading -- remained dangerously high at 160 millimeters of mercury (mmHg) or above despite having taking three or more drugs to control blood pressure, the researchers noted.

Esler's team found that more than 83 percent of those who had denervation treatment before had a drop in systolic blood pressure of at least 10 mmHg after six months and almost 79 percent maintained the reduction at 12 months.

The 35 patients in this phase of the study had similar results to the initial group. Almost 63 percent of these patients saw a reduction in systolic blood pressure of 10 mmHg or more six months after treatment.

Fonarow noted: ""In all, reductions in systolic blood-pressure levels on the order of 25 to 30 mmHg were achieved and maintained without any loss in efficacy.""

The procedure is safe as well as effective, the study authors said.

""Participants' kidneys were not damaged or functionally impaired,"" Esler said in a journal news release. ""We also found no ill effects on long-term health from the procedure.""

Whether this technique might be useful in treating less severe high blood pressure hasn't yet been tested. If it is applicable, it could mean patients need not take blood-pressure drugs, Esler suggested.

Another expert, however, said that scenario is likely overoptimistic.

""Hypertension is a hard disease to treat because there are so many things that go into getting blood pressure under control,"" said Dr. Varinder Singh, chairman of cardiology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""There's lifestyle and diet, there is getting to the right doses of medications, there are adherence issues. So anything that will help patients get their goals is exciting.""

Even with this technique, people will most likely still have to take blood-pressure medications, Singh said. ""You may have to take less medication and you may have to take lower doses of medication, but we all expect that patients will still have to take some medication,"" he said.

Singh also noted that although this procedure is used in other countries it is not yet approved in the United States.

Fonarow added: ""While this study demonstrates that renal denervation provides sustained reduction of blood pressure up to one year and appears safe, additional studies with longer-term follow-up are needed.""

According to the American Heart Association, more than 78 million adults in the United States have high blood pressure, which is blood pressure higher than 140/90 mmHg.

Among these adults, about 9 percent have resistant hypertension, which means that even taking three or more medications to control their blood pressure, it remains higher than 140/90 mmHg.

"“It’s promising that we can see an effect from a single dose,” says researcher Leah Coles, PhD, a research fellow at the Baker IDI Heart and Diabetes Institute in Melbourne, Australia. “That effect might be even greater over the long term if they are drinking it day upon day.”

Researchers say that drop may seem small, but on a public health level a reduction like that would equate to a 10% reduction in deaths due to heart disease .

The study shows that within hours of drinking it, beet juice lowered systolic blood pressure (the top number in a blood pressure reading) by an average of 4-5 points among a small group of healthy men .

Dec. 14, 2012 -- Drinking a glass of beet juice may have an immediate impact on lowering blood pressure , according to a new study.

Beetroot Benefits

Previous studies have shown that beet juice, also known as beetroot juice, can lower blood pressure in a laboratory setting. But researchers say this is the first study to look at the effects of adding beet juice to a heathy person’s diet without making any other diet or lifestyle changes.

The results appear in Nutrition Journal.

In the study, 15 men and 15 women drank either 17.6 ounces of a beet juice beverage consisting of about three-fourths beet juice and one-fourth apple juice, or a placebo juice. They were then monitored for 24 hours. The same procedure was repeated two weeks later, with those who drank the placebo on the first round receiving beetroot juice on the second.

Among both men and women, the results showed a trend to lower systolic blood pressure six hours after drinking the beet juice.

But when researchers limited their analysis to men only, they found a significant reduction of about 4.7 points among those who drank the beetroot juice.

Previous studies have also suggested that beetroot’s blood-pressure-lowering effects may not be as strong in women.

In this case, Coles says it may be partially explained by the fact that the women in the study tended to be older, and many were on prescription medications, such as oral contraceptives.",1

FRIDAY, Dec. 7, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental antidepressant that targets the brain in a different way appears to both act fast and last long, researchers say.

The new drug -- called GLYX-13 -- is so far given in an intravenous form and was recently tested in patients who had not responded to other antidepressants. It began its work within hours and a single dose lasted about a week, Northwestern University researchers reported.

""We saw a robust, rapid-acting, long-lasting effect,"" said lead researcher Joseph Moskal, a research professor of biomedical engineering at Northwestern's McCormick School of Engineering and Applied Science and director of the school's Falk Center for Molecular Therapeutics. ""In addition, we have shown little or no side effects with our compound.""

One expert said the drug might prove a valuable tool against depression.

""It sounds like an exciting development,"" Dr. Bryan Bruno, acting chair of psychiatry at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City said. If it were a pill, the drug could change treatment for many patients, he added. ""Because it's so quick it would be a huge advantage over our current medications all of which take six to eight weeks for the full effect and at least three to four weeks to start working for most people,"" Bruno said.

Currently, the most popular drugs to treat depression are called selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors, or SSRIs. These include Prozac, Paxil, Zoloft and Lexapro. They work by improving levels of the hormone serotonin, which may be too low in people suffering from depression.

Although SSRIs are effective in many people, not all respond to the same drugs and some people don't respond well.

GLYX-13, the new drug, is still being studied and it isn't projected to be available before some time in 2016, Moskal said. Many unknowns remain about the drug, including its long-term effects, whether some people won't respond to it and the effects of stopping its use.

Moskal, however, said he is confident that this drug will be a breakthrough in treating depression. Given the results so far, he said, people won't need to take the drug every day, only once a week or less.

The GLYX-13 study is a phase 2 trial, which evaluates a drug's effectiveness while continuing to assess its safety.

The results were presented Thursday at the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology annual meeting in Hollywood, Fla. Findings from the team's animal research that led to the new method appeared online Dec. 3 in the journal Neuropsychopharmacology.

Moskal is the founder and chief scientific officer of the biotechnology firm Naurex Inc., which conducted the study. Northwestern University has licensed the intellectual property rights to certain therapeutics developed by Moskal to Naurex, according to a Northwestern news release.

The study received funding from the U.S. National Institutes of Health among others.

GLYX-13 targets parts of the brain linked to learning and memory. An advantage is that the drug doesn't have the side effects of other drugs that target these same areas, such as hallucinations and schizophrenia-like symptoms, the researchers noted.

Moskal's team developed a new way to target the brain's NMDA (N-methyl-D-aspartate) receptor to achieve these results. The clinical trial included about 120 patients, Moskal said. Patients were either given the drug or an inactive placebo.

Antidepressant effects of the drug were seen within 24 hours and lasted an average of seven days. The effect of the drug was substantially better than seen with other antidepressants, the researchers found. The drug was so well received by patients that many who were in the trial have called asking to be in any further trials, Moskal said.

A new trial that makes use of the drug in pill form is slated to get under way next year, Moskal noted.

Because the drug targets these areas of the brain it might also help people with other problems such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, anxiety and Alzheimer's disease, the researchers suggested.

For his part, Bruno cautioned that the long-term effects of the drug need to be studied before it can be used regularly in clinical practice.

Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

Breast cancer patients who double the length of time that they take a common medication can sharply reduce their risk of death, according to a new study that's predicted to influence medical practice.

The study involved an estrogen-blocking pill called tamoxifen, a standard therapy for the roughly two-thirds of breast cancer patients whose tumors are sensitive to estrogen. Taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one-third.

In the new study, women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for 10 years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another 29%, compared to women who stopped after five years.

In absolute terms, 12% of women on tamoxifen for 10 years died of breast cancer within five to 14 years after diagnosis, compared to 15% of those who stopped at five years.

Overall, women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half, compared with those who don't take it at all, says study co-author Richard Gray of the University of Oxford in the United Kingdom.

That's significant, given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide, says Gray, whose study was presented Wednesday at the annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium. Oxford funded the study, which included more than 6,800 women from 36 countries, While tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women, it appears to cure others, Gray says.

""This is a dream come true for women,"" says V. Craig Jordan, a researcher who led tamoxifen's development, but who wasn't involved in the new study. ""It's very exciting.""

Tamoxifen, which has been used for decades, is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs, which cost thousands of dollars a month. A generic version costs about $100 a month in the USA, according to Susan G. Komen for the Cure.

In the U.K., tamoxifen costs only $5 a month. In India, it's 2 cents a pill, says Jordan, scientific director at Georgetown's Lombardi Comprehensive Cancer Center.

Jordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients.

Younger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use, says Jennifer Litton, an assistant professor at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, who wasn't involved in the study.

Tamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause, Litton says.

Doctors may not want to change the care of older patients, however, she says. That's because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies, called aromatase inhibitors, or AIs. These drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen, although they don't work before menopause, Litton says.

Because the study didn't include AIs, doctors can't say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who've taken them, Litton says. Other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus 10 years of AIs, although these results won't be out for several years.

Gray noted that tamoxifen has risks. In his study, doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer, which affects the uterine lining, to about 3%. However, because this cancer is very treatable, death rates were low: 0.4% of those on tamoxifen for 10 years died of endometrial cancer, compared to 0.2% of those taking it for five years.

Doctors saw no increase in strokes, which has long been a concern with tamoxifen, Gray says.

Breast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results.

Some women will be glad to have another treament option, says breast cancer survivor Lillie Shockney, 59, administrative director of the Johns Hopkins Cancer Survivorhip Program in Baltimore.

""Patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy, because they feel like now they aren't doing anything,"" says Shockney, 59. ""The opportunity to 'do something' might be appealing, despite the side effects.""

Shockney says she'd like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences, such as weight loss. ""If someone lost 40 pounds, would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen?"" Shockney asks.

Some patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects, says Boston breast cancer survivor Alicia Staley.

Studies show that only 80% of women take tamoxifen for five years, Litton says. Some switch to an AI, although these drugs can also cause problems, such as joint pain and osteoporosis.

Staley say she tamoxifen gave her ""many, many side effects,"" including severe hot flashes. ""Dry eyes, joint pain, weight gain — you name it, I had it,"" she says.

After 2½ years, Staley and her doctor stopped the drug ""to regain a measure of quality of life.""

For Shockney, tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage, causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful.

Patients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship, she says.

""If we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for 10 years, by golly, we better get the partners involved,"" Shockney says.

Yet Shockney says her husband of nearly 35 years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive.

""If someone said to my husband, 'I know this has been a rough road for you, and a big impact on your sex life, but if she stays on it another five years. it could affect her survival,' he would have said, 'Please, please, take the pill.' """,1
"In a new study from Italy, researchers were able to identify patients with colorectal cancer with an accuracy of over 75% by analyzing samples of their breath.

Dec. 5, 2012 -- A breath test similar to the one used to determine when a driver has had too much to drink shows promise as a screening tool for cancer .

Cancer Breath Test

Similar research is under way to develop breathalyzer-like devices to detect lung, breast, prostate, and other cancers.

Cleveland Clinic pulmonologist Peter Mazzone, MD, who is conducting lung cancer studies, says a breath test for cancer may be a reality in as little as five years if all goes well.

“But we are still in the research phase, and there is still the possibility that this technology will never prove clinically useful,” he says. “There is still quite a bit of work to be done.”

Mazzone says the breath functions in the body in much the same way that the exhaust system functions in a car, and what comes out gives a sense of how things are working inside.

A person’s breath contains a variety of chemical compounds, and it has long been recognized that certain illnesses can affect how the breath smells.

People with poorly controlled diabetes, for example, may have breath that smells fruity due to an overproduction of chemicals called ketones; people with kidney or liver failure can have fishy breath.

The lung cancer device Mazzone is testing, called an ""electronic nose"" sensor, changes color based on the chemicals in the breath.",1

NASHVILLE -- Sick with depression, Harriet Bruce spent her days lying in bed for months at a time.

Pills didn't work. Neither did psychotherapy.

Then she agreed to a transcranial magnetic stimulation. The new treatment pushes powerful magnetic currents into the front of the brain, the part that controls emotions.

These days, Bruce awakens before her alarm goes off and dives into projects, including monster tasks she once dreaded.

""I have a room in my house in which I had stacked boxes from when we moved 10 years ago that I wanted to get to, but I couldn't do it,"" the Centerville woman said. ""But I've been working on that.""

Transcranial magnetic stimulation, once considered an experimental treatment for depression, is gaining acceptance since it came on the market four years ago. Beginning Saturday, Medicare will cover the treatments when other therapies have failed. This week, specialty insurance administrator Magellan Behavioral Health Inc. issued medical necessity guidelines for TMS treatment and will provide coverage effective Jan. 1.

Doctors who use the NeuroStar TMS Therapy system say treatments are more effective than medications with far fewer side effects. It's an alternative to electroconvulsive therapy — shock treatments — for patients who have not responded to drugs or psychotherapy. But TMS is expensive. It can cost as much as $400 for a 37-minute session and require multiple treatments. The total bill can range between $8,000 and $12,000.

The cost, however, is less than an extended hospital stay.

""We had several patients who were headed toward the hospital, who had this treatment and were able to avoid that,"" said Dr. Scott West, a psychiatrist who pioneered the treatment in Nashville 2 and one-half years ago.

The NeuroStar system resembles a dentist's chair. A patient sits in the chair while a magnetic pulse emitter transmits energy from a levered arm — a process similar to undergoing dental X-rays. The device makes a clicking noise while delivering the magnetic pulses.

""When this large magnet pulses repetitively, it causes an electromagnetic field which then passes through the skull and stimulates the brain tissue itself,"" said West, explaining a cascading effect that results in the interior nerve fibers connecting better.

Dr. Michelle Cochran, purchased her TMS system about 18 months ago. The devices cost around $100,000, Cochran said, who has treated 45 patients with the therapy.

""Most people are not scared of it,"" she said. ""It sounds sort of creepy and weird when you think about it, but for the most part, it is safer in general than taking a medicine. You've got less seizure risk than taking a medicine. You've got less side effects than taking a medicine.""

Both Cochran and West cite high patient response rates. A clinical trial funded by the National Institutes of Health revealed a ""significant effect of treatment"" when patients received TMS treatment. It compared outcomes of patients who actually received the magnetic pulses against patients in a ""sham"" group, who sat down in the treatment chair for fake sessions.

Depressed patients who received the real TMS treatment had remission rates four times higher than those in the sham group.

However, insurers, including UnitedHealthcare and BlueCross BlueShield of Tennessee, remain reluctant to embrace the treatment. UnitedHealthcare's medical policy for TMS says it is unproven for treating depression.

""Generally speaking, just because a device, procedure or medication has been approved or is deemed to be safe by some entities does not mean that it is automatically covered,"" BlueCross BlueShield spokeswoman Kelly Allen said. ""Quality and safety are our first priority in setting our medical policy, but those have to be balanced with affordability.""

Cochran does not accept Medicare and has chosen to be an out-of-network provider. West is a Medicare provider.

Said West: ""Typically, when Medicare starts to cover something the excuse of experimental and investigational is no longer valid.""",1

WEDNESDAY, Nov. 28, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Patients with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to suffer hip dislocation after hip replacement surgery than those with osteoarthritis, a new study says.

In addition, rheumatoid arthritis patients have a higher infection risk after total knee replacement than osteoarthritis patients, the study authors found.

Rheumatoid arthritis, which is felt throughout the whole body, is caused when a person's immune system attacks his or her own tissues. Osteoarthritis, which is usually felt only in the joints, is caused by wear and tear on the body.

For the study, the investigators analyzed the findings of 40 studies published between January 1990 and December 2011. The studies included arthritis patients aged 18 or older who had hip or knee replacements.

The findings are published in the Nov. 28 online edition of Arthritis & Rheumatism.

""Joint arthroplasty is successful in relieving the pain and disability caused by hip or knee arthritis,"" study author Dr. Bheeshma Ravi, from the University of Toronto and Women's College Research Institute, said in a journal news release. ""While complication rates are low, there are some cases with serious consequences that include infection, joint dislocation, blood clots and even death.""

The study team found no differences between the two groups of arthritis patients in rates of follow-up surgery, or 90-day blood clot or death risk.

Rheumatoid arthritis affects about 1.3 million people in the United States, while osteoarthritis affects 27 million Americans aged 25 and older, according to the American College of Rheumatology.

"Nov. 18, 2012 -- Researchers say they've been able to use nanoparticles to stop multiple sclerosis (MS) in mice that are bred to have the disease.

The particles are about 200 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair. They are made from the same material that's used to create dissolving stitches.

When researchers attach specific proteins to the particles, they say they're able to teach the body not to attack its own tissues.

If the approach succeeds in human studies, it may one day lead to more targeted treatments not only for multiple sclerosis but also for other kinds of autoimmune disorders, including type 1 diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis.

“This technology could be very effective,” says Timothy Coetzee, PhD, chief research officer for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society.

What remains to be seen is whether the researchers have picked the right proteins that might turn off the disease in humans, he says.

“Will these peptides actually induce tolerance in people? We just don’t know. It’s rational, but we won’t know until we get it into people,” says Coetzee, who was not involved in the research.

The research is published in the journal Nature Biotechnology. The study was funded by grants from the National Institutes of Health, the Myelin Repair Foundation, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, and the Australian government.",1
"Researchers trying to find a way to treat multiple sclerosis think they’ve come up with an approach that could not only help patients with MS, but those with a range of so-called autoimmune diseases, from type-1 diabetes to psoriasis, and perhaps even food allergies.

So far it’s only worked in mice, but it has worked especially well. And while mice are different from humans in many ways, their immune systems are quite similar.

“If this works, it is going to be absolutely fantastic,” said Bill Heetderks, who directs outside research at the National Institute of Biomedical Imaging and Bioengineering, part of the National Institutes of Health, which helped pay for the research. “Even if it doesn’t work, it’s going to be another step down the road.”

In autoimmune disease, the body’s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue. In MS, it’s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves; in type-1 or juvenile diabetes it’s cells in the pancreas that make insulin; in rheumatoid arthritis it’s tissue in the joint.

Currently, the main treatment is to suppress the immune system, an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer. The new treatment re-educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks.

The approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body. They’re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking, the researchers report in Sunday’s issue of the journal Nature Biotechnology.

Stephen Miller of the Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine in Chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating MS. When normal cells die naturally through a self-destruction process called apoptosis, immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess.

The macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground-up bits of cells to other immune cells called T-cells. It’s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the T-cells with the body’s normal cells. Then T-cells know not to attack healthy cells.

Miller’s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re-educate the T-cells. They have been attaching bits of the myelin that T-cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from MS patients that were self-destructing, then infusing the concoction back into MS patients.

The idea would be to “introduce” the myelin to the T-cells at the same time they were “meeting” the healthy tissue, and educate them to leave the myelin alone.

So far the team has only shown the process is safe – a phase 1 clinical trial. But Miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients’ immune systems. However, it was hideously expensive. “It cost probably about a million dollars to treat 10 patients using live cells,” he said.

Obviously, the researchers needed something cheaper. Miller got together with Lonnie Shea, a professor of chemical and biological engineering at Northwestern. They substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self-destructing cells.

These new nanoparticles stopped the course of a MS-like disease in mice, the researchers found. But polystyrene is no good to use in people. It doesn’t break down and contains a compound, styrene, that may cause cancer.

Shea had another possibility, called poly(lactide-co-glycolide) or PLG for short. “It turns out this is an FDA approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures,” said Miller.

“There is nothing rare or exotic or strange here,” said NIBIB’s Heetderks. The particles are easy to produce, he said.

This worked just as well in mice. It only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of PLG. When infused into a vein, they’re carried by the blood right to the spleen, where the nanoparticles “meet” the T-cells.

If the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first MS-like attack, the attacks stopped. The effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice, Miller said.

What’s great about the approach, Miller says, is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease. For diabetes, little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles. For a food allergy, the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached. “You can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to,” he said.

One shortcoming is that scientists don’t always know what’s causing an autoimmune disease. “We know that in rheumatoid arthritis, your joints get attacked, but what we don’t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked. We really need to know that before we can apply this therapy,” Miller said.

Now the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people. They’re in discussions with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation to test it in people with type-1 diabetes, and the Myelin Repair Foundation to test it in MS patients, Miller said. They may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment, something that would be years away.

Mice don’t live very long, and it’s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments. But the T-cells that are re-educated usually live for a long time in the body, and have long memories, Miller said.

It’s also clear the approach would not repair any damage already done by the disease, so the best candidates would be patients having their very first symptoms. But it might be possible down the road to combine the nanoparticle treatment with another treatment to replace the damaged tissue in more advanced patients, Miller said.

Most doctors say meditation can’t hurt you, but now there’s reassuring evidence that it may help you as well when it comes to warding off disease.

Previous studies have linked better health outcomes among heart patients who practiced meditation compared to those who did not, but none of those trials could definitively credit the brain-focusing program with the better health results. In the latest trial to address those limitations, however, meditation does appear to have an effect on reducing heart attack, stroke and even early death from heart disease, at least among African-Americans.

MORE: Losing Focus? Studies Say Meditation May Help

“The main finding [of our research] is that, added on top of usual medical care, intervention with a mind-body technique — transcendental meditation — can have a major effect on cardiovascular events,” says Robert Schneider, lead author on the study published in Circulation: Cardiovascular Quality and Outcomes and a professor at the Maharishi University of Management, an institution in Iowa that was founded by the creator of transcendental meditation.

He and his colleagues followed 201 African American men and women, who are at higher risk of heart disease than whites, but who also had addition reason to worry about heart attacks and strokes since they were also diagnosed with coronary heart disease. The participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart-friendly diet and exercise, or to attend a transcendental meditation program. Transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward, or resting while remaining alert. All of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well, including appropriate medication.

After roughly five years of follow-up, the researchers found a 48% reduction in the overall risk of heart attack, stroke, and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group. The meditating group enjoyed an average drop of 4.9 mm Hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger. “It’s like discovering a whole new class of medications,” Schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients’ health.

But while the magnitude of those results is remarkable, the study involved a relatively small number of participants, and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk. On the surface, it’s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better; anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge, triggering spikes in heart-harming stress hormones like cortisol.

But many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount. In the past, these benefits have been hard to test scientifically, largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed. Practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation, leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical. In fact, in 2005, more than 500 brain researchers signed a petition (albeit an unsuccessful one) to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the Buddhist spiritual icon, the Dalai Lama, at a major conference organized by the Society for Neuroscience.

MORE: Mind Over Matter: Can Zen Meditation Help You Forget About Pain?

The great lengths to which the researchers of the Circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous, however, should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics. The scientists adjusted for the effects of weight, smoking behavior, and diet, all of which can influence heart attack, stroke and early heart death rates. And while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study, they did so at similar rates, making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either.

While the findings aren’t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care, the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that’s an improvement over the advice that “it can’t hurt to try.”

"Nov. 12, 2012 -- A drug used outside the U.S. to treat osteoporosis may not only lessen the everyday pain associated with knee osteoarthritis, but may even slow down the progression of osteoarthritis, researchers say.

The drug is called strontium ranelate.

In a three-year study of more than 1,300 people with knee osteoarthritis, digital X-rays revealed substantially less loss of cartilage in the joint space in those who took strontium ranelate every day compared with people who took a placebo daily.

In people with osteoarthritis, the cartilage in a joint wears away in some areas. The function of cartilage is to reduce friction in the joints and serve as a ""shock absorber."" The wearing away of cartilage leads to pain and other symptoms.

Nearly one in 100 people have evidence of knee osteoarthritis on an X-ray. And nearly 19% of women and 14% of men age 45 and older have joint pain, stiffness, and other symptoms of knee osteoarthritis, according to a large 2007 study.

"The ancient art of applying suction cups to the body has gotten a boost from several new studies that show it helps relieve a variety of painful conditions. But scientists say larger, more rigorous studies are needed.

In fire cupping, burning cotton is placed inside a glass cup, which creates a vacuum as it cools.

Cupping, as the practice is called, was performed traditionally in China and other countries, and is now available from acupuncturists, and some chiropractors and massage therapists in the U.S. In the traditional method, called fire cupping, a ball of burning cotton is briefly placed inside a glass cup to heat the air inside, which then creates a partial vacuum as it cools. Newer-style plastic or silicone cups have valves that attach to hand pumps used to create suction.

Until recently, there was scant published evidence in favor of cupping for pain relief. Over the past three years, a handful of new studies have shown it helps relieve back, neck, carpal tunnel and knee pain.

There are a number of theories on how cupping may work to relieve pain. A widely held one is that suction on the skin ""increases blood flow to the area and creates a mild immune response,"" says Kathleen Lumiere, an assistant professor of acupuncture and oriental medicine at Bastyr University in Kenmore, Wash. It also helps release fascia, connective tissue that can pull on muscles causing pain or limited motion, clinicians say.

Typically cups are on for up to 20 minutes and leave a temporary reddish mark that looks ""like rare roast beef,"" says Brian K. Nathanson, a Norwalk, Conn., chiropractor who has been doing cupping for about five years.

Some clinicians slide the cups on the body, using them as massage tools in a technique sometimes called running cupping. ""People who love deep-tissue massage love cupping,"" says Gabrielle Francis, a Manhattan chiropractor and acupuncturist who does both static cupping and running cupping. Both can cause mild discomfort in some patients, clinicians say.

Cupping is an ancient healing art that was traditionally practiced in China, the Middle East and other countries. Corbis

The intrepid can opt for ""wet cupping,"" in which the skin is punctured with a lancet before the cups are applied. The technique, which draws out a small quantity of blood, can have a powerful effect—particularly on areas where you can feel a hard lump of knotted muscles, says Kristine Tohtz, a Chicago chiropractor and acupuncturist who does wet and dry cupping.

Cost of cupping varies widely, from $40 to $100 or more for a half-hour session. It shouldn't be done on pregnant women, people with heart conditions or people with bleeding disorders, clinicians say. Caution should be used if a person has thin skin that might tear easily.

In a study of people with neck pain caused by computer use, ""cupping therapy was effective in reducing pain,"" says Tae-Hun Kim, a researcher at the Korea Institute of Oriental Medicine in Daejeon, South Korea. The 40-person study, published online in September in the Journal of Occupational Health, found that six cupping sessions over two weeks was more effective on average in relieving pain than a heating pad—and the benefit lasted a month after treatment ended.

But, says Romy Lauche, a scientist at the University of Duisburg-Essen in Essen, Germany, ""the studies are very preliminary. We cannot say it has proven its efficacy.""

Dr. Lauche co-authored a 50-person study published last year that found a single wet-cupping treatment on average significantly reduced chronic neck pain three days after the treatment, compared with a control group that had no treatment. Location of the cups varied with each patient but typically was on the trapezius muscle, which spans the neck, shoulders and upper back. In unpublished results, she adds, scientists found the pain relief lasted for months.

In a 40-person German study published in October, cupping therapy significantly relieved knee arthritis pain compared with patients who received no treatment. But the study's lack of a control group treated with a sham technique ""raises questions of whether it is cupping that is really working or if it has a placebo effect,"" says David Felson, who directs an arthritis research program at Boston University School of Medicine.

Dr. Lauche agrees that lack of a placebo control is a flaw in the studies. A new study, currently ongoing for fibromyalgia pain, is testing cupping against a sham cup that attaches with adhesive and provides minimal suction, she says.

"Nov. 5, 2012 (Los Angeles) -- An IV infusion of ""good"" HDL cholesterol seems to rapidly remove cholesterol out of plaque-clogged arteries following a heart attack, a small, early study suggests.

The goal of the new treatment is to reduce the high risk of a second heart attack in people who have had a heart attack.

In the year after a heart attack, about 12% of people have a second heart attack or stroke. And half of them happen in the first month, says researcher Andreas Gille, MD, PhD. Gille is head of clinical and translational science strategy at CSL Limited (which funded the study) in Parkville, Australia.

Standard heart attack medications, such as aspirin and anti-clotting drugs, prevent clotting but don’t eliminate an underlying factor: cholesterol that has built up on artery walls, he says.

HDL removes cholesterol from artery walls, but current HDL-boosting drugs, such as niacin and fibrates, take years to work, according to Gille.",1
"LOS ANGELES (Reuters) - Amgen Inc’s experimental drug AMG145 reduced levels of bad cholesterol by as much as 55 percent in combination with statin drugs in patients genetically predisposed to high cholesterol, according to data from a midstage trial presented on Monday.

The new drug, given by injection every four weeks, is part of a promising new class of biotech medicines known as PCSK9 inhibitors designed to target a protein that prevents the body from removing artery blocking LDL cholesterol from the bloodstream.

Statins, such as Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor, work by preventing the liver from making cholesterol.

The Phase II trial found that after 12 weeks, patients treated with a low dose of AMG145 had a 43 percent reduction in LDL, while those given a higher dose had a drop of 55 percent. Patients treated with a placebo saw a 1 percent increase in LDL cholesterol.

The trial, presented here at the annual scientific meeting of the American Heart Association, included 168 patients with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia, in which a defective gene inherited from one parent impairs the ability to properly metabolize LDL. The disorder is estimated to affect about one in 500 people and causes extremely high cholesterol.

The most common side effects seen in the trial were injection-site reactions, cold-like symptoms and headache.

AMG145, along with other PCSK9 inhibitors being developed by companies like Pfizer, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals Inc in partnership with Sanofi and Roche, is a man-made antibody.",1

MONDAY, Nov. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental drug may help patients who can't tolerate statins lower their cholesterol, a new Australian study suggests.

The 12-week, phase 2 clinical trial was conducted at 33 international sites and included adults who suffered muscle problems when taking statins, a class of cholesterol-lowering drugs that includes Crestor and Lipitor. They received injections of a placebo or different doses of AMG145, which is a human monoclonal antibody.

Human monoclonal antibodies are naturally occurring human antibodies that are genetically altered in a laboratory, cloned in large numbers and introduced into the patient to target disease sites.

The patients who received AMG145 had 41 percent to 63 percent reductions in ""bad"" (LDL) cholesterol and did not experience significant muscle-related side effects, said study leader Dr. David Sullivan, of the Royal Prince Alfred Hospital in Australia, and colleagues.

The reductions in LDL cholesterol seen in these patients were comparable to those that occur in patients taking the highest doses of the most effective statins, the researchers added.

One expert found the results intriguing.

""The most interesting aspect of this study is use of a novel approach using monoclonal antibodies -- a subtype of antibodies -- in the management of elevated LDL cholesterol,"" said Dr. Kenneth Ong, acting chief of cardiology at the Brooklyn Hospital Center.

""In this phase 2 study, the results are certainly impressive and warrant further investigation,"" Ong said. ""Of note is the reduction in the number of myalgias (muscle pains) for patients compared to the number of myalgias experienced by people taking statins. If larger trials and longer durations of observation confirm these initial findings, many patients whose LDL cholesterol are otherwise untreated or under-treated could benefit.""

Another expert agreed.

""For those patients with elevated LDL who are intolerant to statins, this provides a viable option,"" said Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. More trials need to be done of this unique treatment, she added.

The study was published online Nov. 5 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, to coincide with a planned presentation at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Los Angeles.

"Oct. 29, 2012 -- Early, intensive autism treatment improves children's brain development, a new study shows.

The treatment, dubbed Early Start Denver Model or ESDM, offers a child 20 hours a week of one-on-one treatment with a trained therapist. It also calls for many more hours of the treatment, in the form of structured play, with a parent trained in the technique.

By age 4, children given the treatment had higher IQ scores, more adaptive behavior, better coordination, and a less severe autism diagnosis than kids given the standard autism treatments offered in their communities. But that's not all, researchers Geraldine Dawson, PhD, and colleagues report.

""We jump-started and improved the responses of children's brains to social information,"" says Dawson, professor of psychiatry at the University of North Carolina and chief science officer at Autism Speaks.

Normal child development depends on interactions with parents and other people. Without such interactions, language and social skills do not develop.

As measured by an electroencephalogram (EEG), small children's brains show a specific pattern of activity when they look at a picture of a human face. This doesn't happen when they look at pictures of inanimate objects.

Just the reverse happens in children with autism. Their brains light up when they look at pictures of objects, but not when they look at faces. This changed dramatically in the children treated with ESDM.

""The [brains of] children who received the ESDM looked virtually identical to typical 4-year-olds,"" Dawson says. ""The children that received the interventions normal in their communities continued to show the reversed pattern.""",1
"Oct. 26, 2012 -- Hypnosis is an effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes and night sweats, new research finds. The alternative therapy reduced hot flashes by as much as 74% in the study conducted by researchers at Baylor University’s Mind-Body Medicine Research Laboratory and funded by the National Institutes of Health. Only hormone therapy, which many women can’t take or want to avoid, is more effective for treating the most common symptom of menopause, says researcher Gary R. Elkins, PhD. “If you compare this treatment with off-label use of antidepressants or other non-hormonal therapies, it works as well or better,” he says.

Hot Flashes, Night Sweats Hot flashes are a sudden rush of heat, followed by facial flushing and sweating, often followed by chills and clamminess. The progression is familiar to most women of a certain age. Hot flashes and night sweats are the most common symptoms of menopause, affecting some 80% of women. They are linked to declining estrogen levels, but it remains unclear just why the sudden lack of estrogen sends the body into thermal mayhem, and why some women are more affected than others. Hormone therapy is a very effective treatment for menopause-related hot flashes, but concerns about risks have limited its use among women. “There is certainly a need for non-pharmacologic treatments for hot flashes and night sweats,” says North American Menopause Society (NAMS) Executive Director Margery Gass, MD.",1
"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel-based Neuronix, which has developed a non-invasive medical device to help to treat Alzheimer’s disease, expects the system to be approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in late 2014.

Neuronix CEO Eyal Baror poses for a photo next to a newly-developed device to treat Alzheimer's disease at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center near Tel Aviv October 24, 2012. REUTERS/Nir Elias

The device, which combines electromagnetic stimulation with computer-based cognitive training, is already approved for use in Europe, Israel and several Asian countries such as Singapore.

“You stimulate the brain on a biological level as well as on a cognitive level,” Neuronix CEO Eyal Baror told Reuters, saying this double approach created longer-lasting benefits.

The device, which consists of a chair containing an electronic system and software in the back and a coil placed at the head, has been tested on mild to moderate Alzheimer’s patients who suffer from dementia but are not totally dependent.

The system is in trials at Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Patients are treated for one hour a day, five days a week over six weeks.

“We see improvement lasting for 9-12 months and the good thing is that patients can return and undergo treatment again,” Baror said. “If out of 10 years the patients have left to live we can keep them at home in a relatively mild state of the disease for three, four, five years, it’s a lot.”

According to Alvaro Pascual-Leone, director of the hospital’s Berenson-Allen Centre for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, brain stimulation - or transcranial magnetic stimulation - involves a very low current applied to a specific part of the brain and is approved by the FDA for treatment of a variety of ailments and diagnostic applications.

“The application in Alzheimer’s disease and in combination with cognitive training is novel,” Pascual-Leono said in a phone interview from Boston.

About 20 percent of patients experience a mild headache but there are no long-term negative effects, he said.

Pascual-Leone, who is principal investigator in the Harvard trial, said that of 12 patients in the study, six received the real treatment and all showed cognitive improvement. Their improvement was significantly more than the average seen in patients taking just medication, he said.

The study’s results will be submitted for publication in the coming weeks and a follow-up study on 30 patients is planned.

Neuronix received European approval several months ago and has installations in the UK and Germany. In Israel, a few dozen patients are being treated with the device.

The U.S. trials are expected to run till the end of 2013. Neuronix is also running a trial in Israel for pre-Alzheimer’s patients.

The company expects to sell half a dozen systems in the second half of 2012 and three dozen in 2013. In Israel, the treatment costs $6,000.

“Our target for becoming profitable is in parallel to entering the U.S. market around 2015,” Baror said.

Neuronix has raised $8 million from private individuals as well as in grants from the Israeli Chief Scientist’s Office and is exploring options to raise more money in the coming year, including the possibility of going public.",0

MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A prescription medication originally developed to treat epilepsy may help obese adults shed weight when combined with routine nutritional counseling, researchers say.

Patients who took 400 milligrams of the anti-seizure drug zonisamide daily for a year lost nearly 7.5 pounds more on average than those assigned to dietaryand lifestyle changes alone, the new study found. But they also suffered more side effects than patients not taking the medication.

""The question was to see if more weight loss could be achieved if we provided decent quality lifestyle intervention, mostly dietary counseling, along with this medication,"" said study lead author Dr. Kishore Gadde, director of the Obesity Clinical Trials Program at Duke University Medical Center in Durham, N.C.

""And the answer was yes,"" Gadde said.

The research, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health, appears online Oct. 15 in the journal Archives of Internal Medicine.

For obese men and women who can't control their weight through diet and lifestyle changes, nonsurgical options are limited, the study authors noted. Just a few prescription medications are approved in the United States for long-term treatment of obesity, including orlistat (brand name Xenical) and lorcaserin hydrochloride (Belviq).

Gadde and colleagues set out to follow up on a 16-week investigation they conducted in 2003 that had indicated that zonisamide (Zonegran) at a dosage of 400 milligrams a day might offer an alternative.

Between 2006 and 2011 the study team randomly assigned more than 200 obese men and women to one of three groups. One group took 200 milligrams of zonisamide daily, another got 400 mg of zonisamide daily and one received a dummy pill. The participants' average age was 43, and their average body-mass index (BMI) was nearly 38. BMI is a calculation of body fat based on height and weight, and a BMI of more than 30 is considered obese. None had diabetes.

All study participants followed their treatment plan for one year. During this time, they all also received monthly individualized nutritional counseling, which Gadde described as ""not intensive,"" to help them reduce their overall caloric intake.

Those on the higher-dose zonisamide protocol fared the best in terms of overall weight loss, while the lower-dose regimen was not much more effective than the placebo.

Although nearly 55 percent of those on the higher-dose medication shed 5 percent or more of their pre-study weight, that figure was 34 percent among the lower-dose group and 31 percent among the non-medication participants.

But patients in both drug groups faced a higher risk for side effects, including diarrhea, headache, fatigue, nausea/vomiting, concentration and memory difficulties, anxiety, and depression-related symptoms.

The authors said such side effects were typically ""mild."" They concluded that the higher-dose zonisamide showed promise as a weight-loss aid, but advised clinicians to carefully weigh the pros and cons on a patient-by-patient basis.

""There's no medicine that is a panacea for obesity,"" cautioned Gadde. ""The important thing to keep in mind is that although we diagnose obesity on the basis of a mathematical formula -- a BMI of 30 and up -- the basis for obesity may differ from one individual to another.""

Psychological factors or lifestyle factors may play a role, he said. ""But for about a third [of patients], biological issues are at play, such as not easily experiencing satiety signals from the gut to the brain, which senses what your energy intake has been,"" he said. ""And for those people, medication can help.""

Lona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center at Dallas, agreed.

Caution is vital when using any drug that has been approved for one condition for another, Sandon said.

""But for many people, this kind of drug might absolutely be of great help, by doing something that helps the regulation of these appetite hormones and the regulatory pathway,"" she said.

The most common treatment for urinary incontinence is a daily dose of an anticholinergic medicine that alters the action of certain nerves. Botox injections are also used, often in cases where the medicine does not work.

Now a placebo-controlled study has found that the treatments are equally useful in reducing the frequency of episodes of incontinence, but vary in side effects and long-term effectiveness.

Researchers randomly assigned 241 women with urinary incontinence to daily medicine and a placebo injection, or a Botox injection and a daily placebo pill.

The scientists, writing online on Oct. 4 in The New England Journal of Medicine, found that both treatments significantly reduced incontinence episodes. Dry mouth was much more common in those who took the medicine; urinary infections and incomplete emptying of the bladder were more common in those given Botox. Significantly, those who took Botox were more likely to have their symptoms completely disappear.

The medicine has to be taken daily, while Botox is given in a single injection that is effective for about 6 to 12 months.

“These are both effective treatments,” said the lead author, Dr. Anthony G. Visco, an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Duke. “This gives patients the information to make an informed decision. Both are reasonable options.”",1

MONDAY, Oct. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A large amount of beta amyloid, or ""plaques,"" in the brain may trigger more significant memory loss in healthy older people than the genetic risk factor associated with Alzheimer's disease, known as the APOE ɛ4 allele, according to new research from Australia.

""Our finding that brain-plaque-related memory decline can occur while people still have normal memory and thinking shows that these plaque-related brain changes can be detected and measured while older people are still healthy,"" said study author Yen Ying Lim, of the University of Melbourne. ""This provides an enormous opportunity for understanding the development of early Alzheimer's disease and even a sound basis for the assessment of plaque-targeting therapies.""

The researchers had nearly 150 older adults with no thinking or memory problems undergo a PET brain scan. The participants, who were an average age of 76, also were tested for the APOE gene.

The group's brain function was monitored for 18 months using computer-based tests, card games and having the participants memorize word lists.

The study results are published in the Oct. 16 issue of the journal Neurology.

Over the course of the study, the people who began with more brain plaques had up to 20 percent greater decline on the computer-based assessments of memory than the people who had fewer brain plaques.

The researchers also found the participants who carried the APOE gene had greater memory loss than those who did not have this genetic risk factor. They noted, however, that carrying the gene did not affect memory decline associated with the plaques.

""Our results show that plaques may be a more important factor in determining which people are at greater risk for cognitive impairment or other memory diseases such as Alzheimer's disease,"" Lim said in a journal news release. ""Unfortunately, testing for the APOE genotype is easier and much less costly than conducting amyloid imaging.""

Although the researchers discovered an association between plaques and increased memory loss, they did not prove a cause-and-effect relationship.

"A widely anticipated study suggests that hormone therapy started soon after menopause can ease depression, anxiety, hot flashes and other adverse symptoms that many women face, without increasing risks for cardiovascular disease.

There was no increase in breast cancer, stroke, heart attack or blood clots, but the study's researchers said the sample size was too small and the study time too short to draw firm conclusions.

The preliminary findings, presented Wednesday at a conference of the North American Menopause Society in Orlando, Fla., were in starkcontrast to those of the Women's Health Initiative. That much larger, government-funded study of hormone therapy was halted in 2002 because the risks of heart disease and stroke seemed to outweigh the benefits.

Those findings had sparked concern among women who turn to hormone therapy to alleviate the symptoms of menopause. The women in the WHI were older—on average 63 years old—and largely a decade or more past menopause, and critics suggested women closer to menopause might get more benefit with less harm. Nevertheless, use of estrogen and progesterone in the U.S. dropped by more than half between 2001 and 2009, according to IMS Health, a health-care technology and information company.

The new study ""will be reassuring to many people who were anxious about using estrogen for short-term therapy, particularly health-care providers who were nervous about their patients taking this,"" said Mary Jane Minkin, a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Yale University School of Medicine, one of the study's eight sites.

The trial, known as Keeps, for Kronos Early Estrogen Prevention Study, was funded by the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a nonprofit organization in Phoenix that conducts research on age-related diseases.

The four-year randomized, placebo-controlled trial enrolled 727 women aged 42 to 58 who were within three years of the onset of menopause. They received either a low-dose estrogen pill (one made with horse estrogen) or a skin patch (one with estradiol, made from plants but closer to what women's bodies make) or a placebo.

Women on estrogen also took a natural progesterone; the WHI used a synthetic form.

Neither type of estrogen had any significant impact on blood pressure, coronary calcium levels or atherosclerosis, as measured by ultrasounds of the carotid artery—key markers of cardiovascular health. Researchers speculated that was because the women were generally healthy and yet at an age where such problems are rare.

Women taking estrogen in pill form had an increase in HDL or ""good"" cholesterol, and a decrease in LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol, but an increase in triglycerides. Women on the patch had an improvement in insulin sensitivity, making them less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes.

Women on both forms of estrogen reported fewer hot flashes, night sweats and mood swings, as well as an improvement in bone density.

A second branch of the study, funded by the National Institute of Aging, found that estrogen in pill form, but not the patch, improved symptoms of depression, anxiety and tension, without causing memory or cognitive ability, which the WHI had found in older women.

Researchers said those findings underscored the need for women and their doctors to make individual decisions about whether to go on hormone therapy and if so, which kind.

""A woman who has low HDL cholesterol and borderline high LDL and has some mood symptoms, might find some advantages on the oral estrogen, whereas a woman who has [high risk for Type 2 diabetes], some excess weight, might benefit from the [skin patch] form,"" said JoAnn Manson, chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and one of the lead Keeps researchers. The researchers , who haven't yet submitted the findings for publication, plan more analysis on the impact of hormone therapy on breast density They also say they hope to continue monitoring the participants for any future effects on heart disease, cancer or cognitive function-whether they continue to take hormones or not.

Margery Gass, executive director of the menopause society, and who wasn't involved in Keeps, said it confirmed her group's view on hormone therapy: ""There seems to be very small risks for healthy women at menopause."" But, ""there is no strong evidence that women should be taking it long-term.""

"A new, detailed mammography exam catches more cancers while causing fewer false alarms, according to the company that sells it. The downside, some physicians say, is that it costs more and delivers twice as much radiation as traditional mammograms.

Tomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography, has been available in the U.S. since February from Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass. In just a few months, radiologists say they are finding cancers they would have missed with the standard exam.

Others, though, urge caution. ""We really have to wait for the scientific evidence,"" says Barbara Monsees, who heads the American College of Radiology's breast-imaging commission, adding that the technology looks ""promising.""

Many digital mammogram centers are increasingly offering the option of paying a supplement out of pocket for a 3-D image. Standard mammograms miss 5% to 15% of tumors, in part because small ones can be hidden behind tissue. We discuss with Robert Cascella, CEO of Hologic, which manufactures a 3-D mammography machine. Photo: Hologic.

A study of some 25,000 women, now under way by an international team of researchers and partially funded by Hologic, is examining whether 3-D mammography finds more cancers. Preliminary results, presented at a scientific meeting in November, showed a 47% increase in cancer detection, but no conclusion can be drawn until the full results are published in a peer-reviewed journal, says Dr. Monsees.

The American Cancer Society recommends women get annual mammograms starting at 40 years old. A 3-D mammography machine is similar those used for standard 2-D mammography, but instead of taking just top and side pictures of each breast, the X-ray arm of a 3-D machine moves in an arc and collects detailed data used to create 50 or 60 razor-thin slices for each view. The 3-D scans show what breast tissue looks like at various depths.

Radiologists say they can now see tumors that would have been obscured by surrounding tissue. ""I think we're going to find more cancers at an earlier stage"" says Liane Philpotts, chief of breast imaging at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., adding that one recent tumor, difficult to see on a standard exam, ""jumped right out at us"" on a 3-D scan.

The benefit is particularly noticeable in women with dense breasts, in which tumors can be hard to see, but the 3-D exam produces better results in all women, she says.

The new exam will likely save lives by finding cancers earlier and give women ""more options,"" such as skipping chemotherapy or getting a lighter dose, says Laurie Margolies, director of Breast Imaging at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Dr. Margolies has briefly consulted for Hologic but has no continuing relationship with the company.

In addition to finding more tumors, early experience shows the 3-D exam may reduce anxiety-producing ""recalls,"" in which women are told to return for a diagnostic work-up after the mammogram looks unclear or concerning; recalls are mostly false alarms. In a 7,529-woman study at Yale University, the recall rate of women screened with 3-D and 2-D mammography combined was 6.6%, compared with 11.1% for 2-D alone.

The full exam typically includes a standard 2-D view as well as a 3-D one and has a patient under compression for a total of about 48 seconds, compared with 20 for a standard exam, Hologic says. Insurance often doesn't cover the 3-D portion so doctors say you often need to pay about $50 out of pocket. (The 2-D exam is done in part to aid in comparing results with earlier scans, Hologic says.)

The combination exam delivers 8.8 milligray of radiation per exam, around double what is given during a standard exam on Hologic 2-D machines, the company says. The double radiation dose could potentially cause cancer in 1 in 1,000 women who get 3-D mammography annually from age 40 until 80 instead of the standard exam, according to the Food and Drug Administration.

The more-detailed exam will save lives overall over the 2-D scan if at least 3% more cancers are detected, which appears likely from preliminary data, says Peter Soltani, senior vice president of breast health at Hologic. He adds that small amounts of radiation from mammography have never been proven to cause cancer.

Hologic has applied to the FDA for approval to market a technology that would synthesize a 2-D image from detail taken in the 3-D sweep and which physicians say would significantly lower the radiation because you'd only have to take one set of images instead of two. General Electric Co. is also applying to the FDA for permission to market a 3-D mammography machine; the company declined to say when it expects a decision.

"MONDAY, Oct. 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new anti-clotting drug called apixaban was better than warfarin at preventing stroke in patients with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation, a new study found.

Data from more than 18,000 patients also found that apixaban was safer overall than warfarin, and tended to cause less bleeding in the skull in patients who faced the highest risk of bleeding.

The findings suggest that the current risk scoring systems for tailoring anti-clotting (anticoagulant) treatment to individual patients may be less relevant when using apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for stroke, according to the Duke University Medical Center researchers.

""The benefits of apixaban are preserved, regardless of the risk score used and regardless of the patient risk category,"" study author and cardiologist Dr. Renato Lopes said in a Duke news release. ""With new oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, we might not need risk scores to guide treatment decisions for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. This may simplify how physicians make decisions and also improve patient care.""

Study co-investigator Dr. Jack Ansell agreed.

""This analysis provides further support for the benefit of apixaban, but given the very low risk of bleeding with apixaban, it also suggests that the current stroke and bleeding risk scores may not be sensitive enough to tease out those patients with the very lowest risk of stroke who might benefit from apixaban therapy,"" said Ansell, who is chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and a consultant to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the companies that are marketing the drug as Eliquis. The drug has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

The study was published online Oct. 1 in The Lancet.

Apixaban showed a 21 percent relative reduction in the incidence of strokes or systemic embolisms (clots) when compared to warfarin, a 31 percent relative reduction in major bleeding and an 11 percent relative reduction in overall mortality, the researchers found.

Atrial fibrillation affects more than 2.6 million people in the United States. In people with atrial fibrillation, disorganized electrical activity causes ineffective contraction of the upper chambers of the heart. This increases the risk for blood clots that can cause stroke.

Current practice guidelines permit the use of either anti-clotting therapy with aspirin or warfarin. Aspirin is less effective than warfarin, but carries a lower risk of bleeding for patients with atrial fibrillation and one risk factor for stroke.

"SATURDAY, Sept. 29, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers say they've discovered a two-drug combination that delays treatment resistance in patients with advanced melanoma.

By targeting different points in the same growth-factor pathway, the kinase inhibitor drugs dabrafenib and trametinib postponed the development of drug resistance in patients with BRAF-positive metastatic melanoma, the study authors said.

Melanoma is the most serious, and often deadly, form of skin cancer. In about half of patients with melanoma that has spread, tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the BRAF protein -- part of the MAPK cell growth pathway -- constantly activated. Drugs that inhibit BRAF activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about 90 percent of patients. But the response is temporary in most cases, and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months, the researchers explained.

Previous research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the MAPK pathway gets turned back on through activation of MEK, another protein that is part off the MAPK pathway.

""We investigated this (drug) combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to BRAF inhibitor therapy,"" study lead author Dr. Keith Flaherty, of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center, said in a hospital news release.

The phase 1 and 2 study was sponsored by GlaxoSmithKline, which developed both drugs.

""We found that adding the MEK inhibitor trametinib to BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance. In fact, the combination was at least twice as effective as BRAF inhibition alone,"" he said.

One expert agreed that the results were encouraging.

""This study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen-activated protein kinase [MAPK] pathway. This study combined dabrafenib [a selective BRAF inhibitor] and trametinib, [a selective MAPK kinase (MEK) inhibitor]. These drugs can be safely combined, and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects,"" said Dr. Michele Green, a dermatologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

The study was conducted at 14 sites in the United States and Australia and included 162 patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs: two daily 150 milligram (mg) doses of dabrafenib plus one 2 mg dose of trametinib; the same dabrafenib dose with a 1 mg dose of trametinib; or treatment with dabrafenib alone.

Patients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full-dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression.

Treatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four-month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone. After one year of treatment, 41 percent of patients receiving the full-dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma, compared with 9 percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone.

Among patients receiving the combination treatment, the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs.

The study was scheduled for presentation Saturday at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Vienna and simultaneous publication in the New England Journal of Medicine.

The drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase 3 study, which is required for U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval.

"For men diagnosed with prostate cancer, the decision about how to treat it -- or even whether to treat it -- can be agonizing. Surgery, radiation, or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence, impotence and rectal damage. Doctors usually can’t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects. While some risk factors are well-known -- including age, diabetes and poor cardiovascular health -- whether a man suffers harsh side-effects is often chalked up to random luck.

So what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications?

New research, published Thursday in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer. Knowing a man’s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy.

“More often than not, it’s not clear-cut which way to go,” explained Barry Rosenstein, professor of radiation oncology at Mt. Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. “If you see a surgeon, he’s likely to say surgery is best. If you see a radiation oncologist he’ll say oncology.”

Determining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer. The debate whether to even test for it is ongoing. This early-stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision.

The researchers started with a pool of 841 men treated with radiation for prostate cancer. Patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years. The number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to 260 patients with erectile dysfunction and 205 controls.

The scientists then performed DNA analyses on the men, looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms, or SNPs (pronounced snips), slight differences in the “spelling” of our DNA. After sifting through hundreds of thousands of SNPs, they settled on 12 suspect genetic variations.

It turned out that when the SNPs were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications, having just one of the 12 SNPs more than doubled the risk. The more of the 12 a man had, the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications.

“It is cumulative,” Rosenstein explained. “If a man has five or six, it increases his chances quite a bit.”

The research is still in the early stages, so doctors aren’t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon. “This is still not nearly good enough, yet” he said.

But he’s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality. The next step, he said, is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found.

If they can, then doctors really will be “able to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications,” he said. “And if we can do that, then there’ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic.”

Even better, he suggested, it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the SNiPs, or the biological processes they influence, as a way to prevent damage from therapy.

That hope is evident to other researchers, such as Dr. Ithaar Derweesh, a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the University of California San Diego Moores Cancer Center.

""This is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed,"" Derweesh said.

While Derweesh agreed with Rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate, and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy -- something he called the ""holy grail"" -- he suggested that in the nearer term, such markers might be used as a trigger to pre-emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage.

This kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer, but all cancers. While there has been greater success in treating cancer, survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment. If Rosenstein’s hopes are fulfilled, it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it’s done, and still effectively treat the cancer.

TUESDAY, Sept. 11, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new device meant to help surgeons determine in the operating room if they have removed all cancerous breast cancer tissue may help reduce repeat surgeries after lumpectomy without compromising cosmetic effects, according to a new study.

The device, called MarginProbe, emits an electric field and senses a return signal from the tissue examined. Cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue, the researchers explained.

""This can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your [cosmetic] outcome,"" said study leader Dr. Susan Boolbol, chief of breast surgery at Beth Israel Medical Center, in New York City.

The study of nearly 500 patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods.

""The reality is, most of the time we leave the operating room and we don't know if we have a clear margin [with all cancer removed] or not,"" Boolbol said. Doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out, which can take a week or two. With the new device, the wait time is about five minutes.

""Everything still goes through pathology,"" Boolbol said. But the MarginProbe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery, she said.

Boolbol is scheduled to present the findings Thursday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's breast cancer symposium in San Francisco.

In June, the radiation-free device won the blessing of a U.S. Food and Drug Administration advisory panel. The FDA usually follows the advisory panel's recommendations, so device approval is anticipated.

For the study, Boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned 495 breast cancer patients to receive the MarginProbe after lumpectomy or not receive it. Of those, 161 had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ. The others had invasive cancers.

Where the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined, surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure.

Typically, about 40 percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor.

""We looked at whether we could lower the [repeat surgery] rate by using this device,"" Boolbol said. The patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery. For those with ductal carcinoma in situ, 13 percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery, compared to 37 percent of the control group.

Among women with invasive breast cancer, 17 percent in the device group and 33 percent in the comparison group required more surgery.

Looking at the volume of tissue excised, the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control-group patients, Boolbol said.

Dr. Laura Kruper, director of the Cooper Finkel Women's Health Center and co-director of the breast cancer program at City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., said the device looks promising. However, she thinks more research is needed.

""I would like to see it [used] in a larger population,"" she said. If the results are repeated in larger studies, it could be a welcome addition to doctors' techniques, she said.

The expected cost of the MarginProbe in the United States, if approved, is not yet known, said Michael Graffeo, a spokesman for its maker, Dune Medical Devices. In Europe, where the device is available, each probe (one per patient) sells for about 600 euros or $760, he said. This is much less than the cost of re-operation, he noted.

The device is also being studied for use with prostate cancer, the company said.

Data and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Acupuncture may help relieve chronic back, joint and shoulder pain, according to a new review of the evidence - but some of its benefit is likely due to the “placebo effect,” researchers concluded.

In an analysis of 29 studies, they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn’t.

But patients treated with fake or “sham” acupuncture - using retracting needles that don’t stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure.

“A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,” such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

“This provides evidence that they would be justified in considering… acupuncture,” he told Reuters Health.

Acupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia.

Some think it has potential as an add-on or alternative to standard treatment, while others argue any acupuncture-related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them.

That either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are “wasting their time” - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said.

To try to help sort out which is the case, he and his colleagues analyzed 29 studies they deemed to be high-quality comparisons of acupuncture, fake acupuncture and no treatment. Those trials included close to 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe with back and neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis.

The researchers found that on average, people treated with acupuncture reported a “modest” improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment, and a larger effect compared to untreated patients.

They estimated in their Archives of Internal Medicine report that about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy.

A typical acupuncture session runs for about $100 and is often not covered by health insurance.

USUALLY NOT THE FIRST STEP

“I have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture,” said Jongbae Park, head of Asian Medicine & Acupuncture Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine.

It’s usually “not their first approach to address the condition,” he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain.

Park, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would.

“I am a biased clinician,” Park told Reuters Health. But, he added, “I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement.”

Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.

For two decades, Patricia DiGiusto struggled with severe asthma. Powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room.

On one particularly bad night, Ms. DiGiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe. Gasping for air, she was certain she would not survive.

“I’ll never forget that feeling,” said Ms. DiGiusto, 65, a speech pathologist in Braintree, Mass. “The feeling that I’m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me.”

Two years ago, Ms. DiGiusto’s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty, the first non-drug therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration for patients with severe asthma.

During the procedure, a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient’s airways. There, it heats the lungs to 149 degrees Fahrenheit — cooler than a cup of coffee, but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways, which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing. After the procedure, the airways no longer are so prone to constricting, studies show. Asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits.

Ms. DiGiusto had the procedure in March 2011. Since then, she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack. “I’m a language therapist,” she said, “but I can’t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life.”

Across the country, about 24 million people suffer from asthma. Every year, about 3,400 die because of it.

Avoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients. But for the minority with severe persistent asthma, medication and lifestyle changes are not enough. Frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable, and powerful steroids like prednisone — which can cause thinning bones, cataracts, depression and other debilitating side effects — become a necessity.

Nationwide, asthma treatment costs exceed $10 billion a year, and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics, who make up only 10 percent of the asthma population.

Doctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma, and many patients call it life-changing. But the procedure is expensive, costing around $20,000, and insurers have been reluctant to cover it. As a result, many people who need it, doctors say, are forced to go without it.

“For those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are, it’s frustrating because we have this new therapy, we’ve seen it work, and the data says it works,” said Dr. Roy St. John, a pulmonary disease specialist at Columbus Pulmonary and Critical Care in Ohio. “But the big insurers have all denied it.”

Although bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the F.D.A. only two years ago, clinical studies on it began in 2000. Since then, about 650 patients across the country have had the procedure.

It takes place in three steps, each separated by about three weeks. Each time, a different section of the lungs is treated. Some patients report temporary coughing, mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways.

But several five-year studies showed no long-term safety issues. And researchers at Washington University School of Medicine found that compared with a control group, bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third, their emergency room visits fall by 84 percent, and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by 66 percent.

“This isn’t a cure, but it is definitely a breakthrough,” said Dr. Pratik S. Patel, director of Interventional Pulmonary Medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey. “It’s not going to get rid of asthma, but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life.” For now, the procedure is only for severe asthmatics, who — unlike a vast majority of asthma patients — cannot keep flare-ups at bay with standard medications, said Dr. Kyle Hogarth, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment.

“There are millions and millions of asthmatics,” he said. “There will not be millions of thermoplasty patients.”

Still, even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure. Susan Pisano, a spokeswoman for America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry trade group, said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five-year clinical trial, required by the F.D.A. when it approved bronchial thermoplasty. That trial will not be completed until at least 2018.

Until then, Ms. Pisano said, many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental. “The issue here for health plans is the long-term safety and efficacy have yet to be established,” she said.

But three five-year studies have already been completed. Many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach. The one-time cost of $20,000, they say, is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year.

One such patient, Alberto Gaulion, 68, a retired importer in Miami, estimated that for much of the last decade, his insurer, Blue Cross Blue Shield, spent about $50,000 a year on his medical care.

“Every two or three weeks I had to go to the hospital,” he said, “and I was taking everything that was on the market. I was on a cocktail of drugs.”

Blue Cross would not cover the procedure for him, so Mr. Gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in 2010. Since then, he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks, and takes only one medication instead of five.

“Now I can breathe,” he said, “and I’m saving my insurance company a fortune.”

Dr. Charlene McEvoy, a director of an asthma center run by Health Partners, the largest health plan in Minnesota, believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it. Dr. McEvoy argued that it made economic sense, and earlier this year Health Partners agreed.

“When plans look at the cost savings, I think they’re going to cover it,” said Dr. McEvoy, an assistant professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. “You have to show that there’s a return on investment.”",1

MONDAY, Aug. 6, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Treatment with growth hormone-releasing hormone improves memory and focus in healthy adults and in those who already show some signs of mental decline, new research finds.

""Growth hormone-releasing hormone doesn't target one specific area in the body and brain,"" said study lead author Laura Baker, an associate professor of psychiatry and behavioral science at the University of Washington School of Medicine, in Seattle. ""It stimulates a whole cascade of hormones in the body and brain; it stimulates normal function of a system that was working at a younger age so that cells can do what they were programmed to do at birth.""

Results of the study are published in the Aug. 6 issue of the Archives of Neurology.

As levels of growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH) decrease with age, so too do other hormones stimulated by GHRH, such as growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor 1. All of these hormones are believed to play a role in brain health, and decreasing levels of these hormones are suspected to play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease.

In a previous study, Baker and her colleagues demonstrated that treatment with GHRH provided a short-term boost in memory and concentration for healthy adults. In the current study, they wanted to see if GHRH could help restore some function in people who were showing signs of a condition known as mild cognitive impairment. People with this condition don't yet have Alzheimer's disease, but they do have problems with memory and focus, and they're at higher risk of developing Alzheimer's disease, according to the Alzheimer's Foundation.

In all, 137 adults, including 61 with mild cognitive impairment, completed the current study. The study volunteers were between 55 and 87 years old, with an average age of 68, according to the study.

The study participants were randomly assigned to receive a daily self-administered injection of growth hormone-releasing hormone or a placebo injection for 20 weeks. The study medications were supplied by the manufacturer of the growth hormone-releasing hormone.

Study funding was provided by grants from the U.S. National Institute on Aging and the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.

Tests to measure mental prowess were given at the start of the study, and at 10, 20 and 30 weeks after treatment began.

Baker said the researchers saw benefits in healthy adults and those with mild cognitive impairment who received GHRH. They saw improvement in ""planning, organizing, focusing and shifting from one task to another"" -- tasks collectively known as executive function. Baker said the researchers also saw a mild improvement in verbal memory in those treated with GHRH, but the results weren't as strong as for the executive function tasks.

Treatment with GHRH boosted levels of insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF1) by 117 percent, according to the study. ""IGF1 is a hormone we all have from birth that increases through development until it starts to decline in our early 50s. It promotes all kinds of growth in the body and brain, but if you have excess IGF1, it may put you at risk for cancer,"" said Baker, who added that people with Alzheimer's disease tend to have low levels of IGF1.

Benefits from the treatment lasted as long as people stayed on the treatment. When treatment was stopped, the benefits gradually tapered off, Baker said.

Insulin levels also spiked during treatment with GHRH, but only in the group already having memory problems. Baker said it wasn't clear why this happened, but she suspects the body may be trying to compensate for an insulin shortage in the brain in people with memory problems. Insulin helps glucose (sugar) enter cells to provide fuel for those cells.

Dr. Joel Zonszein, an endocrinologist from Montefiore Medical Center, in New York City, praised the study but said some questions still remain.

""This was an impressive study showing how GHRH can have a positive effect on cognitive function,"" Zonszein said. ""The question is, how can we use this in normal individuals? When GHRH goes down with aging, it's a physiological adaptation. And, we don't know what would happen if we gave it chronically.""

For instance, ""would you alter the feedback mechanism that keeps IGF1 levels from increasing cancer risk? Would it start to lose some of its effect long term?"" he said.

""There may be both good and bad effects,"" Zonszein added.

The researchers said larger and longer trials are needed to assess the hormone's therapeutic potential.

"According to a U.S. government advisory panel, almost no one should get screened for prostate cancer. But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. To screen or not to screen: here's why experts still can't agree

Mike Albans / NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images PSA blood testing at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y.

If you’re wondering why experts still can’t agree on prostate-cancer screening, you’re not alone.

Just two months ago, a major U.S. government panel said that basically no one should get screened for prostate cancer, claiming the simple blood test for prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, does more harm than good. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal.

“Almost all men with clinically apparent metastases at initial diagnosis will die from prostate cancer,” urologist and study author Edward Messing told reporters, as he explained the importance of his study.

The new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely.

(MORE: Men Should Forgo PSA Testing, U.S. Panel Advises)

No one denies that PSA tests can help to catch prostate cancer early. But two issues are still unresolved. One is how well screening can actually work to prevent cancer deaths; the other is what kind of negative effects screening brings along with its benefits.

On the first issue, there is still some uncertainty. In the U.S., a large randomized trial found no mortality benefit of screening. But an even larger randomized clinical trial in Europe has found a benefit. In its latest results published this spring, the European study team said that men who undergo routine testing have significantly lower risk of prostate-cancer death after 11 years.

Still, the real crux of the debate on PSA testing is the second issue: the possible negative effects of screening. No diagnostic test is 100% accurate, and if a PSA test comes back positive for prostate cancer, the patient will usually be referred for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. That test can have side effects. Then, if the patient does have cancer, the available treatments for it — surgery, radiation, as well as other options — also have side effects, chief among them impotence, incontinence, and urinary incontinence. The same European trial that found lower cancer mortality with PSA testing also found that, to save just one life through screening, an extra 37 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated. Many health experts think that’s too much risky treatment to justify the results.

So when the government advisory panel — the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — recommends against routine PSA testing, it’s making a judgment call. It’s saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. But that decision does remain a judgment call. It depends on how much you value certain quality-of-life measures versus how much you value having any life at all.

(MORE: Surgery for Early Prostate Cancer Doesn’t Save Lives)

As for the new paper this week, which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren’t for PSA testing, that study is published in the journal Cancer — and its numbers deserve a little explanation. To calculate the total number of metastatic cases we’d get without screening, the study takes today’s population of the United States and applies the rates (broken down by age and race) of advanced-stage prostate cancer that were observed before PSA testing was introduced — that is, the rates way back in 1983-85.

In other words, it tells us what the current U.S. population would look like if today we faced the same risks that Americans faced in the ’80s; it finds we’d have roughly 25,000 U.S. men diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer each year compared to just 8,000 today. But is going back in time 30 years really the same thing that we’d get if we abolished PSA testing today? Who knows? The rate of new diagnoses of all cancer types combined has been falling consistently in recent years. However, prostate cancer is one of the few cancers that’s not strongly linked to smoking (and falling cigarette consumption over the past 40 years is a major reason for falling cancer rates). It is, however, linked to obesity, which has been on the rise since the 1980s.

One further fact to keep in mind is that PSA testing works to cut the number of newly diagnosed advanced-stage cancers — but it does so by increasing the number of cancers that are caught early. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process. That’s what experts can’t agree about.

Many doctors do have very strong opinions, though. As a patient, if you’re deciding whether to get a PSA test, or whether not to get a PSA test, remember you do have a right to your own opinion too. There’s no easy answer.

"Take two slices of cherry pie and call me in the morning.

OK. That’s not quite the advice doctors are wont to give. But it might make at least a sliver of sense.

Cherry pie contains the same sort of anti-inflammatory compounds as aspirin and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs — at least the cherries do. They’re tart, or sour, cherries, which, as far as is known, contain more of these anti-inflammatory compounds than any other food, says Dr. Kerry Kuehl, assistant director of the Human Performance Laboratory at Oregon Health and Science University in Portland.

Kuehl is a coauthor of a new study suggesting that tart cherries could someday provide an alternative treatment for patients with inflammatory osteoarthritis who can’t tolerate the standard drug therapy.

Advertisement

Participants in the study — presented at the American College of Sports Medicine Conference in San Francisco in May —- were 20 women, 40 to 70 years old, who had all been diagnosed with inflammatory osteoarthritis and had experienced joint swelling at least once in the last year. Twice a day, half of the women drank 10.5 fluid ounces of tart cherry juice. The other half drank that much fake cherry juice with the same calorie content, flavor and consistency.

After three weeks, the women who got the real stuff had significantly less inflammation, as measured by C-reactive protein in their blood, than those who had been drinking the counterfeit.

The anti-inflammatory powers of tart cherries can make them a smart choice for healthy people too. In a number of studies, athletes who drank tart cherry juice before running a race or doing intensive strength exercises felt less pain afterward and bounced back faster than those who didn’t.

But tart cherries aren’t just loaded with wham-bam anti-inflammatories. They’re chockablock with antioxidants. And a 2011 study in the European Journal of Nutrition suggests that drinking tart cherry juice during the day may pay off in better snoozing at night, thanks to high levels of the sleep-regulating antioxidant melatonin.

These studies have been done with people, but other promising research has only been done with lab animals so far. In one 2009 study in the Journal of Medicinal Food, tart cherries helped fat rats. Not our favorite role models perhaps, but the obese beasties’ risk of Type 2 diabetes and heart disease were reduced significantly, and parallel studies are now in the works with members of our own species, says lead author E. Mitchell Seymour: “There are some interesting and potentially exciting results on the horizon. Stay tuned.”

So, what’s not to like about tart cherries? Not much ... except for maybe the “tart” part. Let’s just say, the cherry topping off your hot fudge sundae is not a tart cherry. The alluring cherries in the produce aisle are not tart cherries. And those cherries that a happy life is supposedly just a bowl of? They’re not tart cherries either.

“Tart cherries are extremely bitter raw,” Kuehl admits. “Unpalatable.”

But hey! There is a solution: Don’t eat tart cherries raw. Eat them dried or frozen (in smoothies) or drink them in juice. Even unsweetened, something about juicing makes them taste better, Kuehl says. “Some people really like it.”

And, of course, you can always bake a pie.

"After her mother unexpectedly died from a tear in the wall of her heart at age 63, Patricia Walters talked to her doctor, Leslie Cho, about how to better monitor her own heart health.

Pregnant at the time with her own daughter, Ms. Walters, now 46, says she was ""a nervous wreck"" worrying that she, too, might face serious cardiac risk.

As part of an overall health evaluation after the pregnancy, Dr. Cho, director of the Women's Cardiovascular Center at the Cleveland Clinic, recommended a simple blood test called hs-CRP—for high sensitivity C-reactive protein, which is a marker for inflammation in the body.

Easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening, and covered by most insurance, the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heart-attack and stroke risk.

Greater Accuracy

The hs-CRP test is a newer, more sensitive version of a standard CRP check, and experts say it can more accurately detect lower concentrations of the protein, making it more useful in predicting a healthy person's risk for cardiovascular disease. It measures CRP in milligrams per liter of blood: less than 1.0 mg/l is considered low risk; 1.0 to 3.0 mg/l is average risk; and greater than 3.0 mg/l is considered high risk for cardiovascular disease.

The American Heart Association and the American College of Cardiology both have endorsed the use of hs-CRP for ""intermediate risk"" individuals. And one major study suggests that even people with minimal risk factors in their late 50s and early 60s should have the test.

While inflammation is the body's natural response to a variety of physical states, including fever, injury and infection, research shows it also plays a role in a range of chronic illnesses, including cardiovascular disease. Inflammation of the arteries has been linked to heart attack, sudden death and stroke, Dr. Cho notes.

Those who smoke, have high blood pressure, and are overweight and sedentary tend to have high levels of CRP—and those who are thin and fit have lower levels. But genetic factors can also contribute to elevated CRP in people without traditional risk factors.

Research shows that elevated levels of CRP are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels. A 1997 study of healthy physicians, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, was the first to show that relative risk of first heart attack or stroke was directly related to elevated CRP levels. And the Harvard Women's Health Study, which looked at 12 different markers of inflammation in healthy postmenopausal women, found that after three years CRP was the strongest predictor of risk.

Not-So-Low Risk

While some experts don't think the hs-CRP test adds much to current cardiovascular risk-prediction strategies, others say a large study known as the Jupiter trial supports broad use of the test to find people who may assume their low cholesterol levels protect them from heart trouble—and determine whether they might be candidates for treatment with statin drugs. The 2008 study showed that in patients with low levels of LDL—the bad cholesterol—but high hs-CRP levels, the statin Crestor reduced the risk of heart-related death, heart attacks and other serious cardiac problems by 44% compared with those given placebos.

Paul Ridker, a Harvard University researcher who led the Jupiter study, says, ""We know that those with elevated hs-CRP are at high risk even if cholesterol levels are low, and that statin therapy can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in this group."" While the study showed inflammation contributes as much to cardiovascular risk as does high blood pressure or high cholesterol, Dr. Ridker says ""the core research question now is whether or not reducing inflammation per se will reduce that risk.""

His team has now launched two major clinical trials—one funded by the federal government and one by industry—to address that question. (Dr. Ridker is co-inventor on patents held by Brigham and Women's Hospital related to the use of inflammatory biomarkers including hs-CRP in evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease.)

Something to Talk About

Dr. Cho at the Cleveland Clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment.

""If you are 53 and chubby with high blood pressure and borderline high cholesterol but your CRP is normal, I'm not sure I would throw the whole kitchen sink at you,"" says Dr. Cho. ""But if your CRP was elevated, I would want to talk to you about the Jupiter results"" and discuss starting a statin. She also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss, nutrition and exercise.

Ms. Walters didn't have high levels when she was first tested, but they began to rise in later screenings. She now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly. She also joined Weight Watchers to drop a few pounds and runs with friends for exercise.

A former teacher who is now a stay-at-home mom, Ms. Walters says, ""I have a little girl, and I plan to be here for everything.""

"Bathing-suit season is here and with it, anxiety over cellulite. A new laser device that burrows under the skin is getting praise from some doctors who say it gives more dramatic and longer-lasting results than previous treatments, but others caution that more research is needed.

Cellulite is a dimpled, uneven appearance of skin caused by fat underneath. It affects some 85% of women and about 5% of men. Until recently, the main treatments to battle cellulite have been external treatments such as creams and radio-frequency and massage devices. The creams are largely ineffective and the devices have a modest effect that typically lasts about six months, doctors say.

A therapy called Cellulaze, which uses a laser machine sold by Cynosure Inc. in Westford, Mass., hit the U.S. market in February. Some doctors say the results are impressive. ""The results are nothing short of remarkable,"" says Los Angeles plastic surgeon Grant Stevens, a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles. Dr. Stevens, who isn't affiliated with Cynosure, said he and another doctor in his practice together have treated about 40 patients with Cellulaze.

The Cellulaze laser machine Cynosure

Based on the published scientific data, Cellulaze is ""promising,"" says Mathew M. Avram, director of the Dermatology Laser & Cosmetic Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. But ""we need more clinical experience before we can make any definitive statements as to the efficacy of the device.""

Cellulaze is different from earlier treatments in that it tackles the root causes of cellulite, including thinning skin and connective fibers called septae that are believed to create tension by pulling down the skin, contributing to an uneven appearance, says Gordon H. Sasaki, a clinical professor of plastic surgery at Loma Linda University Medical University Center in Loma Linda, Calif. Dr. Sasaki is a paid consultant to Cynosure.

How Cellulaze Works: • Tiny incisions are made so a cannula, or tube, can be inserted into the skin. • Local anesthetic is inserted through the cannula. • Laser light through the cannula cuts septae—which scientists say help cause cellulite dimples. The underside of the skin is heated and some small amounts of fat are melted. • Bruises and tiny scars result, but fade with time. • Compression garments recommended to prevent fluid buildup.

Cellulaze is done by plastic surgeons in their offices under local anesthetic. It typically costs $5,000 to $7,000 for a bilateral area, such as the thighs, and another $2,500 or more for each additional area. One or more tiny incisions are made so a narrow tube called a cannula can be inserted into the skin. Laser light, delivered through the cannula, cuts the septae and melts small amounts of fat, Dr. Sasaki says. It heats the underside of the skin, which stimulates collagen production and makes skin thicker and more elastic, he adds.

Cellulaze leaves tiny scars—about two millimeters long—which fade with time, surgeons say. Typically, compression garments are recommended for at least two or three weeks to prevent fluid buildup. And there will be bruises, so patients typically need to wait three to six weeks before venturing out in a bathing suit, surgeons say.

The procedure can cause a buildup of fluid in the area that has been treated, which can last for months and needs to be drained regularly by a doctor.

In a written statement, Cynosure says ""a few"" patients in early trials had the buildups, called seromas, adding that they need to be drained to prevent infections and other complications. The company says it has since lowered the recommended laser dosage and it isn't aware of any seromas since the device hit the U.S. market.

According to a company-funded study of 10 women published last year in Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Cellulaze resulted in skin that was 25% thicker after a year. Cellulite reduction was ""good"" to ""excellent"" as graded by physicians.

Dr. Sasaki, in data obtained as part of a company-financed trial that has yet to be published, says 80% of 25 patients he treated are still enjoying ""substantial improvement"" two years after the surgery.

Lawrence Bass, director of the minimally invasive plastic-surgery program at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York, says the procedure appears to reduce the depth of cellulite dimples. A person with less-pronounced dimples is ""most likely to get a home run"" out of the procedure, says Dr. Bass, who has attended scientific presentations of the data but hasn't performed the procedure. But if you have really deep ones, he adds, ""it might not be enough to make the lifestyle change you want to make, such as wearing shorts in the summertime.""

The cannula Cynosure

If a deep dimple is still visible, fat can be injected with a syringe later to even it out, Dr. Sasaki says.

Another new laser treatment both for cellulite and body contouring is i-Lipo, i-Lipo, from Chromogenex Technologies Ltd., South Wales, England. The laser, which hit the U.S. market in December, is noninvasive and involves pads placed externally on the skin. I-Lipo provokes a chemical reaction that breaks down fat into its components, says company clinical manager Donna Freeman. After the treatment, a cardiovascular workout of 30 to 40 minutes is recommended to burn off the components.

The ""Ultra"" model of the device comes with a vacuum-massage device aimed at smoothing cellulite, but the effects on cellulite haven't yet been tested in a clinical trial, the company says. A 34-patient study, unpublished, found eight 20-minute sessions with the device reduced midsection size by 1.8 inches, measured by a tape measure, compared with only a third of an inch for a sham therapy, which looked the same to patients.

Dr. Bass says he is ""skeptical"" because measuring-tape data has a large margin of error. Chromogenex says the measurements used scientifically accepted standards.

MONDAY, July 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Men may one day have a birth-control option other than the condom or vasectomy -- if early research on a new contraceptive gel pans out.

Preliminary findings suggest that when applied to the skin, the gel dramatically lowers sperm counts, thus also lowering -- though not eliminating -- the risk for pregnancy.

This is the first time that a combination of testosterone and a synthetic progestin called Nestorone has been tested as a gel that could be applied topically. Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.

The combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available.

Although men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved.

""I think [men] would use it more than is realized,"" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. ""Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women.""

Unfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men.

The results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston.

According to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months.

The study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a ""placebo"" gel with no progestin.

Up to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone.

Normal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website.

Up to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone.

The testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained.

One important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be.

The answer, said Wang, is ""We just don't know.""

That's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants.

A new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated.

Another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said.

In addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone.

Because the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

TUESDAY, June 26, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Electroencephalogram (EEG), a test that shows the electrical activity of the brain, might be used to spot autism in children, a new study suggests.

The study, conducted by researchers at Harvard University Medical School, looked at the synchronization of brain activity across different brain regions, as measured by EEG.

""These scientists used sensors to record electrical brain activity across many different regions on the scalp,"" explained Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer at the advocacy group Autism Speaks. ""They then looked at the extent to which brain activity from one region was synchronized with brain activity from another region,"" a phenomenon known as ""EEG coherence,"" said Dawson, who was not involved in the research.

""Synchronization between different brain regions indicates that those regions are functioning in a coordinated, rather than independent, fashion -- in other words, they are functionally connected and communicating with each other,"" she said.

In the new study, Dr. Frank Duffy and Dr. Heidelise Als compared EEG measurements of nearly 1,000 children with and without autism. They found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity.

EEG revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity, indicating poor function of local brain networks. This was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language.

The children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart, which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity, the researchers said.

The research was conducted at Boston Children's Hospital and was published online June 25 in the journal BMC Medicine.

The use of EEG-based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants, leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies, the researchers said.

""What was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied,"" Dawson noted. ""Consistent with many previous studies using EEG and functional MRI with both children and adults with autism, these investigators found that, overall, children with autism show reduced coordination (coherence) across brain regions.""

She said the findings are important because, ""they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors, such as social interaction and language. As children's brains develop, the different brain regions become increasingly connected, allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions.""

Language, for example, requires coordination across the auditory, visual, and motor brain regions, as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex, she said.

""This reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism,"" she added. ""The hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments, helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children.""

Another expert agreed.

""Although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis, this study ... may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age,"" said Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven & Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, NY.

The number of children diagnosed with autism in the United States has recently increased to one in 88.

"If you're one of the estimated 27 million Americans with osteoarthritis, you're probably all too familiar with the feeling of aching, swollen, or stiff knees.

Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may relieve those painful symptoms in most patients. But for others, doctors may prescribe a more invasive treatment that involves injecting hyaluronic acid in to the knee, called viscosupplementation.

Now, a new report questions the efficacy of this treatment for osteoarthritis in the knee.

Hyaluronic acid is a lubricating fluid that is naturally found in the knee, but degenerates over time in people with osteoarthritis. The effect of the injection used in viscosupplementation is to stimulate cells in the knee to increase production of hyaluronic acid.



In a meta-analysis of 177 reports that included data on more than 12,000 patients with osteoarthritis in the knee, researchers at the Institute of Social and Preventive Medicine at the University of Bern in Switzerland concluded that the treatment ""has minimal benefits and potential for harm.""

They write that ""because of increased risks for serious adverse events and local adverse events, the administration of these preparations should be discouraged.""

Dr. John Richmond disagrees. He is the Chairman of the Orthopedics Department at New England Baptist Hospital and the previous Chair of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) working group on treatment of osteoarthritis in knees.

""We have an epidemic of osteoarthritis of the knee and we have limited treatment options,"" says Dr. Richmond, who was not affiliated with the analysis but who reviewed the same data it was based on. ""This needs to remain one of those limited treatment options and should be used appropriately by the physician giving it.""

The most common side effects patients undergoing viscosupplementation may endure are flare-ups - where the knee becomes hot and swollen within 24 hours after the injection - and effusions, where excessive joint fluid collects inside the knee. The researchers in Switzerland reviewed the existing studies and concluded that viscosupplementation was associated with an increase in these and other adverse events.

Dr. Richmond, who has independently reviewed the same research when the AAOS was drafting their recommendations to treat osteoarthritis of the knee, argues that despite infrequent instances of those side-effects, viscosupplementation remains a solid treatment choice for some patients.

""This is most effective in relatively younger patients, 40 to 50 to 60 year olds, and...in people with mild to moderate forms of the disease,"" says Richmond. ""This is not a first line treatment, but it's a reasonable treatment in those people who have been appropriately screened.""

The authors of the study discourage patients from getting this treatment. However, Richmond says patients considering viscosupplementation should discuss this as a treatment option with their doctor.",0
"June 7, 2012 -- Drinking three cups of coffee per day may help turn the tide against Alzheimer's disease among older adults who are already showing signs of memory problems, a new study shows.

According to the findings, people older than 65 who had higher blood levels of caffeine developed Alzheimer's disease two to four years later than their counterparts with lower caffeine levels. The findings will appear in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease.

Alzheimer's disease is the most common type of dementia. Symptoms include serious memory loss, confusion, and mood changes that develop gradually and worsen with time.

The new study included 124 people aged 65 to 88 who had mild cognitive impairment, which is the medical term for mild memory loss. About 15% of people with MCI develop full-blown Alzheimer's disease each year.

In the study, blood levels of caffeine were more than 50% lower among people with MCI who developed Alzheimer's during follow-up, when compared with their counterparts who did not worsen. Coffee was the main, or only source, of caffeine among people in the study.

No one with mild memory loss who later developed Alzheimer's had initial blood caffeine levels above 1,200 ng/ml. This is equivalent to drinking several cups of coffee a few hours before giving blood. People whose memory loss did not progress all had blood caffeine levels higher than this level, the study shows.

""Continue to drink coffee,"" says researcher Chuanhai Cao, PhD. He is a neuroscientist at the University of South Florida's College of Pharmacy and Byrd Alzheimer's Institute in Tampa. ""There is no reason to stop if you are experiencing memory problems.""

There may even be a reason to start for people in their late 30s and up, he says. ""Aim for an average of three, 8-ounce cups of coffee per day in the morning after eating breakfast.""",1

TUESDAY, June 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A simple blood test may help gauge prognosis and tailor treatments for women who have been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer.

The test, described in the June 6 online edition of The Lancet Oncology, measures how many tumor cells are circulating in the blood. In the new study, if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream, a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying.

""This may help with prognosis and staging of the cancer and, in the future, with targets for breast cancer treatments,"" said study lead author Dr. Anthony Lucci, a professor of surgery at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, in Houston.

Commenting on the findings, Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""We are moving into a state where we're looking at a person's individual tumor and this is another way to do that, potentially leading to treatment.""

Whether or not cancer has spread to the lymph nodes is currently the best way to predict survival in women with breast cancer. Even so, a substantial number of patients whose cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes will have a recurrence while some of those who do have lymph-node involvement won't relapse.

Blood tests similar to the one investigated in this study have been found to be useful to gauge how well patients who already have metastatic cancer will do.

For this study, researchers counted circulating tumor cells in 302 breast cancer patients who were about to undergo surgery but who hadn't yet received chemotherapy.

Circulating tumor cells were detectable in about one-quarter of the participants, the investigators found. Fifteen percent of these individuals had a relapse and 10 percent died during a five-year follow-up, compared with 3 percent and 2 percent, respectively, of patients who did not have circulating tumor cells.

The more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream, the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying, according to the report.

Although the test may not be far off in terms of clinical practice, ""we need additional studies,"" Lucci said.

One area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy.

Currently, the American Society of Clinical Oncology does not recommend that clinicians measure circulating tumor cells in patients.

And in an accompanying comment article, Justin Stebbing, a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at Imperial College in London, said that ""despite increasing evidence supporting the use of [circulating tumor cells] as biomarkers, how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain.""

According to Bernik, though, ""it makes sense that women who have circulating tumor cells would potentially be at higher risk of distant disease at some later date.""

The problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future, she noted.

""The cells also need to have a propensity to grow elsewhere,"" she said. ""Not every cancer cell becomes a metastatic cancer cell. Hopefully, gaining the ability to tell which cells are more likely to spread potentially could guide therapy,"" Bernik added.

According to Lucci, circulating tumor cells are also showing promise in predicting melanoma prognosis, so the method may be ""effective in several different tumor systems.""

"“Many of us theorize that the two are tied — inflammation causes seizures, and seizures cause inflammation,” said Orrin Devinsky, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at the New York University Langone Medical Center and William’s doctor. “Over time, both of them may feed off each other.”

About 50 million people worldwide, including more than 2.7 million people in the United States, are struggling with epilepsy in some form. Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior.

An epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It’s not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system’s response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role.

Scientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen’s encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy — the surgical removal of one of the brain’s hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects.

Eleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures.

The amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. “This is a novel finding,” Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. “It was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy.”

Normal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells’ capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become “distracted” by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle.

Now Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy.

Sixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.

The drug is now the subject of a Phase 2 trial involving 400 patients. “Anti-inflammatory therapies could at least supplement, and perhaps replace, anticonvulsants,” said Dr. Jacqueline French, a neurologist at the N.Y.U. Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial.

Replacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy’s underlying causes. “Giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,” Dr. French said.

But there are dangers to this approach. Steroids — potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments — can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment.

“Like any new field, there’s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,” said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. “The challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms.”

Still, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son. At William’s worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m.

Dr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose.

“I was taking his life into my hands, I know,” she said. “But the way I looked at it, he was going to die anyway.”

Since that night William has not had another seizure. He continues with the steroids and also follows the ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen that has proved beneficial for many with intractable epilepsy.

Steroids are “the one thing I refuse to take him off of,” Ms. Moller said. “The past year has been the best time of his life.”",1

An aspirin a day could keep skin cancer away, according to a new report in the journal Cancer.

Researchers in Denmark and the U.S. found that people taking common painkillers like aspirin and ibuprofen were less likely to develop skin cancer — including squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma — especially when they took the drugs for at least seven years or used them at least twice a week. It’s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers — a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users.

In the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients’ histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain.

(MORE: Will an Aspirin Prolong Your Life? It Depends)

Overall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found.

The longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn’t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation.

The drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors’ ability to expand and develop blood supplies.

“Given the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,” the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote.

(MORE: Aspirin, a Wonder Drug? Studies Show It May Prevent Cancer)

In the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn’t without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.)

But given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs’ anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. “We hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,” Johannesdottir said in a statement. “Also, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use.”

"MONDAY, May 21, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- The new blood thinner Xarelto appears to lower the chances of potentially fatal blood clots in high-risk heart patients, a U.S. Food and Drug Administration review has found.

The review came in briefing documents that were filed Monday in advance of an FDA advisory panel meeting Wednesday, at which the panel is to vote on whether to recommend approval of Xarelto for treating people with acute coronary syndrome (a group of conditions brought on by sudden reduced blood flow to the heart).

The FDA is not required to follow the advice of its expert panels, but the agency typically does. A final decision is expected by the end of June, according to the documents.

Xarelto (rivaroxaban) is one of a new class of blood thinners that have been developed to overcome some of the problems that exist with the standard treatment, warfarin (Coumadin), which requires constant dose monitoring. Warfarin's effectiveness also can be altered by certain foods and other medications. Xarelto already is approved for use by those with atrial fibrillation (irregular heartbeat) and by people who are having hip- or knee-replacement surgery.

In the FDA briefing documents, an agency reviewer recommended approving the drug for treatment of acute coronary syndrome, mostly because trial data showed there was a reduction in cardiovascular death, even though there was also an increased risk of potentially fatal bleeding.

""However, what is not reflected in the sponsor's analysis are minor bleeding events,"" FDA reviewer Dr. Karen Hicks wrote in the briefing documents. ""While it is true that these bleeding events typically do not lead to death or irreversible harm, these events may represent the biggest problem for both patients and health care providers if rivaroxaban is approved.""

""While reductions in [cardiovascular] death still trump these bleeding events, if rivaroxaban is approved, we should expect a number of bleeding events that will require medical attention,"" Hicks wrote. ""Carefully selecting patients for rivaroxaban therapy will be necessary to mitigate these bleeding risks.""

In research presented at the American Stroke Association's International Stroke Conference in New Orleans last February, Australian doctors followed more than 14,000 people who took either Xarelto or warfarin for a median of two years. Of those patients, 136 had bleeding in the brain.

People who took Xarelto -- and suffered from the most common type of atrial fibrillation and didn't have heart valve damage -- were about one-third less likely to experience bleeding in the brain than those who took warfarin, the investigators found.

"May 14, 2012 -- Acupuncture may allow people with the lung disease COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) to breathe a bit easier.

COPD is the umbrella term for chronic lung diseases, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is often marked by a chronic cough and shortness of breath. Treatment typically involves the use of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators to open airways and make breathing easier.

In a new study of 68 people with COPD, some got acupuncture, along with their daily medication, for three months. Others got a sham acupuncture treatment, in which the needles did not enter their skin. Those who received acupuncture along with their daily medication for three months were able to walk longer without becoming breathless, compared to those who got the sham acupuncture treatment.

The study appears online in the Archives of Internal Medicine. People who received real acupuncture also showed improvements in their quality of life and ability to exercise, according to researchers from Kyoto University and Meiji University of Integrative Medicine in Kyoto, Japan.

Many people with COPD have problems getting optimal nutrition because of their condition. The study showed that acupuncture may improve stomach function, making it easier for people with COPD to eat a healthy diet and maintain a normal weight.",1
"A new method for performing a “virtual” colonoscopy that requires less unpleasant preparation was shown in a new study to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps—and was a better experience for patients.

The second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. after lung cancer, colon cancer can be prevented if precancerous polyps—known as adenomas—are found and removed during a colonoscopy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if everyone 50 or older were regularly screened, as many as 60% of deaths could be avoided.

But Dr. Michael Zalis, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells the Health Blog that many people may avoid this procedure because the preparation, which requires patients to cleanse their colons with a laxative, is so unpleasant. In addition, some patients fear the instrument used in the procedure, or have concerns about the risks from anesthesia or of perforation of the bowel.

“No one should be dying from colon cancer, which is almost completely preventable with screening; and if it were sufficiently easy more people would do it,” says Zalis, lead author of the study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

In recent years, the use of computed tomographic colonography—known as CT or “virtual” colonoscopy—has eliminated the need for the most invasive part of the procedure. But though these virtual scans are performed externally, patients still have to take the laxatives so the scanning machines can read the empty colon.

So, the researchers developed a software program to electronically “cleanse” the bowel, Zalis says. Prior to a scan, researchers asked patients to adhere to a low-fiber diet for a few days and drink a special fluid to “tag” the colon’s contents. After performing the CT scan, the software electronically identified polyps.

The researchers screened 605 patients with the laxative-free CT scan and followed up with traditional colonoscopy to find out how successfully the virtual method detected precancerous polyps of six millimeters or more. The laxative-free scan accurately identified 91% of patients with polyps of 10 mm or larger -- those at highest risk of becoming cancerous -- but was less accurate for smaller lesions, the study says.

Dr. James Aisenberg, a gastroenterologist and clinical professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, agrees that, for some people, the laxative requirement can be a barrier to colorectal screening.

However, like virtual colonoscopy in general, laxative-free CTC “will miss a subset of precancerous polyps and thus is unlikely to become the gold standard for colorectal-cancer prevention,” says Dr. Aisenberg, who wasn’t involved with the study.

However, the laxative-free method “may become a useful alternative for persons who won't otherwise undergo screening, and is much better than no screening at all.”

Dr. Zalis and some of his co-investigators developed the software. The American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health and General Electric Co.’s health-care unit—which markets scanning devices and accessories—supported the researchers. Dr. Zalis says the company had no influence on the study.",1
"May 11, 2012 -- Starting your day off with an egg may help curb your appetite better than cereal, new research suggests.

In a small study, it took longer for people who ate eggs for breakfast to show signs of hunger than it did for those who had a bowl of ready-to-eat cereal.

Scientists suspect that egg protein may be better at making people feel full longer compared to the protein found in wheat.

For people hoping to shed some pounds, changing the type of protein in the diet, rather than the amount of it, is an idea the researchers think deserves more study as a weight loss strategy.

""This study shows that diets with higher protein quality may enhance satiety, leading to better compliance and success of a weight loss diet,"" researcher Nikhil Dhurandhar, PhD, says in a news release. He is an associate professor in the department of infection and obesity at the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La.

One large egg has about 70 calories, and it contains about 6 grams of protein, 5 grams of fat, and 186 milligrams of cholesterol.

The research was funded by the American Egg Board, and will be presented at the19th European Congress on Obesity in Lyon, France.",0
"News flash: Eggs are really good for you. This message was brought to you by the American Egg Board.

That’s right – the folks who sell eggs paid for a study that comes to the shocking conclusion that eggs are an ideal breakfast food. They could have just asked people if they liked eating eggs for breakfast.

Instead, they recruited 20 volunteers who were overweight or obese and assigned them to a week of either egg breakfasts or ready-to-eat cereal breakfasts. After a two-week gap, the groups were switched. Both types of breakfasts had the same number of calories, but the egg breakfasts contained “higher protein quality,” according to an abstract for the study, posted online here.

The folks who carried out this egg industry-funded research were from the Pennington Biomedical Research Center in Baton Rouge, La. This place conducts some serious research on diet and weight. So to assess whether people who ate egg breakfasts were better off than their counterparts who ate cereal, they took blood samples and measured the concentration of two key hunger hormones: acylated ghrelin (which stimulates hunger) and PYY3-36 (which is how the intestines let the brain know that you’re full). Sure enough, in the week when they ate eggs, volunteers had lower acylated ghrelin and higher PYY3-36 compared with the week when they ate cereal.

The researchers also treated the volunteers to four buffet lunches. They weren’t just being nice – researchers kept track of how much food everyone ate. They found that volunteers ate smaller lunches after they ate egg breakfasts compared with when they ate cereal breakfasts. The reason: They were less hungry.

The study was presented Saturday at the European Congress on Obesity in France by Nikhil Dhurandhar, a biochemist who studies obesity at Pennington. According to his website, Dhurandhar’s research usually focuses on viruses and other infectious agents that can cause obesity.

TUESDAY, May 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers have found new evidence showing that resveratrol, a compound found in red wine, may play a role in preventing cell aging.

The study in rodents found that when mice had a particular gene -- SIRT1 -- knocked out, or turned off, resveratrol had no effect on them. But tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal SIRT1 gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function.

Mitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function. A decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases, including diabetes and Alzheimer's disease, as well as to the aging process itself, said senior study author David Sinclair, a professor of genetics at Harvard Medical School in Boston.

But don't go reaching for that Chianti yet. Yes, resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes. But ""the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking 100 glasses of red wine a day,"" Sinclair said.

Instead, the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate SIRT1 and could be taken as medication. ""My colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging, not to extend lifespan, though that may be a side effect,"" Sinclair said.

The study is in the May 1 issue of Cell Metabolism.

While previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti-aging properties, the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial. Several studies, including work with yeast, worms and flies, have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and, in human cells, SIRT1 in particular.

But other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called AMPK, which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes.

Testing the effect of resveratrol on SIRT1 in mice was difficult, Sinclair said. Mice that have their SIRT1 gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments, he explained.

So Sinclair and two graduate students, Nathan Price and Ana Gomes, worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out SIRT1 in healthy adult mice.

""Our paper found you absolutely require the SIRT1 gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice,"" Sinclair said.

The paper also showed that the AMPK pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol, yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function. There was no effect on AMPK in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol.

Sinclair is co-founder and a consultant for Sirtris Pharmaceuticals Inc., which is developing resveratrol-like molecules for use as treatment for age-related diseases. In 2010, according to news reports, the company, which is owned by GlaxoSmithKline, halted clinical trials of resveratrol, but Sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules.

George Vlasuk, CEO of Sirtris, said the new findings offer the ""first definitive evidence"" for a direct link between SIRT1 and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol.

""The work by [first author] Price et al. strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at Sirtris, which focuses on the development of small-molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of SIRT1 as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging,"" Vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal.

Philippe Marambaud, an investigator at the Litwin-Zucker Center for Research in Alzheimer's Disease and Memory Disorders at the Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in Manhasset, N.Y, said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity.

""In this study, by using an elegant adult-inducible SIRT1 knock-out mouse model, the authors now provide compelling evidence that SIRT1 is required in vivo [in the animal] for the effect of resveratrol on AMPK activation and on mitochondrial function,"" Marambaud said.

While studies involving animals can be useful, they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans.

""A mouse model is not a human being, especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model, you want to be very careful,"" Marambaud said. ""This field has been extremely controversial. We should be very careful about claiming the importance of resveratrol for medical purposes. We have to wait and see, but this study is a big step forward.""

"If you had a history of suffering from migraines and could prevent the debilitating headaches by swallowing a few pills, you’d do it – wouldn’t you?

Actually, odds are you wouldn’t. Neurologists say that only about one-third of those who could benefit by migraine-preventing medication actually use it.

Preventive treatment involves taking a seizure drug and a beta-blocker every day to reduce the frequency, severity and duration of migraines. Neurologists estimate that about 38% of people who suffer from migraines stand to benefit with such a regimen, and studies suggest that as many as half of migraines can be prevented with drugs, according to Dr. Stephen D. Silberstein, a neurologist at the Jefferson Headache Center at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia. Silberstein was the lead author of new migraine treatment guidelines presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in New Orleans.

It would seem that migraineurs would be eager to stop these headaches before they start. In a summary of the guidelines written for patients and their families, this is how migraines are described:

Advertisement

“Migraine is a condition that involves recurring headaches. Each headache may last from four hours to two days. It can cause throbbing pain in the head. Other symptoms may include nausea (upset stomach), vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light or sound. Most people with migraine have attacks that happen repeatedly.”

Yuck.

People whose migraines are infrequent or mild may not be able to prevent them with drugs, the guidelines say. But for those who can, the best seizure drugs are divalproex sodium (Depakote), sodium valproate (Depakote, Depakene, Stavzor) and topiramate (Topamax or Topiragen). Beta-blockers are usually taken to treat high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias and other cardiovascular conditions, though metoprolol (Lopressor or Toprol), propranolol (Inderal) and timolol (Blocadren) can also help with migraines.

The authors also noted that frovatriptan (Frova), which is used to treat migraine symptoms, can also help prevent menstrual migraines.

These medications “are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity,” Silberstein and colleagues wrote in the new guidelines, which were based on a review of 284 publications.

In addition, an herbal remedy derived from a family of plants called Petasites or butterbur was found to be effective, according to the review.

The review identified a handful of drugs that “are probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention.” These include the antidepressants amitriptyline (Elavil, Endep or Vanatrip) and venlafaxine (Effexor); the beta blockers atenolol (Senormin or Tenormin) and nadolol (Corgard); and for menstrual migraines, naratriptan (Amerge) and zolmitriptan (Zomig).

“People need to keep in mind that all drugs, includingover-the-counter drugsand complementary treatments, can have side effects or interact with other medications, which should be monitored,” Silberstein said in a statement.

Five of the six co-authors of the new guidelines, including Silberstein, disclosed that they receive research funding, speaking fees and other payments from drug companies.

The guidelines will be published in Tuesday’s edition of the journal Neurology. They were developed in conjunction with the American Headache Society. You can read the new guidelines here, or check out the patient-friendly summary here.

"No one wants to hear that he or she has Alzheimer’s disease. But if the beta-amyloid plaques that are the disorder’s key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all, would you want to know? And since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofAlzheimer’s, who would pay for a costly test to detect it early -- and why?

Those questions are no longer hypothetical. Last week, the FDA approved an agent called Florbetapir F 18 injection (to be marketed as Amyvid), which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography (PET) scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function.

And on Monday, the American Academy of Neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a PET scan. The florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy’s “Emerging Science” program next week in New Orleans. Both Florbetapir F 18 and florbetaben help diagnose Alzheimer’s by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity, which can then be picked up by a PET scan.

Until recently, the diagnosis of Alzheimer’s disease could be made only after a patient’s death, when a pathologist could find physical evidence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles. A brain biopsy now can be used to detect Alzheimer’s plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of Alzheimer’s are densest. While diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection, accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away.

Advertisement

The FDA says that Amyvid “is not a test to predict the development of AD-associated dementia” in those who have no problematic symptoms. It’s an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether Alzheimer’s disease may be the cause. Among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment, about 60% have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely Alzheimer’s disease, said Dr. Michael W. Weiner of the Department of Veterans Affairs’ Center for Imaging of Neurodegenerative Diseases.

Weiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive Alzheimer’s research initiative of its kind, the Alzheimer’s Disease Neuroimaging Initiative. ADNI, a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects, is a five-year, $60-million project that will track 800 participants to compare how mental and daily-life skills, and the brain’s structure and function, change in those aging normally, those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia. Weiner conducted much of the research leading to Amyvid’s approval.

For now, says Weiner, there is “no consensus” on which patients should get the costly new PET scans that use Amyvid, and large insurers such as Medicare and Medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests. And some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is Alzheimer’s disease, said Weiner.

“But for many, when you take a person to the doctor, you usually want an answer, whether it leads to a treatment or not. This is a way of getting closer to an answer,” said Weiner. Many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques, he added.

Advertisement

With growing understanding that the changes of Alzheimer’s disease may be decades in the making, the value of early detection is gaining adherents, said Weiner. The “real game-changer,” he says, will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for Alzheimer’s disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress. Once that happens, physicians, researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost, and who will pay.",1

An experimental treatment for prostate cancer tumors using high-intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) shows promise as an effective treatment with fewer side effects than existing therapies.

The idea behind the new procedure is similar to lumpectomy in breast cancer patients, in which doctors remove only the tumors instead of the entire breast. Using HIFU, doctors can focus on treating only the cancer cells on the prostate while causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue. Unlike more common and invasive treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical removal of the prostate gland, HIFU may be able to avoid side effects like urine leakage and impotence.

(MORE: Circumcision: The Surgery that May Lower Prostate-Cancer Risk)

The new study, designed as a proof-of-concept study, involved just 41 men. Doctors used MRI and mapping biopsies to locate the cancerous tissues. They then focused high-energy sound waves on the affected area, causing the cancer cells to heat up to around 80°C, which kills the cells. None of the patients reported urinary incontinence a year after treatment, and only 1 in 10 suffered from poor erections. Overall, about 95% of the men were cancer-free after a full year following the trial.

“The signal from this study is quite strong,” study author Hashim Ahmed, a urologist at the University College London, told Bloomberg. “When you look at the current standard of care, there’s a 1-in-3, or 1-in-2 chance of having the perfect outcome. In this study, after 12 months, it’s a 9-in-10 chance.”

The men in the study were aged 45 to 80 with medium- to high-risk cancer, and would likely have undergone surgery or radiotherapy down the line. Men who had already received chemotherapy, hormone treatment or radiation therapy were excluded from the study. The procedure was carried out under general anesthesia and most of the patients had hospital stays of less than 24 hours after the treatment.

(MORE: Cancer Rates Decline Overall, but Obesity and Tanning Lead to Upticks)

“Focal therapy of individual prostate-cancer lesions, regardless of whether they are multifocal or unifocal, leads to a low rate of genitourinary side-effects and an encouraging rate of early freedom from clinically significant prostate cancer,” the authors concluded in the study.

Prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men. The National Cancer Institute estimates 241,740 new cases of prostate cancer this year in the U.S. and 28,170 deaths.

Ahmed told Bloomberg that HIFU may also be cheaper than other standard treatments, noting that the cost of the MRI and mapping was an estimated $2,400, plus about $1,600 for HIFU; in comparison, removing the prostate costs about $7,100. Fewer side effects would also lower other health care costs, he said.

(MORE: The Screening Dilemma)

The researchers are now recruiting more patients and seeking funding for larger studies. While the initial results were promising, they need to be replicated; HIFU also needs to be studied long-term and compared with other therapies. If the technology holds up, it could also work for other cell-based cancers like breast, thyroid, pancreas and liver, Ahmed said.

Largely due to its anti-inflammatory and anti-bacterial properties, the herb thyme -- which is found with other herbs in the produce section of most food stores -- may well earn itself a place in the skin care section of your local drug store.

Researchers from Leeds Metropolitan University in the U.K. steeped thyme, marigold, and myrrh in alcohol to make what's called a tincture, and then tested them on the bacteria that cause acne. They all had greater antibacterial effect after five minutes compared to lab specimens exposed to plain alcohol, but thyme was the most potent.

In fact, the thyme tincture was more powerful than standard concentrations of benzoyl peroxide, which is the active ingredient in many acne products. The new findings were presented at the Society for General Microbiology's Spring Conference in Dublin.

""If thyme tincture is proven to be as clinically effective as our findings suggest, it may be a natural alternative to current treatments,"" researcher Margarita Gomez-Escalada, PhD, says in a news release. ""The problem with treatments containing benzoyl peroxide is the side effects they are associated with,"" namely a burning sensation and skin irritation.

""Herbal preparations are less harsh on the skin due to their anti-inflammatory properties, while our results suggest they can be just as, if not more, effective than chemical treatments,"" she says.

WEDNESDAY, April 4, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Regularly consumption of food and drink rich in substances called flavonoids, such as berries, apples, tea and red wine, can lower a man's risk of developing Parkinson's disease by 40 percent, new research suggests.

For women, however, a reduction in risk was only seen when they ate at least several servings of berries a week, according to the study. Men also had a risk reduction from frequently eating berries.

""For total flavonoids, the beneficial result was only in men. But, berries are protective in both men and women,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Xiang Gao, a research scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health and an associate epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

""Berries could be a neuroprotective agent. People can include berries in their regular diet. There are no harmful effects from berry consumption, and they lower the risk of hypertension too,"" Gao added.

Results of the study are published online April 4 in the journal Neurology.

Parkinson's disease is a degenerative condition that affects the central nervous system. It causes movement disorders, such as tremors, rigidity and balance problems. About 500,000 Americans have Parkinson's disease, according to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke.

Flavonoids are substances found in plant foods that help prevent damage to the body's cells, known as oxidative damage. Anthocyanins are a type of flavonoid plentiful in such berries as strawberries and blueberries.

For the study, the researchers reviewed nutrition and health data from almost 50,000 men enrolled in the Health Professional Follow-Up Study and more than 80,000 women participating in the Nurses' Health Study.

The researchers looked at dietary intake of five major flavonoid sources: tea, berries, apples, orange juice and red wine.

Over 20 to 22 years of follow-up, 805 people developed Parkinson's disease -- 438 men and 367 women.

When researchers compared those who ate the most flavonoids with those who ate the least, they found that only men saw a statistically significant benefit, lowering their risk of Parkinson's by 40 percent.

Gao said it wasn't clear why only men benefited from the extra flavonoid intake, but he noted that other studies have also found differences between men and women. Gao said it's not clear if there's a biological mechanism causing these differences, or another factor.

But, when the researchers looked at the dietary compounds individually, it was clear that berries could benefit both men and women, lowering the risk of Parkinson's disease by about 25 percent for those who had at least two servings of berries a week.

Gao said that anthocyanins protect the cells from oxidative damage and they also have an anti-inflammatory effect, which may be how berries help to reduce Parkinson's risk.

The study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals, and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups. Also, recollections of dietary intake may be faulty, and it's possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results, the authors said.

Dr. Michael Okun, medical director of the National Parkinson Foundation, said, ""It is exciting to see research emerging about modifiable dietary issues that may affect the risk of getting diseases such as Parkinson's.""

But, he added, it's important for people to realize that this research isn't applicable to people who already have the disease.

He also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against Parkinson's disease.

"SATURDAY, March 31, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A noninvasive scan might someday help doctors track the progress of prostate cancer and help guide treatment, researchers report.

The imaging tool, known as a prostate cancer-specific radiotracer, has so far only been tested successfully in mice. But a team from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone.

Radiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients. Using positron emission tomography -- also known as a PET scan -- doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread.

In studies involving mice with prostate cancer, the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate-specific antigen (PSA), the same prostate cancer marker used in the PSA test. They found that the PSA gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone-based therapies.

The study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone. The researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions.

The findings were to be presented Saturday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting in Chicago, and are also being published in Cancer Discovery.

If used on people, the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors ""personalize"" treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease.

""The ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage, thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes,"" Michael J. Evans, research fellow in the Human Oncology and Pathogenesis Program at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, explained in meeting news release.

Encouraged by their findings, the study's authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year.

Two prostate cancer experts said the tool, if borne out in patients, could prove very useful.

Dr. Michael Schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at North Shore-LIJ Health System in Lake Success, N.Y. He noted that, as of now, doctors typically rely on results of the PSA blood test and/or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions.

Both methods have their limits and, ""while this study is very preliminary, if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients, it could become extremely useful in either the pre- or post-treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm,"" Schwartz said. ""It also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions.""

Dr. Erik Goluboff, an attending urologist at Beth Israel Medical Center, New York City, agreed that, ""this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect PSA-expressing tissues throughout the body.""

He believes that the new tool's ""greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in PSA expression in tissues as a result of various treatments. If a treatment showed a marked change, it could continue to be used in that patient, hence ""personalized"" medicine. If a specific change did not occur, that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead. Since these changes could not be detected based on a PSA blood test alone, this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient.""

However, Goluboff also noted that research from animal-based studies does not always pan out in humans and ""further, larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings.""

"HONG KONG (Reuters) - Boosting the effect of acupuncture needles with small electric currents may be effective in treating depression, a study in Hong Kong has found.

Led by Zhang Zhang-jin at the School of Chinese Medicine, University of Hong Kong, the researchers used electroacupuncture to stimulate seven spots on the heads of 73 participants, who had suffered several bouts of depression in the last 7 years.

The electroacupuncture was given in addition to medication that the patients were already taking and meant to augment their treatment, Zhang told a news conference.

Half the patients received electroacupuncture nine times over three weeks, while the other half - the placebo group - only had needles inserted superficially into their heads.

They were later assessed by experts for their depression levels and the group that received genuine electroacupuncture was found to be a lot happier.

“The drop (in depression scores) among the group receiving active treatment was more significant than the placebo group,” said Roger Ng, another researcher in the group, which published their findings in the journal PLoS (Public Library of Science) ONE.

“When the acupoints are stimulated, some brain centres responsible for producing serotonin are stimulated,” explained Ng, a consultant at the department of psychiatry at the Kowloon Hospital in Hong Kong.

An imbalance in serotonin levels is believed to be linked to depression. Depression affects about 20 percent of people at some point in their lives.

The World Health Organisation predicts that by 2020, depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world.

Zhang said his group may consider moving into another trial using only electroacupuncture on patients suffering milder depression.",0
"When roasted at 475 degrees, coffee beans are sometimes described as rich and full-bodied. But for the full-bodied person who is not so rich, unroasted coffee beans — green as the day they were picked — may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss, new research suggests.

In a study presented Tuesday at the American Chemical Society’s spring national meeting in San Diego, 16 overweight young adults took, by turns, a low dose of green coffee bean extract, a high dose of the supplement, and a placebo. Though the study was small, the results were striking: Subjects lost an average of 17.5 pounds in 22 weeks and reduced their overall body weight by 10.5%.

If green coffee extract were a medication seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration, these results would make it a viable candidate — more than 35% of subjects lost more than 5% of their body weight, and weight loss appeared to be greater while subjects were taking the pills than when they were on the placebo.

But as a dietary supplement, green coffee extract does not require the FDA’s blessing. In fact, it is already available as a naturopathic medicine and antioxidant.

Joe Vinson, the University of Scranton chemist who conducted the pilot study, said the findings should pave the way for more rigorous research on coffee bean extract’s effects. A larger trial involving 60 people is being planned.

Vinson, whose research focuses on plant polyphenols and their effects on human health, said it appears that green coffee bean extract may work by reducing the absorption of fat and glucose in the gut; it may also reduce insulin levels, which would improve metabolic function. There were no signs of ill effects on any subjects, Vinson reported Tuesday.

The study used a “cross-over” design, which allowed each subject to serve as his or her own comparison group. For six weeks, volunteers swallowed capsules three times a day, ingesting either 700 or 1,050 milligrams of green coffee extract a day or taking a placebo. After a two-week break, they moved, round-robin style, to another arm of the trial.

Subjects did not change their calorie intake over the course of the trial. But the more extract they consumed, the more weight and fat they lost. Altogether, they reduced their body fat by 16%, on average.

Of the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range.

One downside is that the extract is “extremely bitter.” It would be difficult to take without a lot of water, Vinson reported.

At roughly $20 per month, however, green coffee extract is much less expensive than any of the weight-loss medications available over the counter or by prescription.

The trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract.

The pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren’t involved in the research.

“This is certainly a provocative study,” said Dr. Gerald Weissmann, a physician and biochemist at New York University. But he said nutrition experts would want assurances that green coffee beans do not cause “malabsorption” within the human gut — a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition, heart arrhythmias and other problems because vitamins and minerals are not passing through the intestine.

Dr. Arthur Grollman, a pharmacologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said coffee beans contain about 250 different chemicals — some with positive and others with negative effects on human health. Though Vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss, Grollman said that claim needed further study. In the meantime, he said, consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do.

TUESDAY, March 27, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- When taken as a supplement, unroasted -- or green -- coffee-bean extract can help people shed pounds, according to a small preliminary study.

The research, which is being presented this week at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Diego, involved just 16 overweight and obese patients who were given daily doses of green coffee extract in capsule form.

All the patients were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits, while the study team monitored them for weight loss over a period of nearly six months.

The apparent result: Daily consumption of a small amount of green coffee extract translated into a nearly 11 percent drop in body weight, on average.

The study was conducted in India and funded by Applied Food Sciences, the American manufacturer of two green-coffee-extract products. It has not been published in a journal, and therefore has yet to undergo peer review.

Supplements of this kind, however, are not subject to the rigorous U.S. Food and Drug Administration safety and efficacy testing typically applied to all pharmaceutical medications.

""This was indeed a small study,"" acknowledged corresponding study author Joe Vinson, a professor of chemistry at the University of Scranton, in Pennsylvania, but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both France and Japan. ""Those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild weight loss. But here, with higher extract doses than have been used before, the patients experienced what I would call rather large weight loss.""

""While this of course needs to be confirmed with follow-up, I do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration,"" Vinson added.

Vinson said his team was not focused on the weight-loss impact of caffeine as much as that of unprocessed, unroasted coffee's primary ingredient: chlorogenic acid.

""That's the main natural compound in unroasted coffee, and roasted coffee has much, much less of it than unprocessed coffee,"" Vinson said. ""So we're not talking about something that is interchangeable with the coffee we drink,"" which is produced by roasting beans at a temperature between 464 and 482 degrees Fahrenheit.

Green coffee-bean extracts are sold online at prices ranging from about $10 to $20 for 60 capsules.

The study was broken into three six-week sections. In one section, study participants, who were all between the ages of 22 and 26, consumed a capsule filled with 700 milligrams of green coffee extract. In the second section, participants took a 1,050-milligram capsule. The third section had participants taking a placebo. Each patient ultimately cycled through each section.

While maintaining their pre-study dietary and exercise regimens, the patients lost an average of 17 pounds by the study's close. On average, patients lost 10.5 percent and 16 percent of their body weight and body fat, respectively.

""Basically, there was steady weight loss, without side effects, while the active green coffee extract was being taken at either dose,"" Vinson said.

A follow-up study involving 60 patients is now in the planning stages.

Lona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern in Dallas, cautioned that the study is short on specifics, making it difficult to draw any conclusions.

""First of all, you need more than 16 people to have any statistical significance attached to these findings,"" Sandon said. ""And we really have no idea how this might be working. For example, the patients were allowed to continue with their regular diet. But did this extract in any way influence their hunger and what they wanted to eat, and then what they actually ate? We don't know. What we have here is basically just a hypothesis that there's something about this compound that could be helpful.""

""Just because it might cause weight loss doesn't mean it's healthy,"" she warned. ""Because supplements are not regulated as drugs, they can be put on the market with no safety or efficacy testing. They don't even necessarily have to be tested for purity.""

""That means that in the past, various weight-loss supplements have been found to contain weight-loss drugs or other drugs at higher doses than what would be allowed in a prescription dose,"" Sandon added. ""So while people might have this perception that it's all natural since it's coming from a coffee bean, with supplements in general it's still a buyer-beware market.""

"March 19, 2012 (San Diego) -- Ultrasound treatment can reduce excessive sweating in the underarms by nearly 80%, according to a new study.

Researchers used a ''microfocused"" ultrasound to target the sweat glands in 14 men and women, aged 18 to 75, says Mark Nestor, MD, PhD, a dermatologist and voluntary associate professor of dermatology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

All had hyperhidrosis, a condition where a person sweats much more than the body needs to cool itself.

""Microfocused ultrasound appears to be effective and safe in the treatment of hyperhidrosis,"" Nestor says. It works, he says, by heating and destroying the sweat glands under the arm.

The sweating can occur even when the temperature is cool and the person is at rest. The armpits, palms, and soles are often affected.

He presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Dermatology.

Nestor received a research grant for the study from Ulthera, which makes the technology. The study was small and the findings are preliminary.",1
"March 15, 2012 -- A new prescription gel may quickly treat a common precancerous skin condition called actinic keratosis, a new study shows.

The gel is derived from the sap of the Euphorbia peplus plant. This has long been used as a folk remedy for skin lesions.

The new findings are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Actinic keratoses are typically red, scaly skin lesions that can over time develop into a type of skin cancer. They can often be found on sun-exposed areas of the body such as the face, scalp, arms, and legs.

The new gel, Picato (ingenol mebutate), is applied once daily for two or three days, depending on the area being treated. Other available topical treatments must be used for several weeks, and often irritate the skin. Cryotherapy, or freezing the affected skin area, is also used but can sometimes leave a scar.

Because the new gel is only used for a few days, any irritation is usually short-lived. The short duration also makes people more likely to stay the course, another advantage, according to the study's authors.

“The shorter application period is what makes ingenol mebutate a breakthrough in the treatment of actinic keratosis,” researcher Mark Lebwohl, MD, says in a news release. He is a professor and chair of the department of dermatology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.

The new study included 547 people with actinic keratoses on their face or scalp and 458 people with these lesions on their mid-section or arms and legs. Half got the new gel and the other half received an inactive placebo.

At the end of the two-month study, 42% of people in the first group and 34% of those in the second group who got the new gel showed complete clearance of their lesions. By contrast, only 4% and 5%, respectively, of the people who received the placebo had complete clearance.

The new study was funded by Picato manufacturer LEO Pharma.",0
"They don't call it ""The Big C"" for nothing. People don't even like to say the word out loud.

The good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do – or not do – in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen.

But a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer.

Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer.

It's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play.

First, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, ""The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin.""

This tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, ""The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection."" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment.

Why is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs – such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV – have been found in the prostate.

Participants in the study were asked about their family’s medical history, which may increase a man’s risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs.

Circumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth.

A few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV.

This gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results.

The bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.",1

MONDAY, March 12, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- People taking popular cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins may have a slightly lower risk than others of developing Parkinson's disease, new research suggests.

This effect may be even more pronounced among people younger than 60, according to the study published in the March issue of Archives of Neurology.

However, the risk reduction was modest and may have been due to chance, the authors said, noting that more research is warranted, especially because statins can cause adverse side effects.

""There is no clear verdict,"" said Dr. Stuart Isaacson, director of the Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders Center of Boca Raton, who was not involved in the study.

""Right now we don't have any good evidence that there is anything we can do to reduce the risk of developing Parkinson's disease, but research is ongoing,"" added Isaacson, also an associate professor of neurology at Florida International University's Herbert Wertheim College of Medicine in Miami.

For the study, researchers led by Dr. Xiang Gao, of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard University School of Public Health in Boston, analyzed data on more than 38,000 men and almost 91,000 women enrolled in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses' Health Study in 1994.

During 12 years of follow-up, 644 people were diagnosed with Parkinson's disease. People taking cholesterol-lowering drugs, especially those younger than 60, were less likely to develop the neurological disorder than those not using cholesterol drugs, the researchers found.

Nearly one million people in the United States have Parkinson's disease, a chronic and progressive movement disorder, and no one knows what causes it.

The researchers can't say exactly how -- or even if -- statins reduce the risk of Parkinson's. It's thought these drugs may have potent anti-inflammatory effects, which could protect the brain.

The study had some limitations, the authors acknowledged. For example, only about 70 percent of people who were taking drugs to lower cholesterol were actually on statins at the study's start.

Dr. Roy Alcalay, an assistant professor of neurology at Columbia University Medical Center in New York City, said it is way too early to say that statins lower risk for Parkinson's disease. ""This is a promising avenue for future research,"" said Alcalay, an advisor for the Parkinson's Disease Foundation.

But there is some good news, he added. The data are compelling evidence that statins are not detrimental for people with or at risk of Parkinson's disease, he said. There was a concern that statins could be harmful as they might lower the level of coenzyme Q10 in the blood. Co-Q10, an antioxidant, is thought to have benefits for people with Parkinson's disease.

""If you need to be on statins for your heart, it is not going to increase your risk for Parkinson's,"" Alcalay said.

"Food allergies are tricky business. They're on the rise in the United States and no one knows why.

Some children are allergic to many foods, and it's impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction. And so far there's no cure.

Researchers at Johns Hopkins University and Duke University are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them life-threatening reactions. It's still in the early stages, but Dr. Robert Wood of Johns Hopkins, who has been on the forefront of food allergy research, estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years.



In his new study, researchers explored a treatment for children with cow's milk allergies. The strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen (milk). Oral immunotherapy, swallowing small amounts of the allergen, has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy, which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the person's tongue.

Wood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with 30 children ages 6 to 18. These kids were severely allergic to cow's milk. Wood presented the study, published in the Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, at the 2012 Annual Meeting of the American Academy of Allergy, Asthma & Immunology this weekend.

The results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy. Still, it did not eliminate all symptoms.

This is particularly important, because about 20% of the kids that Wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible, Wood said.

Some participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies, Wood said. But only one-third have longterm protection. Others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions.

""With milk that’s not too hard,"" Wood says, because one could ""eat pizza a couple of times a week.""

It's not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults, since there have been so few participants in this research. The big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding, Wood said.

This is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy, Wood said.

Other research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies. But tree nuts may be harder to treat, Wood said, because tree-nut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they can't eat.

Researchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab (Xolair), approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of severe asthma, to see if it could help people with food allergies, too.

Do not try the immunotherapy technique at home; these experiments are conducted under medical supervision.",1

Omega-3s may help retain brainpower

THE QUESTION Eating fish can be good for the heart, thanks to the presence of omega-3 fatty acids. Might fish consumption help the brain, too?

THIS STUDY involved 1,575 adults who averaged 67 years old and had no signs of dementia and had not had a stroke. They were given MRI brain scans and a battery of tests to measure memory and thinking abilities; they also had blood drawn to check the level of omega-3 fatty acids in their red blood cells. Those with the lowest levels of omega-3s showed signs of accelerated aging. They had lower brain volume, indicating shrinkage comparable to two additional years of aging. Compared with those with the highest blood levels of omega-3s, they scored lower on cognitive tests measuring such things as memory, problem solving, abstract thinking and multi-tasking.

WHO MAY BE AFFECTED? Middle-aged and older adults. Omega-3 fatty acids are unsaturated fats found in most fish, but especially in fatty fish that live in cold seawater, such as salmon and herring. Except for trout, freshwater fish usually are lower in omega-3s.

CAVEATS Most participants were white. Testing and measurements were done once, providing no data for comparison over time or to determine any link to dementia.

"People with diets short on omega-3 fatty acids – the kind found in fish oil – were more likely to experience accelerated brain aging, a new study found.

“People with lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids had lower brain volumes that were equivalent to about two years of brain aging,” said Dr. Zaldy S. Tan, a member of the UCLA Easton Center for Alzheimer’s Disease Research in the Department of Neurology.

The study was published Tuesday in the print edition of the journal Neurology.

Tan and his colleagues compared blood levels of two nutrients in omega-3 fatty acids with MRI brain scans and cognitive tests. They found people in the bottom 25% scored lower on such mental tests as problem solving, multi-tasking and abstract thinking.

Tan said the MRI images showed those with lower levels of omega-3 fatty acids were also more likely to have minute but significant structural changes in the brain. The MRIs showed higher white matter hyperintensity volume, tiny lesions in the brain, raising the risk for death, stroke and dementia for the low omega-3 fatty acids group.

Tan said the results were consistent with signs of damage to the intricate network of blood vessels in the brain. A third of the brain by volume is composed of blood vessels.

Tan’s team studied 1,575 people with an average age of 67 who were free of dementia. They controlled for such risk factors as age, smoking, gender, body mass index, physical activity and APOE, the one known gene linked to dementia risk.

Tan said the next step in the research is to follow these people to see if the risk factors they observed translates into a higher rate of cognitive deterioration.

Fatty fish like salmon offer a concentrated source of the omega-3 fatty acid nutrients Tan and his colleagues looked at eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).

Vegetable and canola oils, soybeans, flaxseed, walnuts and vegetables including spinach, kale and salad greens are also a source of omega-3 fatty acids. These contain alpha-linolenic acid (ALA), which the body partially converts to EPA and DHA.

Both types are thought to be beneficial. The typical American diet doesn't contain enough of either. Choose My Plate, the government’s dietary guidelines, recommends eating seafood twice a week.

“This is an important new finding that supports omega-3 for brain health and brain size,” said Dr. Majid Fotuhi, chairman of the Neurology Institute for Brain Health and Fitness and assistant professor of neurology at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine.

Fotuhi recommends his patients get 1,000 mg per day of DHA, a nutrient that increases blood flow in the brain, reduces inflammation in the brain, heart and elsewhere, and reduces the toxic aggregation of amyloid in the brain.

DHA has the added benefit of improving mood and reducing symptoms of depression, he said. The only people who should avoid DHA are patients on a blood thinner like Cumadin, he added.

When it comes to infertility, the burden seems to often fall on women. They’re poked and prodded and scoped in an effort to figure out what’s complicating conception.

While it’s just as likely that infertility is related to the male half of the couple, only 20% of men in duos struggling to make a baby get a sperm-count analysis early on or at all, according to data from SpermCheck Fertility, which earlier this month announced the availability of its at-home screening test for men. SpermCheck, which is approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, assesses sperm count with 98% accuracy in 10 minutes and does away with the unpleasantness of conjuring up a sperm sample in a doctor’s office. As SpermCheck’s website puts it, a “trip to a fertility clinic for a semen analysis is not for everyone. These tests can be expensive (costing hundreds of dollars and not typically covered by insurance), inconvenient and are often embarrassing.”

Low sperm count, or oligospermia, is a main cause of male infertility. By addressing the issue, SpermCheck will join a crowded infertility market that includes more than 20 types of female-fertility tests in Walgreen stores alone. For women who are having trouble getting pregnant, the test may very well be one they — and not their squeamish partners — snap up along with over-the-counter ovulation kits.

“In our society, the woman carries the burden of trying to determine the issues surrounding infertility,” Ray Lopez, CEO of SpermCheck, told Bloomberg News. “Men don’t say, ‘Let me go to the urologist and give a semen sample.’” That reluctance has created a $440 million-a-year market for male fertility tests in the U.S., Lopez says.

The test reveals whether sperm count appears normal, at 20 million or more sperm per ml; lower than that indicates a trip to the doctor is pretty much unavoidable. Stores will begin stocking the $39.99 test in April; until then, men — or their partners — can find it online at www.Walgreens.com and www.CVS.com.

It relies on scrutiny of a particular protein found only in the head of mature sperm; the protein was discovered by John Herr, director of the Center of Cell Biology at the University of Virginia and the chairman of SpermCheck. “This at-home test was created to meet the needs of couples who are considering and just planning on starting a family, those currently having trouble conceiving,” says Herr, and “even those men who are just curious about their sperm count.”

Would-be virile men “just curious” about their sperm count? Hard to believe. And yet, assuming fertility aids of some sort successfully pave the way to parenthood, SpermCheck could also prove of some use at the other end of the spectrum: the company also manufactures a do-it-yourself test for postvasectomy screening.

"For women in their 50s and 60s, the benefits of getting regular mammograms clearly outweigh the risks. But the picture isn't so clear for women in their 40s.

""What we are seeing is that women with mammogram -detected breast cancer require less treatment,"" Malmgren tells WebMD. ""They get more breast -conserving surgery and less chemotherapy .""

The finding comes from a careful study of nearly 2,000 women diagnosed with first-time breast cancer at age 40 to 49. The women were carefully followed since their diagnosis in 1990 to 2008, says study co-leader Judith A. Malmgren, PhD, president of Seattle's HealthStat Consulting.

Feb. 22, 2012 -- When women in their 40s get breast cancer , their tumors need less intense treatment and recur less often if they were first detected during routine mammogram screening.

Mammograms in 40s

The U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) says there is no proof that the benefits of routine mammogram screening outweigh the risks for average-risk women in their 40s. The American Cancer Society (ACS) still recommends that women start screening in their 40s -- but only if they are fully aware of the possible harms as well as the possible benefits.

Even the USPSTF accepts the fact that beginning breast cancer screening at age 40 saves lives. It cuts the death rate in these women by about 15%, says Otis Brawley, MD, chief medical officer for the ACS.

""Let's say 10,000 women in the world were going to die of breast cancer that developed in their 40s,"" Brawley tells WebMD. ""If all those women were screened in their 40s, only 8,500 would die.""

But the vast majority of women will never develop breast cancer during their 40s. These women will suffer the harms of early screening.

""The issue is, how many women are going to have to be called back because of abnormal mammogram findings?"" Brawley says. ""How many women are going to end up getting biopsies and then learn they don't have breast cancer? And a certain proportion of women are going to be so inconvenienced so many times with the mammograms they got in their 40s that they will walk away from it in their 50s and 60s when it is a much better test.""",1
"A new study has found that consumption of omega-3 fatty acids from fish is associated with a reduced risk for one kind of colon polyp, but only in women.

Animal studies have suggested that omega-3 fatty acids may have anti-cancer effects, but the results from human epidemiological studies have been inconclusive. For this case-control study, researchers recruited 5,307 colonoscopy patients, 60 percent of them men, at two Tennessee hospitals over a seven-year period ending in April 2010. The analysis appears online in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition.

They found 2,141 people with polyps, leaving 3,166 polyp-free controls. All patients were interviewed about diet, health habits and medical history.

After controlling for age, race, body mass index, smoking and other factors, the researchers found that women in the highest fifth for omega-3 consumption — those who consumed three or more servings of fish a week — were 33 percent less likely than women in the lowest fifth to have adenomatous polyps, a type likely to become cancerous.

The researchers found no effect in men, and no effect of omega-3 consumption on hyperplastic polyps, which are more likely to be benign.

“This is more evidence to suggest that omega-3s are beneficial and may have anti-inflammatory action helpful in reducing cancer risk,” said the lead author, Dr. Harvey J. Murff, an associate professor of medicine at Vanderbilt.",1
"Weight-Loss Drugs Face High Hurdles At FDA

Tammy Wade knew she had to try something else to lose weight when she stepped on the scale and saw the number: 203 pounds.

Wade, 50, of McCalla, Ala., is only 5 feet 3 inches tall. She had tried everything. Nothing worked.

""I had problems with my feet and ankles, and they were saying I was borderline diabetic,"" Wade says. ""I'm like, well, I gotta do something, you know. So, I needed, really did need to lose the weight.""

So Wade volunteered to help test Qnexa, an experimental drug pending before the Food and Drug Administration. She quickly noticed a big difference.

""I didn't feel ravenous, and I didn't want to snack all day long,"" she says.

Over the next year, Qnexa helped Wade slowly drop about 40 pounds, and keep it off for another year. ""It makes you feel so much better,"" Wade says. ""Your back don't hurt, your feet don't hurt.""

But the FDA rejected Qnexa in 2010 because of concerns about side effects, especially possible heart problems and birth defects.

FDA Briefing Documents Released Update Feb. 17, 10:30 a.m.: The FDA posted a 200-page review of the possible risks and benefits of Qnexa on the agency's website. The review noted continued concerns that Qnexa can increase the risk for several possible side effects, including increased heart rate, birth defects and thinking problems such as memory lapses and confusion. But the agency also noted Qnexa does appear to help many people lose at 5 percent of their body weight, In addition, it was ""somewhat reassuring"" that the drug also appears to produce some health benefits beyond weight loss, including lower blood pressure. Among the questions the agency plans to ask an advisory committee meeting Feb. 22 to review the drug, is whether Vivus Inc., which makes Qnexa, should conduct a study better assessing the drug's affect on the heart before the drug is approved. In its own 166-page review, Vivus called Qnexa a ""significant advancement in the medical treatment of obesity"" and detailed the potential benefits of the drug. The company also outlined a plan to minimize the chances that women of childbearing age would take it.

Qnexa's rejection came amid a flurry of failed attempts by drug companies to win approvals of new weight-loss drugs. The setbacks put a spotlight on how the FDA handles these drugs.

Even though obesity is at epidemic levels, the FDA hasn't approved any new weight-loss medicines since 1999.

""We have two-thirds of all Americans who are overweight or obese, and the costs are nearing $150 billion a year,"" says Christine Ferguson, a health policy professor at George Washington University. ""The sheer magnitude of the problem really requires us to address it more aggressively and thoughtfully than we have.""

Ferguson has been helping to organize a series of meetings involving public health experts, anti-obesity advocates, government officials and others to try to figure out what the FDA should do.

""We actually have this huge gap,"" says Joe Nadglowski of the Obesity Action Coalition, who has been participating in the meetings. ""We go from Weight Watchers to bariatric surgery. And the fact that there isn't ... medical treatments for obesity, including pharmaceuticals, really is a challenge, considering how big the problem is in this country.""

Part of what's going on is that the FDA has gotten a lot more cautious about approving new drugs in general after some serious drug-safety problems, such as heart problems linked to the painkiller Vioxx.

The FDA has been especially tough on weight-loss drugs because of previous problems with those drugs, such as the diet drug cocktail fen-phen.

""There's been a long history with obesity drugs that we've had to take off the market. You recall the fen-phen episode where a significant number of people got heart-valve defects,"" says Janet Woodcock, a top FDA official.

Woodcock argues that the agency has to be extra-careful with weight-loss drugs, because chances are it won't just be obese people taking them.

""When you're talking about a drug where it could go into literally tens of millions of Americans, there has to be attention to safety,"" Woodcock says.

What might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster, she says.

But some say the agency's aversion to accepting any risks is outdated. They say the FDA wrongly still tends to view weight-loss drugs as diet pills — something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes.

""We are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress. We're talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity,"" Nadglowski says.

So Nadglowski and others are pushing the FDA to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss, such as reducing the risk for heart disease, diabetes and other complications of obesity.

Woodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently.

As the FDA works through this, many are watching how the agency handles Qnexa. An FDA advisory panel is scheduled to review Qnexa again on Feb. 22.

Barbara Troupin of Vivus, the company that is developing Qnexa, says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight.

""We see decreases in blood pressure. We see decreased rates of progression to diabetes. We see improvements in sleep apnea. We see improvements in quality of life. Pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits,"" she says.

Vivus hopes the FDA will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks, including the concerns about birth defects. The company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared. Vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it.

Some see Qnexa as a test of the FDA trying to recalibrate how it weighs risks and benefits for weight-loss drugs.

For her part, Wade just wants to be able to start taking it again. She's gained back half of the weight she lost.

""I need to lose 20 more pounds again,"" she says. ""And I need the help.""",1

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 15, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- The quit-smoking drug Chantix may also help problem drinkers cut their alcohol consumption, a small new study suggests.

Exactly how this drug curbs drinking is not fully understood, but its use may increase blood pressure, heart rate and feelings of sadness and nausea, thereby blunting the pleasurable effects of alcohol, the researchers said.

""Chantix might reduce alcohol consumption by reducing overall enjoyment of the alcohol drinking experience,"" said study author Emma Childs, a research associate at the University of Chicago.

""Chantix increased the unpleasant effects of alcohol, for example feeling drowsy and irritable, [and] participants also reported that they didn't like the alcohol effects as much,"" Childs said.

Approved to help smokers quit in 2006, Chantix (varenicline) has its share of potential side effects. In July 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration mandated that Chantix carry a ""black box"" warning about the potential risks of depression and suicidal thoughts. Recently, the drug was linked to a small but significant risk of heart attack and stroke among people with pre-existing heart disease. Chantix costs roughly $3 per pill.

The results of the new study were released online in Alcoholism: Clinical & Experimental Research prior to publication in the May print issue.

The study included 15 healthy participants who took part in six sessions. They received a 2-mg dose of Chantix and an inactive placebo, followed three hours later by a beverage containing either a placebo, a low dose of alcohol, or a high dose of alcohol.

Before and after the sessions, the researchers asked the participants about their mood, tested visual ability and measured physiological responses such as blood pressure and heart rate.

The participants found the Chantix-booze combination increased the unpleasant effects of alcohol and reduced the rewarding aspects of drinking.

Whether the drug might someday be approved to help problem drinkers cut back remains to be seen, said the researchers, who acknowledged that the study's small size is a limitation.

""We are not currently performing any studies with Chantix, although other groups are actively pursuing this line of research with a view to developing Chantix as an aid to people wanting to quit or cut down their drinking,"" Childs said.

Dr. Ihsan Salloum, professor of psychiatry and director of the alcohol and drug abuse treatment program at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, termed the study encouraging.

Noting that new ways of treating alcoholism are much needed, Salloum said that Chantix may have a niche among smokers with alcohol-dependence issues. ""We need a lot more options in terms of medicines to help curb drinking,"" he said. ""We have many options for depression and need more for alcoholism, considering it is one of the most common diseases around the world.""

More research is needed, he noted, but ""this medication may be helpful for people with a drinking problem who are also smokers.""

The study was funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and the U.S. National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism.

"We've long known that the Mediterranean diet is good for the heart. Now, it may be good for the brain as well.

A study published in this month's issue of the Archives of Neurology found that the diet might protect against blood-vessel damage in the brain, reducing the risks of stroke and memory loss.

It's the first study to specifically examine the effects of the diet centered around vegetables, fruits, fish, whole grains, nuts, olive oil and a moderate amount of alcohol, with limited consumption of red meat, sweets and refined grains like white bread or white rice—on the brain's small blood vessels.

Previous studies have suggested adhering to a Mediterranean-style diet is associated with a lower risk of heart disease, stroke and cognitive disorders like Alzheimer's disease.

In the latest study, researchers, led by a group at the University of Miami in Florida and Columbia University in New York, analyzed food questionnaires filled out by nearly 1,000 people participating in a larger, ongoing Northern Manhattan Study. These participants were categorized into groups based on how closely they adhered to an ideal Mediterranean-style diet, said Clinton Wright, one of the researchers and an associate professor of neurology at Miami's Miller School of Medicine.

Researchers then used magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scans of the brain to look for what are called white matter hyperintensities, which show up as small lesions on the scan and indicate damage to small blood vessels. The damaged blood vessels can cause small so-called silent strokes with no immediate symptoms but which over time can affect cognitive performance.

Broadly, the study showed that people with the highest Mediterranean diet scores had the lowest white-matter volume burden.

Researchers also found that the type of fat appeared to matter. Those who consumed more monounsaturated fat, which is found in olive oil, had lower white-matter hyperintensity volumes on their brain scans.

Dr. Wright cautioned that the study doesn't prove that a Mediterranean-style diet causes less brain damage and said more study is needed. But he said it indicates that the diet might be protective of small blood vessels in the brain.

"Feb. 13, 2012 -- A new stem cell treatment resurrects dead, scarred heart muscle damaged by a recent heart attack.

The finding, just in time for Valentine's Day, is the clearest evidence yet that literally broken hearts can heal. All that's needed is a little help from one's own heart stem cells.

""We have been trying as doctors for centuries to find a treatment that actually reverses heart injury,"" Eduardo Marban, MD, PhD, tells WebMD. ""That is what we seem to have been able to achieve in this small number of patients. If so, this could change the nature of medicine. We could go to the root of disease and cure it instead of just work around it.""

Marban, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, led the study. He invented the ""cardiosphere"" culture technique used to create the stem cells and founded the company developing the treatment.

It's the first completed, controlled clinical trial showing that scarred heart tissue can be repaired. Earlier work in patients with heart failure, using different stem cells or bone-marrow stem cells, also showed that the heart can regenerate itself.

""These findings suggest that this therapeutic approach is feasible and has the potential to provide a treatment strategy for cardiac regeneration after [heart attack],"" write University of Hong Kong researchers Chung-Wah Siu and Hung-Fat Tse. Their editorial accompanies the Marban report in the Feb. 14 advance online issue of The Lancet.",1
"If all goes well for award-winning Plainfield inventor Matt Reavill, his new device will help save lives, decrease health care costs — and employ disabled veterans to boot.



Reavill won a prestigious contest in London late last year called the OmniCompete Health Pitch Battlefield, whose independent judges said his invention is a simple way to catheterize the heart. It reduces risks to an ""absolute minimum"" by moving the catheter insertion to the arm, the judges said, replacing a complex wire-guided procedure through the neck, which is typically used to monitor the heart during a hospital stay for very ill patients.



His breakthrough was also chosen by hospital-based clinical experts to participate in the 2010 Innovation Celebration, a national program run by Premier, a hospital-owned group purchasing organization. Premier Chief Operating Officer Mike Alkire says the products selected have the potential to improve safety and quality while cutting the cost of health care.



Reavill plans to hire 13 to 20 disabled vets to get the production off the ground — with the goal of hiring up to 18,000 if the device goes national. He recently procured a bank loan agreement and is hoping the award recognition and hospitals' willingness to try the catheter will attract a venture capitalist.



Called the ReavillMED CV, the Food and Drug Administration-cleared device includes a catheter called a PICC line, IV tubing that sheathes it to provide sterility, and a transducer that can directly measure blood pressure to help determine needed fluid levels. The catheter is inserted into the arm and travels to the heart within 20 to 30 seconds via the bloodstream. Traditional heart catheterization through a vein in the neck can take 20 minutes or longer.



Reavill likes to say it's ""stupidly simple"" because the individual parts have been around for decades, but no one had thought of this particular configuration before.



""It's old technologies put together in a different way to enable established medical treatments to be done earlier,"" Reavill says.



It remains to be seen whether that saved time will result in saved lives. But because it's self-contained, the catheter theoretically should provide little margin for contamination that can lead to infection. It can be inserted in a nonsterile environment such as an emergency room.



In 1994, Reavill says, his father survived a complicated angioplasty with a high mortality rate, only to die three weeks later of a staph infection that was caused by a central line catheter inserted into his heart through a neck vein.



A venous heart catheter inserted through the neck, the traditional approach, requires painstaking preparation of the insertion area and a ""pseudo-operative field,"" says Dr. Andrew Dennis, attending surgeon at Stroger Hospital's trauma and burn units and a clinical researcher.



Dennis believes the ReavillMED CV shows a ""tremendous amount of promise,"" and he wants to test the first 50 catheters Reavill can provide. If the device lives up to expectations, the hospital will probably use it in patient resuscitation, Dennis said. He also plans to research whether quicker central venous catheterization improves patient resuscitation efforts.



Dennis adds that the catheter could prove useful in patients with sepsis, or blood poisoning, which strikes about 750,000 Americans every year. Of those, between 28 and 50 percent die, according to the National Institute of General Medical Sciences.



""Once a person presents with septic shock, the catheter is an early aid that can guide the way a patient is managed,"" Dennis says. ""You get an objective number and it becomes less art, less gestalt and more evidence-based.""



Southern Illinois Healthcare, a three-hospital system that is considering use of Reavill's catheter, has a team of specially trained nurses who install catheters in the neck, says Dr. James Miller, chief medical officer. The nurses have a success rate in the ""high 90s,"" Miller says, but ""very few"" hospitals have devoted the time or resources to create the discipline.



Reavill says he may be proudest of his intention to hire disabled veterans in southern Illinois, a hard-hit region economically. He plans to bear the cost of any prostheses the veterans need to work on the catheters.



Reavill grew up on a pig farm in Robinson, in southeastern Illinois, and attended Southern Illinois University, which is supporting the development of the device.



""My wife's family is from southern Illinois, too, so it's home,"" Reavill says.",1
"Feb. 6, 2012 -- You may have heard about brown fat -- a unique type of fat that acts like a furnace in the body to burn calories instead of storing them as excess weight.

Adults don’t have much brown fat, but a new study suggests that hormones produced by the heart just might help them make more.

Researchers found that the hormones, known as cardiac natriuretic peptides, caused regular energy-storing white fat cells to turn into energy-burning brown fat in mice.

If studies show the same thing in humans, the heart hormone may hold the key to an effective weight loss treatment, says researcher Sheila Collins, PhD, of Sanford-Burnham Medical Research Institute in Orlando, Fla.

The study appears online in the Journal of Clinical Investigation.

“These hormones are involved in fluid regulation, but we showed in this study that they also play a role in breaking down fat,” she says.",1
"Feb. 1, 2012 -- A new drug appears to be effective for shrinking uterine fibroids and controlling the heavy menstrual bleeding they often cause, according to new research from Europe.

In one study, the drug ulipristal acetate proved to be much more effective than a placebo for shrinking the non-malignant uterine tumors.

In another, ulipristal acetate was found to be as effective as monthly injections of the drug Lupron for reducing heavy bleeding in women with uterine fibroids.

Both studies appear in the Feb. 2 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine.

Ulipristal acetate is the active chemical in the emergency contraceptive sold in the U.S. as Ella, but the daily doses taken by the fibroid patients in the studies were much smaller than those in the contraceptive.

If trials now under way in the U.S. prove positive, New Jersey-based Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc. and Swiss-based PregLem hope to market ulipristal acetate as a fibroid treatment under the trade name Esmya, says Watson spokesman Charlie Mayr.",1
"The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the first therapy to treat an underlying cause of cystic fibrosis, a pill that targets a genetic mutation affecting a small minority of patients suffering from the life-threatening breathing disorder.

The drug, Kalydeco, from Vertex Pharmaceuticals Inc., VRTX 0.14% will be among the most expensive therapies on the market, costing $294,000 a year.

Cystic fibrosis causes the body to produce an unusually thick, sticky mucus that clogs the lungs and obstructs the pancreas and stops enzymes from helping the body break down and absorb food. Patients are prone to infections and progressively lose the ability to breathe.

Until Tuesday's approval of Kalydeco, the 30,000 cystic fibrosis patients in the U.S. and 100,000 world-wide could take medicines that only tackled the symptoms of the disease, such as antibiotics to treat the infections. Patients typically spent a few hours each day wearing vibrating vests to dislodge mucus build-up.

The medicine is a pill meant to be taken twice daily with fat-containing food. It was approved to treat patients who have a mutation in a gene that causes cystic fibrosis in about 4% of CF patients, some 1,200 people in the U.S.

The mutation, called G551D, is in a gene called the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator. The CFTR gene regulates the transport of chloride and water in the body. Kalydeco helps the protein made by the CFTR gene function better, which improves lung function and improves other side effects of cystic fibrosis.

""Now I'm nervous about growing old,"" said Emily Schaller, a 29-year-old from Trenton, Mich., who has been taking the pills as part of clinical trials since late 2009 and has since run five half-marathons. ""I've never been more hopeful.""

Kalydeco comes with one of the most expensive price tags for a medicine, according to Lawrence Marsh, a Barclays Capital analyst. He said more expensive drugs include Soliris, which treats a blood disorder and costs $409,500 a year, and Elaprase, which treats a potentially fatal condition that causes mental retardation and costs $375,000 a year.

Like Kalydeco, these drugs tend to provide significant improvements for a small number of patients. For that reason, health plans tend to cover the cost.

Jeff Leiden, who becomes Vertex's chief executive on Wednesday, said the pricing reflects the value the drug provides, the small number of patients indicated for it, and the company's hefty investment in developing cystic fibrosis treatments.

It is ""hard to make these drugs. It takes hundreds of people working over a number of years and hundreds of millions of dollars, and it's all at risk"" of not succeeding, Dr. Leiden said in an interview.

Vertex plans to provide some financial assistance to patients. After $15 a month, for instance, it will pay up to 30% of the drug's cost—as much as $88,000 a year—for eligible patients who are commercially insured but facing high co-pays or co-insurance costs, a spokesman said. The company will also assign a case manager to each patient to help guide them through financial issues.

Kalydeco was approved for use in patients six-years-old and older. It was approved in about three months and ahead of an April deadline, according to FDA and the company. The company is planning a study of the drug in patients between two years and five years old.

TUESDAY, Jan. 17, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Combining two drugs that target an aggressive type of breast cancer known as HER2-positive appears to work better than using either drug alone, researchers report.

The dual-drug approach greatly boosted the chances of eliminating microscopic signs of early cancer by the time a woman was due to have surgery, said researcher Dr. Jose Baselga, chief of hematology/oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center and a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School.

The study was published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet.

The two drugs are Tykerb (lapatinib) and Herceptin (trastuzumab). Using both together resulted in a 51 percent response, compared with a 30 percent response in women given Herceptin alone. Those given Tykerb alone had a 25 percent response.

""What we observed was a massive improvement in response,"" Baselga said.

GlaxoSmithKline, the maker of Tykerb, helped fund the study.

""Lapatinib was approved for advanced breast cancer in 2007,"" Baselga said. ""The question we had was, what is the efficacy if we give it in early-stage breast cancer prior to surgery?""

Baselga and his colleagues conducted a trial treating 455 women from 23 countries. All had HER2-positive breast cancers. All had tumors larger than about three-fourths of an inch.

In HER2-positive breast cancer, test results are positive for a protein called human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, which promotes cancer cell growth.

In the study, 154 women got Tykerb, 149 Herceptin and the other 152 both drugs. All had the drug regimen before surgery, with Taxol (paclitaxel), a standard chemotherapy, added after six weeks. After 12 more weeks of treatment, the women had surgery.

At that point, researchers evaluated who had better responses. The women continued the treatments for one more year, allowing researchers to follow them and see how the approaches affected survival.

Baselga stressed that the study looked only at women with early-stage HER2-positive breast cancers, and that the drug Tykerb is approved now only for advanced breast cancers.

The study is well done and important, said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. The two drugs, he said, ""affect the same pathway but do it in a different way.""

While the combination showed a better response rate, ""there is also an increased level of side effects,"" he noted.

While no major heart problems occurred, those on Tykerb alone or the two-drug combination had more diarrhea. Liver-enzyme alterations were also more frequent when Tykerb was used.

GlaxoSmithKline notes that liver toxicity with the drug may be severe and that deaths have been reported, although the cause of the deaths has not been determined.

The important question, however, has not been answered yet, Lichtenfeld said. That's the effect on overall survival in using the two-drug approach. The researchers are continuing to evaluate that.

Cost is another consideration: Tykerb runs about $4,000 a month wholesale, and retail prices could be higher.

In another study, published online Jan. 17 in The Lancet Oncology, researchers from Germany reported that Tykerb is less beneficial than Herceptin as a single-drug therapy.

They assigned 620 women with HER2-positive breast cancer to get standard chemotherapy plus Herceptin or Tykerb.

They looked to see which drug was better at eliminating invasive cancer in the breast and metastatic cells in the lymph nodes. While 30 percent of those in the Herceptin group had this response, 23 percent of the Tykerb group did. The study was funded by drug makers GlaxoSmithKline, Roche and Sanofi-Aventis.

Baselga reports receiving honoraria from Roche; other co-authors report receiving speaking fees or honoraria from GlaxoSmithKline and fees from other drug companies.

"Since her teens, Lesa Merlo, of Hinsdale, had learned to compensate as her hearing declined. She used the television's closed-captioning feature. She read lips and paid attention to body language. Often, it meant only being able to do one thing at a time, explained the mother of three young children.



Now, thanks to an implant called Esteem, Merlo can multitask. ""I can make dinner and supervise homework at the same time,"" she said. ""I don't have to stop and look directly at the children. I can hear what they're saying behind my back.""



Unlike a hearing aid, which amplifies sounds, Esteem is a prosthetic inner-ear stimulator. ""When I wore a hearing aid, I turned it off when I got home because all the background noise was so agitating,"" said Merlo, 40. ""But I keep (the Esteem) on."" A controller the size of a cellphone enables her to set her Esteem to different environments, such as ""home,"" ""restaurant"" or ""school.""



Merlo's doctor, ear surgeon Sam Marzo of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, has performed 40 Esteem implants since he was trained by its manufacturer, Envoy Medical Corp. in St. Paul, Minn., in 2010. He is the only Chicago-area surgeon authorized to implant the device, said an Envoy representative. Esteem was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March 2010. (For surgeons outside Chicago, visit envoymedical.com.)



""This really fills a need for adults with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss,"" Marzo said. The condition is caused by damage to the inner ear or to nerves from the inner ear to the brain. For patients with profound hearing loss, a cochlear implant is a better option, he said.



""Esteem is great for people who have used hearing aids but are not happy with them,"" Marzo said. ""Aids require a lot of upkeep and need frequent battery changes. And they amplify all the noise so it's hard to filter out background noise.""



Implanting the Esteem is a three-hour outpatient procedure done under general anesthesia. About two months post-surgery, when internal swelling has subsided, the doctor turns on the device.



""It is surgery, so there is pain at first,"" Merlo said. ""But within a few days I was comfortable. I had an incision behind my ear, but my hair covers it. Cosmetically, you can't see anything now.""



The implant is permanent. It contains a battery that must be replaced in about seven years.



Merlo had Esteem implanted in her left ear in September. In March, she plans to have one put in her right ear.



Even with one implant, Merlo called the results ""surreal."" ""There are little things that I probably heard when I was younger, before my hearing loss, but I don't remember them,"" she said. ""Since I got the implant, they're new to me. Branches tapping the windows, the breathing of the horses when I ride, different instruments in my favorite songs. I always loved music but now I can really hear it.""



The implant also allows Merlo to hear herself talking. ""That helps my speech,"" she said. ""Now I know if I blur my THs.""



Merlo said her children no longer have to be her extra ears, telling her when the oven timer beeps or when the doorbell rings. ""Now they tell me, 'You never say 'What?' anymore,"" she said.



""My husband and I joke that the best wife is the one who doesn't hear,"" Merlo said. ""But not hearing affects everything. People used to think I was standoffish in social situations because I was quiet. I nodded a lot because I couldn't hear them. Now I can.""",0

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 11, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new type of stem cell treatment for people with type 1 diabetes appears to help re-educate rogue immune system cells, which allows cells in the pancreas to start producing insulin again.

The treatment, which combines a patient's immune system cells with stem cells from a donor's cord blood, even worked in people with long-standing diabetes who were believed to have no insulin-producing ability.

Although the treatment didn't wean anyone off insulin completely, average blood sugar levels dropped significantly, which would reduce the risk of long-term complications.

""Our study brings a new hope for people with type 1 diabetes. If we can control the autoimmunity, we may reverse the diabetes. We showed that the islets [cells] can start to work again,"" said Dr. Yong Zhao, an assistant professor in the section of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism at the University of Illinois at Chicago.

This treatment could potentially be useful in other autoimmune diseases, such as lupus and rheumatoid arthritis.

""It's quite remarkable that this approach, based on the re-education of immune cells, might work so well. The concept is very intriguing, and the treatment seems to be so simple and so safe,"" said Dr. Luca Inverardi, deputy director of translational research at the Diabetes Research Institute, University of Miami School of Medicine.

But he's also ""reasonably cautious,"" he said. ""The follow-up is long, up to 40 weeks, but it's not long enough to declare victory against diabetes yet,"" said Inverardi.

Also, he noted that the study involved only 15 Chinese people, and that type 1 diabetes is a bit different in that population. He said he'd like to see larger studies with a more diverse population, followed for a longer time.

Results of the study were published online Jan. 9 in the journal BMC Medicine.

Type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease, occurs when the body's immune system cells mistakenly attack the insulin-producing (beta) cells in the pancreas. Because their beta cells don't produce enough or any insulin, people with type 1 diabetes have to replace the lost insulin through injections to survive.

Stopping that autoimmune attack appears to be crucial to any treatment that hopes to cure or reverse type 1 diabetes.

Zhao's team developed a completely new approach. They take blood from a patient and separate out the immune system cells (lymphocytes). They briefly expose those cells to stem cells from umbilical cord blood from an unrelated infant and return the lymphocytes alone to the patient's body. The researchers have dubbed this ""Stem Cell Educator Therapy,"" because while exposed to the stem cells, the lymphocytes seem to relearn how they should behave.

The study participants, who were 15 to 41 years old, had had type 1 diabetes for an average of nine years. Six had some residual beta cell function and six did not. Both groups were given stem cell educator therapy. The other three people served as the control group.

The researchers measured C-peptide, a protein fragment that's a byproduct of insulin production, and found that the educator therapy group had improved levels of C-peptide at 12 weeks. These levels continued to improve until 24 weeks, and remained stable through the follow-up at 40 weeks. There were no changes in C-peptide in the control group.

The average daily dose of insulin dropped almost 39 percent after 12 weeks for the group with some beta cell function and 25 percent in those with no beta cell function, suggesting that the group with no beta cell function now produced insulin.

""That means if you stop the autoimmune reaction, you may see beta cell regeneration, or there might be other precursor cells in the pancreas. If these data are confirmed, this is a very provocative and remarkable finding,"" Inverardi said.

The average hemoglobin A1C level dropped 1.06 percent for those with residual beta cell function and 1.68 percent for those without beta cell function. A1C levels measure average blood sugar levels over two to three months, and people with type 1 diabetes are advised to maintain A1C levels below 7 percent. A drop of 1 percent in A1C levels can reduce the risk of complications.

This was an initial clinical trial designed to test for safety. Zhao said that in future trials he hopes that with additional treatments people might get off insulin altogether.

But, even if that's not possible, the recovery of some beta cell function would be welcome news. ""In the absence of complete remission, there are very sizable advantages to having some beta cell function,"" Inverardi noted.

Both experts said the treatment appears safe, with no risk of rejection. No significant side effects were reported during the trial, other than some arm soreness where blood was taken and returned.

"Smokers who count on nicotine patches or gum to help them quit may want to reconsider: A new study finds that these and other nicotine replacement products aren’t effective at preventing former smokers from relapsing in real-world conditions.

Among 787 adults who had quit smoking within the previous two years, nearly a third reported having returned to using cigarettes, according to a study published online Monday by the journal Tobacco Control. Those who had used nicotine patches, gum, inhalers or nasal sprays were just as likely to relapse as those who had quit without them, researchers from Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts found.

The findings run counter to the results of several randomized clinical trials conducted before the Food and Drug Administration gave the thumbs-up to these nicotine replacement products in the 1990s. In those trials, volunteers using such products were up to three times more likely to kick the smoking habit.

But the latest results are in line with other studies that have found little — if any — benefit from the products when used by smokers in real life. In some cases, studies have found that people who use products like nicotine patches and gums are more likely to relapse than their counterparts who go cold turkey.

“This may indicate that some heavily dependent smokers perceive NRT [nicotine replacement therapy] as a sort of ‘magic’ pill, and, upon realizing it is not, they find themselves without support in their quitting efforts, doomed to failure,” the researchers wrote.

The new study examined former smokers three times over a five-year period. At the midpoint of the study, 30.6% of recent quitters had gone back to smoking. By the end, 31.3% had relapsed.

American smokers spend more than $1.5 billion on nicotine gum, patches and related products each year, according to the study. Much of that comes from public health programs, which are facing further rounds of budget cuts. Policymakers ought to rethink their willingness to pay for nicotine replacement therapy, the researchers wrote, and consider shifting that money to initiatives aimed at discouraging smoking in general, such as anti-smoking campaigns and efforts to raise tobacco taxes.

But GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, which makes Nicorette, Nicoderm, Commit lozenges and other smoking cessation products, said that would be premature. The company noted that most of the adults in the study who used nicotine replacement products didn’t use them for the recommended eight weeks. Had those people followed directions, they might have had more success.

“Hundreds of clinical trials involving more than 35,000 participants and extensive consumer use for more than 20 years have proven both the efficacy and safety of NRT when used as directed,” the company said in a statement. “NRT products have helped millions of smokers quit by gradually weaning them off of their tobacco addiction and is recommended as a first-line therapy for quitting.”

"In a study suggesting that red wine might be the next big thing in breast cancer prevention, a study has found that women who drank just under two servings of red wine daily experienced hormonal changes that mimic the effects of a drug used to prevent malignant breast tumors from coming back.

The study, published Friday in the Journal of Women’s Health, found that consuming the same amount of white wine did not have the same effect in premenopausal women participating in the study.

Women intent on warding off breast cancer have been warned about alcohol consumption: as recently as November, a study found that women who consumed as few as three servings of alcohol a week increased their risk of developing the disease, which strikes one in eight American women at some point in life.

White wine and other alcoholic beverages are believed to promote the conversion of androgens--""male hormones” such as testosterone, which circulate in all women’s blood--into estrogen. And the greater a woman’s lifetime exposure to estrogen--whether her own or estrogen that comes from medication or environmental sources--the higher her risk of developing breast cancer.

But red wine acts differently, the present study found. Instead of promoting the conversion of androgens to estrogen in a woman’s body, red wine appears to block that process. In that sense, it acts more like a class of drug called aromatase inhibitors, which are prescribed to most women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer to prevent recurrences.

It’s not the alcohol in red wine that appears to conjure such magic. It’s the phytochemicals, which also are found in grapes, grape juice and grape seed extract. Resveratrol, one of the phytochemicals found plentifully in red wine, has been linked to a host of disease-preventing processes.

Researchers led by a team from Cedars-Sinai’s Heart Institute and Medical Center found that study participants who drank eight ounces of red wine daily (the equivalent of almost two servings at five ounces per serving) showed a significantly different mix of seven sex hormones than those who drank the same amount of white wine. Among the red wine drinkers, estrogen levels were lower and androgen levels were higher.

The current study was small--36 women, with an average age of 36, participated. Each drank eight ounces nightly of Cabernet Sauvignon wine for most of a single menstrual cycle, then drank no alcohol for a little over a week and then drank eight ounces of Chardonnay nightly for roughly the next 21 days.

The authors asserted this was the first rigorous study to find that red wine is a “nutritional aromatase inhibitor in healthy premenopausal women.” Another study has found that women who drank more red wine showed less breast density on mammograms--an emerging marker for breast cancer risk-- than those who drank other forms of alcohol.

THURSDAY, Jan. 5, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary findings suggest a drug used to treat another disease might also reduce painful flare-ups in gout patients starting new medication regimens.

In a new study, the protein-inhibitor drug rilonacept (Arcalyst) appeared to markedly lower the risk of gout flare-ups during the first few months of treatments aimed at lowering uric acid levels.

While effective in lowering the risk for gout attacks in the long-term, uric acid-lowering treatment can initially boost the risk for flare-ups as it breaks up and releases the uric acid crystal deposits at the source.

""To reduce deposits of crystals in the joints, we advise patients to initiate treatment with medications that lower levels of uric acid in the blood,"" study author Dr. H. Ralph Schumacher, Jr., a professor of medicine at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, said in a journal news release.

Gout, a debilitating and painful form of inflammatory arthritis, now affects upwards of 8.3 million Americans, according to the release. Flare-ups , which involve excruciating joint pain, redness, swelling and warmth, can last days or weeks.

The researchers wanted to learn if rilonacept could lower this short-term risk for by neutralizing a specific target protein -- interleukin 1 or IL-1 -- before it initiates inflammation.

They looked at 83 gout patients in 27 U.S. study centers who had a history of gout flare-ups and high levels of uric acid. All were placed on a chronic uric-acid lowering regimen of the standard drug allopurinol.

About half were also given an initial double-dose injection of rilonacept (320 milligrams) followed by a single dose for 16 weeks. The other half received sugar pills.

Rilonacept patients were less likely to have flare-ups, with 15 percent experiencing flare-ups three-months into the study compared with 45 percent among the non-rilonacept group, the researchers found.

""Well-tolerated drugs that reduce the risk of gout flares when initiating uric-acid lowering therapy could make patients more likely to continue important long-term treatments that control gout,"" Schumacher said in the release.

""(And) this trial provides well-controlled evidence that this IL-1 blocker is effective in preventing acute gout flares in this setting,"" he added. ""Rilonacept appears safe and well tolerated and could increase patient adherence to long-term urate-lowering therapy.""

The study appeared online Jan. 5 in the journal Arthritis & Rheumatism.

Dr. Michael A. Becker, a professor emeritus of medicine at the University of Chicago, described the findings as ""very promising."" However, he cautioned that the high cost of rilonacept will most likely curtail its use.

""This is a very expensive drug,"" he said. ""And insurance will be an issue. So I think you will have to carefully justify its use and define the universe of patients who are likely to be treated with it.""

""But there are a number of patients who can't take a less expensive alternative, such as nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, because of their kidney function or ulcer disease,"" Becker noted. ""So for this population of patients who can't tolerate cheaper medications, rilonacept may be a necessary indication.""

"Could a vitamin make antidepressants work better?

That's the tantalizing premise behind Deplin, a prescription form of the B-vitamin folate. Although it has been on the market since 2006, Deplin is generating growing buzz at psychiatric conferences and among clinicians and patients, particularly those who haven't responded to antidepressants or did for a while only to have their depression return.

""Many of the patients I put on Deplin come back and say, 'Wow, my medication is working again' or 'Hey, doc, this medicine never worked this well before,' "" says psychiatrist Thor Bergersen, who practices in Needham, Mass., and New York City.

It's long been known that folate—found naturally in green, leafy vegetables, legumes, nuts and some fruits—is important for cell growth and brain function. How and why is now becoming clearer. Recent research has found that the body converts folate (and folic acid, the synthetic version) into an active form called L-methylfolate, which is needed to produce serotonin, dopamine and norepinephrine, three neurotransmitters that are critical in regulating mood.

Trial and Error For many patients, treating depression involves trying multiple drugs over a long period of time. • Nearly 20 million people in the U.S. suffer depression during their lifetime. •11% of Americans over age 12 take antidepressants. • Only 30% get well on the first antidepressant alone. • Up to 50% of patients never reach remission. • People with low folate levels are six times as likely to fail to respond to antidepressants as those with normal levels. Sources: CDC; NIMH; Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology

Aging, illness, genetics, poor nutrition, excess alcohol consumption and some medications can all reduce L-methylfolate levels, leaving those neurotransmitters in short supply, some researchers say. While many popular antidepressants slow the ""reuptake"" of serotonin or norepinephrine, making them available longer to the brain, such drugs may not work for long or at all if the brain isn't producing sufficient quantities of the neurotransmitters in the first place, some experts theorize.

""This is a totally new way to look at depression. We may be getting at the very foundation of why many people never achieve a full remission,"" says John Zajecka, director of the Depression Treatment & Research Center at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Dr. Zajecka has helped investigate Deplin and is on the speakers bureau for its maker, Pamlab LLC, of Covington, La.

Pamlab officials say that Deplin, which contains L-methylfolate, can directly supply what some people need to make sufficient quantities of neurotransmitters that regulate mood. And it does so more efficiently than taking extra folic acid, which still needs to be converted, they say.

As convincing as that sounds, clinical evidence is limited. Pamlab, which currently has the market to itself, sells Deplin as a ""medical food,"" a category that isn't held to the same standards the Food and Drug Administration demands of new drugs. Medical foods are intended to provide dietary management for a disease or condition; all ingredients must be ""generally recognized as safe"" and physician supervision is required.

Nearly 30,000 clinicians have prescribed Deplin in the past three years, according to Pamlab, and monthly prescriptions grew 31% to nearly 39,000 in October from January 2011. Still, that's a tiny fraction of the more than 20 million prescriptions for antidepressants every month in the U.S.

Just two randomized, placebo-controlled trials have evaluated Deplin, with a total of 223 subjects. Both were supported by Pamlab. In one study, presented at the American Psychiatric Association's meeting in May, 75 depressed patients were randomly assigned to take either 15 milligrams of Deplin or a placebo along with an antidepressant. After 30 days, 32% of subjects on Deplin had responded, compared with 15% on the placebo. However, an earlier study using a lower dose of Deplin found no difference with a placebo. Subjects reported no more side effects with Deplin than with the placebo in either trial.

About Folate • Folate, a B vitamin found naturally in some foods, is needed to maintain cell growth and brain function. Deficiencies are associated with depression, certain types of anemia and birth defects. Poor diet, aging, illness, alcoholism and some medications can lower folate levels. • Folic acid is the synthetic form of folate, found in supplements and used to fortify grains. • L-methylfolate, the active form of folate, helps produce the neurotransmitters critical to regulating mood. About 50% of Americans have genetic variations that reduce their ability to create L-methylfolate, which may raise their risk of depression. Sources: CNS Spectrum; WSJ reporting

The biggest gripe with Deplin is the cost: One month's supply of Deplin, either at 7.5 milligrams or 15 milligrams, can cost as much as $98 and not all insurers cover it. Pamlab has a licensed generic version called simply L-Methylfolate that went on the market in August and is priced somewhat lower. More insurers are covering that version, some with copayments as low as $20, says Pamlab, which also makes medical foods for managing other conditions, including asthma.

Pamlab officials say they hope eventually to win FDA approval for Deplin as a prescription drug. The company says it plans to start Phase II trials later this year; one branch of the trials will assess whether Deplin could effectively treat depression on its own.

Researchers also hope to determine which patients would benefit most from Deplin, to cut down on the frustrating trial-and-error process many people face in finding an effective antidepressant. One target could be people who have a genetic variation that reduces their ability to make L-methylfolate. Roughly 30% of the U.S. population has one abnormal copy of the gene known as MTHFR 677, and 12% has two abnormal copies, giving them less than one-third of the typical amount of L-methylfolate, researchers say.

But some people who had two normal copies of the MTHFR gene also responded well to Deplin, ""so there are clearly other factors involved as well,"" says Harold Koch, Pamlab's chief scientific officer.

Despite the uncertainties, some clinicians say they are comfortable prescribing Deplin. ""I have had people write me thank-you notes because it's given them a boost of energy and happiness,"" says Judy Paley, an internist in Denver, Colo.

""My patients who have responded are not people who are suggestible. They've been trying different medications for years,"" says Andres San Martin, a Manhattan psychiatrist who specializes in treating resistant depression.

Other experts are more cautious. ""It doesn't appear to have a lot of downsides, but sometimes it takes a few years of use to recognize them,"" says Ken Duckworth, medical director of the National Alliance on Mental Illness, an education and advocacy group. Dr. Duckworth also urges patients with resistant depression to try cognitive-behavioral therapy, aerobic exercise and substance-abuse programs, all of which have clear evidence of effectiveness. ""And remember there is no silver bullet,"" he says.

THURSDAY, Dec. 29, 2011 (HealthDay News) --Concentrating on music can provide enough distraction to ease the pain of people with significant anxiety, according to a new study.

Researchers from the University of Utah Pain Research Center studied the effectiveness of music as a pain reliever on 143 study participants. The volunteers were asked to follow a melody so they could identify the tones that stood out. While tackling the assignment, they received safe pain shocks with fingertip electrodes.

The study, published in the December issue of the Journal of Pain, found that pain was reduced as the demands of the music task rose. The researchers explained that the music competed with the participants' pain pathways. By triggering emotional responses and engaging the participants' minds, the music task helped to ease their pain.

Participants with the most anxiety about the pain became more engrossed in the music-listening task than those who were less anxious, according to a journal news release. The study authors suggested that experiencing little anxiety lowered the participants' ability to focus on the task.

The researchers concluded that people with a lot of anxiety who can become preoccupied by activities, such as listening to music, can reduce discomfort by using this type of pain-relief strategy.

Doctors should take patients' personality traits into consideration before suggesting pain therapies such as music, the authors said.

TUESDAY, Dec. 27, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A new test measuring levels of troponin I in the blood may help determine whether someone is really having a heart attack earlier than is currently possible.

Troponin I is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle has been damaged such as during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Researchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed.

The new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours.

The study was partially funded by Brahms AG and Abbott Diagnostics. Abbott Diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study.

""We can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test,"" said Dr. Sandra Chaparro, a cardiologist at the University of Miami Hospital in Florida. ""If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack.""

Many people come to the emergency room with chest pain. Typically, the doctor orders an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart, along with blood work. Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained. This is where the blood test would be used.

""It is very common to have people going to the hospital with chest pain and it could be something important or something not significant,"" she said. A more sensitive test could save a lot of money, she noted.

Dr. Michael Lanigan, an emergency room doctor at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NYC, said the ultimate goal is a highly specific and sensitive test that can tell doctors right away if you are having a heart attack. The new test ""helps push the envelope further,"" he said. ""We need a blood test that can tell people when they walk in or soon thereafter that they are having a heart attack because the sooner you make the diagnosis, the sooner you can start the right therapy.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - A hormone called DHEA and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to help women who are going through menopause and could also give them better sex lives, a study found on Tuesday.

Italian researchers writing in the journal of the International Menopause Society, Climacteric, said they had found the first robust evidence that low doses of DHEA can help sexual function and menopausal symptoms, suggesting it may one day become an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT).

But they stressed that the trial was small, so far larger studies are needed to confirm the results.

“We must bear in mind that this is a pilot study with a small sample,” Anna Fenton, co-editor of Climacteric, said in commentary on the work. “We can’t yet say that this study means that DHEA is a viable alternative to HRT, but ... we should be looking to do larger studies to confirm these initial results.”

DHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone, is a natural steroid hormone mostly made in the adrenal glands and has a variety of therapeutic uses.

HRT, which is a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, is an approved treatment for women going through the menopause, who often experience unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, loss of sex drive and mood swings.

But sales of HRT drugs have fallen sharply since a large study in 2002 found higher rates of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and strokes in women who took the pills, and the search has since been on for alternatives.

American researchers said in January that the antidepressant Lexapro, made by drugmaker Forest Laboratories, significantly cut the number and severity of hot flushes in menopausal women, and other antidepressants including GlaxoSmithKline’s Paxil and the Pfizer drugs Prozac and Effexor also have been found to be effective.

For this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms.

Over a year, 12 women took vitamin D and calcium, 12 took DHEA, 12 took standard HRT and 12 took a synthetic steroid called tibolone which is used to alleviate menopausal symptoms.

The women’s menopausal symptoms, sexual interest and activity were measured using a standard questionnaire that explores factors such as satisfaction with frequency of sex, vaginal lubrication, orgasm, and sexual partner.

After 12 months, all the women on hormone replacements had improvements in menopausal symptoms, but those taking vitamin D and calcium did not show any significant improvement.

At the start of the trial, all groups had similar sexual activity, but after the year, those taking calcium and vitamin D scored an average of 34.9 on the questionnaire scale, while those taking DHEA had a score of 48.6, showing that those on DHEA had more sexual interest and activity.

The results for the HRT group were similar, and both the HRT DHEA groups showed a higher level of sexual intercourse in comparison to the control group, the researchers said.

Genazzani said the results showed DHEA has potential, especially for those women who may have problems in taking more conventional HRT. “But this is a small study, a proof of concept. What we need to do now is to look at a larger study, to confirm that these initial results are valid,” she added.",1

TUESDAY, Dec. 6 (HealthDay News)-- Women who get routine mammograms can lower their risk of dying from breast cancer by nearly half, a new Dutch study suggests.

""Our study adds further to the evidence that mammography screening unambiguously reduces breast cancer mortality,"" said Dr. Suzie Otto, a senior researcher in the department of public health at Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands.

The routine screening also lowered the chances of being diagnosed with an advanced cancer, she said.

The study appears online Dec. 6 in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers & Prevention.

Mammography screening, including the best schedule and the best age to begin, is being hotly debated in the United States and elsewhere. Some experts think women should start getting them at age 40. Other think women should discuss the pros and cons of the test at 40, decide on an individual basis and start screens routinely at 50. Otto's study only looked at women aged 49 and older.

Otto tracked 755 patients who died from breast cancer from 1995 to 2003 and another 3,739 control patients matched by age and other measures.

Among the women with breast cancer, nearly 30 percent of tumors were found at screening and about 34 percent between screens. Nearly 36 percent of these women had never had a mammogram.

Advanced tumors were found in about 30 percent of the patients who had never been screened but in just over 5 percent of those who had mammograms.

Women who underwent screening reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 49 percent. Women aged 70 to 75 had the greatest risk reduction, reducing the risk of dying from breast cancer by 84 percent. The risk reduction in younger women, aged 50 to 69, was smaller, at 39 percent, but still considered substantial.

The greater risk reduction in women aged 70 to 75, Otto said, is probably a result of the long-term good effects of screening participation in the earlier target age group, 50 to 69, before the upper age limit for screening was extended in the Netherlands from 69 to 75.

The study findings ''add to the body of evidence supporting the fact that mammography matters in improving detection and survival,"" said Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""This study focuses on survival.""

The study, however, has some limitations, Bernik noted. It's not clear, for instance, whether the women who died of cancer got less aggressive treatment or refused treatment. That could have affected survival, of course.

Mammography does lead to ''overtreatment"" in some cases, Bernik acknowledged. Some cancers that are found on mammography may not have proven to be an issue in a woman's lifetime. ""But there is no way to figure out which cancers will be a problem or not,"" she said.

"Dec. 2, 2011 (Chicago) -- An experimental approach in which penile nerve tissue is frozen to knock out overactive nerves helped men with premature ejaculation last three times longer.

Researchers tested the technique on 24 men who hadn't been helped by standard treatments. They lasted an average of 110 seconds before ejaculation, or nearly two minutes, over the three months they were followed, compared with 36 seconds before treatment.

"Dec. 1, 2011 (Chicago) -- An experimental treatment that involves spinal injections of ozone gas and steroids relieved pain in over two-thirds of 327 people with back problems related to a herniated disc.

This condition occurs when the cushions, or discs, that serve as shock absorbers for the spine become inflamed and bulge or break open. When inflamed, discs press against nearby nerves. People with this condition can experience pain, numbness, and weakness in the back, buttocks, and legs.

None of the people in this study had been helped by other nonsurgical therapies, and supporters say the new therapy could become a standard treatment for such patients. But a back pain specialist who spoke to WebMD says that further research is needed.

In the study, 119 people (37%) reported no pain at six months. About another third reported less frequent episodes of low back pain, ""maybe once a day,"" says researcher Thomas Lehnert, MD, an assistant professor of radiology at Frankfurt University in Germany.

Another 22% reported only a little improvement, with pain persisting. And 7% had no improvement or their pain got worse. A few patients resorted to back surgery.

Still, ozone therapy could even help many patients with unrelenting back pain to avoid surgery, Lehnert tells WebMD. Before the treatment, patients had tried everything without success and were considering an operation, he says.

Studies suggest that ozone therapy works by reducing inflammation, shrinking herniated discs, and relieving pressure on the nerves bringing pain signals to the brain. The steroid further reduces inflammation.

Lehnert presented the findings here at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America.",1

WEDNESDAY, Nov. 30, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Eating baked or broiled fish as little as once a week may boost brain health and lower the risk for mild cognitive impairment and Alzheimer's disease, new brain scan research suggests.

The study authors found that eating baked and broiled fish -- but not fried -- helps to preserve gray matter neurons, strengthening them in areas of the brain deemed critical to memory and cognition.

""Those who eat baked or broiled fish had larger brains,"" noted study author Dr. Cyrus Raji, a resident in the department of medicine at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center, Mercy Hospital. ""They had larger brain cells in areas of the brain responsible for memory and learning. And the reason that's important is that these brain areas are at high risk for Alzheimer's disease.""

In those people with larger brain volume, ""the risk for Alzheimer's and mild cognitive impairment went down by fivefold within five years following the brain scans we conducted,"" he said.

Raji said he was ""amazed"" that this effect was seen with eating fish as little as one to four times a week. ""We're talking about just a half serving a day,"" he said. ""And that would be a very small lifestyle change that can affect disease risk a long time down the line.""

Raji and his colleagues are slated to discuss their findings Wednesday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America, in Chicago.

More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, an incurable, age-related disorder that slowly destroys memory and thinking and language skills. Older adults with mild cognitive impairment have less severe memory loss than those with Alzheimer's but often go on to develop the disease.

To assess the impact of fish on cognitive health, the authors focused on 260 mentally healthy elderly individuals drawn from the Cardiovascular Health Study, sponsored by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute.

All the participants underwent 3-D MRIs, so the researchers could map out the size of each individual's gray matter and track it over 10 years. They also completed the U.S. National Cancer Institute Food Frequency Questionnaire.

The team then stacked up gray matter changes against dietary consumption as reported in the questionnaire.

The questionnaires revealed that 163 of the study participants ate fish at least once a week, with most consuming fish between one and four times a week.

With that information, the authors found that regardless of age, gender, physical activity routines, and/or educational achievement, race or weight, those who ate baked or broiled fish had larger mass in the hippocampus, precuneus, posterior cingulate and orbital frontal cortex regions of their brains.

The team further observed that people who ate baked or broiled fish weekly displayed better so-called ""working memory,"" enabling them to more effectively execute routine tasks.

But fish and chips lovers, take note: No cranial benefit was evident with respect to consumption of fried fish.

The team cautioned that while eating baked and broiled fish appears to exert some cognitive benefit, other lifestyle and socioeconomic factors may play a role. For now, the connection must be viewed as an association, rather than a cause-and-effect.

Dr. Richard Lipton, vice chair of neurology at the Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, reiterated the point.

""One has to wonder if there are other factors associated with fish consumption that they didn't measure that might be protective,"" he said. ""Like maybe people who eat fish exercise more, or eat less total calories. Or they could be eating other components of a Mediterranean Diet, such as fruits and vegetables.""

Lipton added that ""this group of researchers is really, really good,"" and called the study results ""a very interesting finding, and absolutely worthy of further exploration.""

Research presented at scientific meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

"Patients generally sit in front of the light box, which can be as small as 9 by 11 inches and 5 inches deep, with the bright light emanating from the square surface, in the morning. “With the natural dawn being later in winter, the body rhythms drift late,” Dr. Lewy said. “If you can fix the drift, you can fix the depression.”

Light therapy may even help with major nonseasonal depression, experts say, and with sleep disorders. And because it has few side effects, researchers are studying whether light therapy can help with depression during pregnancy and be used to treat elderly people with dementia. It is also being investigated for the treatment of bulimia nervosa, severe premenstrual syndrome and even attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and bipolar disorder.

Though randomized controlled clinical trials of bright light are difficult to do properly — one expert is fond of saying that it is difficult to “blind” studies of bright light — the American Psychiatric Association considers bright-light therapy an effective low-risk treatment for both S.A.D. and nonseasonal major depressive disorder.

A 2006 multicenter double-blind randomized controlled trial that compared bright-light therapy head to head with the popular antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine) in 96 subjects found the two treatments equally effective for alleviating winter depression, though light produced results faster, usually within a week, and with fewer side effects.

Why, then, do so few doctors prescribe bright-light therapy? Some say their patients don’t have the patience to sit in front of a light for 30 to 45 minutes every morning. Moreover, “doctors are just more comfortable prescribing medication, because that’s what they do for everything,” Dr. Lewy said.

Some patients who suffer from chronic depression say they use light therapy in addition to their regular medication in the winter months.

“I’ve always seen a drastic change in my personality from spring and summer to fall and winter, and it got worse as I got older,” said Rick Bach, 54, a painter who owns a hair salon in West Hartford, Conn., and tries to spend every January in Puerto Rico.

But while bright-light treatment is helpful, he said, it is not sufficient for him. “It can help you from falling into a deep depression, but it won’t help you climb out of one,” he said.

No one knows exactly how light treatment works, but most experts seem to agree that the body has a master biological clock that responds to or is “set” by natural light fluctuations.

“Light does more than just enable us to see,” said Dr. Norman Rosenthal, author of the landmark book “Winter Blues,” who was among the first to identify and describe S.A.D. Light also has an effect on hormones, the body’s chemical messengers, affecting the brain’s hypothalamus, which is involved in regulating mood, energy and appetite.

“The hormone melatonin, which is secreted at night, can be suppressed by light,” Dr. Rosenthal said. “Studies have also shown that light influences serotonin and epinephrine pathways in the brain, the same neurotransmitter systems known to be affected in people with general depression.”

But while part of the appeal of light therapy is that it can be self-prescribed, using a light box is not as simple as it may appear. Experts recommend consulting with a knowledgeable health care provider before starting treatment to rule out other medical conditions and to help with monitoring and adjusting bright-light exposure.

Some patients may want to try simply getting more natural light to help with seasonal mood changes — getting out as much as possible during the brightest time of day in the winter, sitting near windows during the day or taking vacations to sunny locales in the winter.

If you choose to try light therapy, here are a few tips from experts.

COSTS Light boxes can be purchased for about $200 online; they are also available for rent. Some patients manage to get insurance reimbursement by having a doctor write a letter, but don’t count on your policy covering it.

PRECAUTIONS Side effects include headaches and hypomania, though experts say these are rare. Face the light but do not stare at the light. If you have an eye condition of any kind, clear light therapy with your ophthalmologist first.

TUESDAY, Nov. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An apple a day won't necessarily keep the doctor away, but three kiwis just might help, at least according to a small study that showed that the brown, fuzzy fruit may lower blood pressure levels.

Men and women with mildly high blood pressure who ate three kiwi fruits a day for eight weeks had systolic blood pressure levels that were 3.6 millimeters of mercury lower than those of volunteers who ate an apple a day. Systolic blood pressure is the upper number in a blood pressure measurement.

Kiwis may be small, but they pack a lot of nutrition in their green flesh. They are rich in lutein, a potent antioxidant, and this may be what is responsible for their blood pressure-lowering powers, said researchers who were led by Mette Svendsen of Oslo University Hospital in Norway. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the American Heart Association's annual meeting in Orlando, Fla.

Cardiologists were quick to caution that there is no single magic food or ingredient that is the key to heart health, but they all agreed that kiwi may have a place in the five daily servings of fruit and vegetables that are currently recommended as part of a heart-healthy diet.

The new study included 50 men and 68 women with an average age of 55 who were randomly assigned to eat three kiwis or one apple a day for eight weeks. Participants had blood pressure levels in the mildly elevated range of 128/85 when the study began. A blood pressure reading that is less than 120/80 is considered ideal. They changed nothing in their diet other than adding the fruit. Researchers measured blood pressure via 24-hour ambulatory monitoring, which is thought to be more precise than measuring it during a single point in time.

The Oslo University Hospital funded the study.

""Three kiwi a day improved 24-hour blood pressure more than an apple a day,"" the researchers concluded.

So, is kiwi the new ""wonder"" fruit?

""There is biological plausibility, but I would not go and grab three kiwis a day,"" said Dr. Nehal Mehta, a preventive cardiologist at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. ""They are not easy to find or one of those fruits that people readily grab.""

Moderation is the key with kiwis or any food, he said. ""Three kiwis a day or 21 kiwis a week does not seem like moderation, and I would caution against eating that much,"" he said.

The new study may just ""put kiwis on the map,"" he said. ""When we say 'eat more fresh fruit,' we stick to the tried-and-true or anything that is handheld and peeled, but these findings suggest that a kiwi can be part of a heart-healthy diet,"" he said.

In addition, the study looked at the whole fruit, not individual nutrients. Don't start popping lutein in supplement form based on these results, he noted.

Dr. Suzanne Steinbaum, a preventive cardiologist with Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. ""Kiwi is not the wonder fruit, but certainly adding kiwi to your diet can help decrease mildly high blood pressure levels.""

Dr. Elliott M. Antman, a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School in Boston, said that while promising, the new study is small. ""Don't count on this to be the complete answer to high blood pressure,"" he said. Whatever you do, ""do not stop taking your blood pressure medications without talking to your doctor,"" he added.

Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Nov. 14, 2011 -- The first use of heart stem cells in humans looks like a major breakthrough for people suffering heart failure after heart attacks.

It's early -- results are in for only the first 16 patients -- but the results already are drawing praise from experts not easily impressed by first reports.

""This is a groundbreaking study of extreme importance,"" Joshua Hare, MD, director of the University of Miami's Interdisciplinary Stem Cell Institute, tells WebMD via email. Hare was not involved in the study.

""The reported benefits are of an unexpected magnitude,"" writes Gerd Heusch, MD, PhD, chair of the Institute of Pathophysiology at the University of Essen, Germany, in an editorial in the Nov. 14 online issue of The Lancet.

Study researcher John H. Loughran, MD, of the University of Louisville, Ky., could barely contain his excitement in an interview with WebMD.

""The improvement we have seen in patients is quite encouraging,"" he says. ""Michael Jones, our first patient, could barely walk 30 feet [before treatment]. I saw him this morning. He says he plays basketball with his granddaughter, works on his farm, and gets on the treadmill for 30 minutes three times a week. It is stories like that that makes these results really encouraging.""

The breakthrough comes just as researchers were becoming discouraged by studies in which bone-marrow stem cells failed to heal damaged hearts.

Instead of getting stem cells from the bone marrow, the new technique harvests stem cells taken from the patients' own hearts during bypass surgery. Just 1 gram of heart tissue -- about 3.5 hundredths of an ounce -- is taken.

Using a technique invented by Brigham & Women's Hospital researchers Piero Anversa, MD, and colleagues, heart stem cells are taken from the tissue and grown in the lab. These adult stem cells already are committed to becoming heart cells, but they can transform into any of the three different kinds of heart tissues.

It's the first time tissue-specific stem cells, other than bone-marrow cells, have been tested in humans, Hare says.",1

MONDAY, Nov. 14, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Preliminary research suggests that a single injection of a man-made protein might lower levels of ""bad"" cholesterol.

Given in the abdomen, AMG145 reduced low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol levels among a group of healthy volunteers. The shot turned off a newly identified cholesterol regulator, PCSK9, which interferes with the liver's ability to clear bad cholesterol from the bloodstream.

The findings were presented Monday at the American Heart Association (AHA) annual meeting in Orlando, Fla. The study was funded by AMG145 manufacturer Amgen Inc.

High cholesterol is a major risk factor for heart disease. The first step toward lowering cholesterol is typically lifestyle changes, which include eating a low-fat diet and regular physical activity. For some, medications such as statins must be added to get cholesterol levels where they ought to be. Even this is not enough to get everyone's numbers into the safety zone, and not everyone can tolerate currently available medications. An LDL of less than 100 mg/dL of blood is considered optimal.

Study author Clapton Dias, medical sciences director of clinical pharmacology and early development at Amgen, in Thousand Oaks, Calif., said this shot could be given as an add-on to current cholesterol-lowering therapies for people who are not getting as low as they should be or as a standalone treatment for people who can't tolerate existing lipid-lowering drugs.

""Cardiovascular disease is the number one cause of death in the U.S., and while statins are very effective, a good proportion of people are not meeting their goals, and in this setting the shot could be a valuable addition,"" he said.

The study included 54 men and two women aged 18 to 45 who did not have elevated cholesterol levels. Participants received one of five doses of the new drug delivered via shot or intravenously or a placebo. Researchers measured LDL cholesterol levels for 85 to 113 days after treatment.

The new drug did hit its target, PCSK9, and decreased levels of LDL cholesterol by up to 64 percent. There were also decreases seen in levels of total cholesterol and apo-B (tiny fat particles in the blood that also increase the risk for heart disease). Levels of triglycerides and ""good"" HDL cholesterol were not altered by the medication, and there were no serious side effects reported. Now, researchers are testing the new shot in people who have high cholesterol.

Cardiologists were cautiously optimistic about the novel therapy.

Former AHA President Dr. Ralph Sacco said that it is too early to make any predictions about what role, if any, this therapy will have in lowering cholesterol levels, but it could one day fill an important void.

""Even though statins are so effective at lowering cholesterol and reducing risk for heart disease and stroke, they do need to be taken every day and they can have certain side effects in some people,"" said Sacco, who is also chairman of neurology at the University of Miami. Statin side effects can include liver damage and/or muscle pain.

""This new shot may provide a more long-lasting approach, especially if it could be given once a month,"" Sacco said.

Dr. Dan Rader, director of preventive cardiology at the University of Pennsylvania, said that PCSK9 is ""the hottest target for new treatments to lower LDL cholesterol."" And these study results will probably fuel that fire, he added.

""A 60-plus percent reduction in LDL with a single dose of this antibody is impressive,"" he said. ""It is the early days, but the data look strong. We now need more data with people who have repeated dosing and are followed for longer periods of time,"" Rader added.

""There are still plenty of people who can't achieve adequate LDL levels with existing drugs, including statins,"" he noted. Plus, ""people may find it easier to get a shot every two weeks or monthly than to take a pill every day.""

Research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

"A new scan to help in difficult-to-diagnose cases of Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes is available at more than 80 U.S. hospitals, including some in the Chicago area, since receiving federal approval earlier this year.



During the DaTscan test, an imaging drug is injected into a patient's bloodstream and the patient undergoes a single-photon emission computed tomography, or SPECT, scan. Patients with Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes have scans that show low levels of dopamine, the neurotransmitter critical in controlling movement and other muscle functions.



In cases where a diagnosis isn't necessarily clear-cut, the DaTscan offers important advances in patient care and treatment, said Dr. Michael Rezak, director of the Movement Disorders Center at Central DuPage Hospital, where the scan is offered.



""DaTscan is used in difficult-to-diagnose cases and must be used in conjunction with a clinical evaluation and a patient's response to medications,"" Rezak said. ""The earlier we get treatment started, the better. Before DaTscan we would watch and wait because there were no other objective tests to use. Now we can get a diagnosis sooner.""



The DaTscan injection was first used in Europe a decade ago, and GE Healthcare made it available to U.S. hospitals in late June. It is the first ""radiopharmaceutical adjunct imaging agent"" approved by the Food and Drug Administration that helps physicians better evaluate patients who are thought to have Parkinson's disease or other parkinsonian syndromes.



Approval of DaTscan followed two Phase 3 clinical trials in which 284 adult patients with tremors were studied. During an FDA advisory panel meeting, committee members were mostly positive about DaTscan, though one neurologist objected to the average $1,500 cost of a scan versus $150 for a month's supply of carbidopa or levodopa medications for a Parkinson's patient, according to Medscape Medical News.



""I was thrilled there was something that could positively tell me I had Parkinson's because everybody had guessed what I had,"" said Ray Ramas, 56, who in June became the first patient at Central DuPage to undergo the scan.



Before the test, Ramas, of West Chicago, experienced two years of uncertainty about his health as several specialists tried to pinpoint the cause of his joint and tendon pain, fatigue, stiffness in his legs and lack of bladder control. Eventually he developed a tremor in his right arm.



His doctor said he might have fibromyalgia and sent him to a rheumatologist. Another specialist said his symptoms suggested parkinsonian syndrome, caused by various neurodegenerative disorders that share some features of Parkinson's. ""Another doctor ... wanted me to see a psychiatrist because he thought my symptoms were all in my head,"" Ramas recalled.



By March, Ramas could hardly walk. He visited the emergency room at Central DuPage, where he was sent to Rezak, who told him about DaTscan.



""I lay on a table, got an injection and the procedure took about 20 minutes. It was like getting my blood drawn,"" he said. In two days, Ramas found out he had Parkinson's disease.



""Many patients are gratified to know what they're dealing with. It allows them to accept treatment earlier,"" Rezak said. Since June, 25 men and women of all ages have been tested with DaTscan at Central DuPage, Rezak said.



Northwestern Memorial Hospital has used DaTscan since October 2010 as part of a multicenter trial study, said Dr. William Spies, associate director of nuclear medicine at Northwestern.



As part of the study, recently diagnosed Parkinson's patients and healthy subjects are tested with DaTscan, and clinical and behavioral assessments are done to identify biomarkers of Parkinson's disease progression.



DaTscan was first used at the University of Chicago Medical Center in August on a 75-year-old male patient who exhibited essential tremors, parkinsonian syndrome and some rigidity and slowness, said Dr. Tao Xie, assistant professor of neurology at the Medical Center's Center for Parkinson's Disease and Movement Disorders.



""In the past, we would have had to wait to diagnose Parkinson's or chosen different medications to test, which might have had different side effects, and this would have delayed the timely diagnosis of Parkinson's,"" Xie said.",1
"MONDAY, Nov. 7, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An investigational drug called pridopidine seems an effective and safe treatment for people with the progressive movement disorder Huntington's disease, researchers report.

Huntington's patients have an imbalance in the signaling chemical dopamine. The new drug stabilizes dopamine signaling in areas of the brain that control movement and coordination.

According to the study authors, this is the first drug shown to improve patients' loss of ability to move their muscles voluntarily. The only drug currently approved for Huntington's is tetrabenazine, which treats only involuntary movements and can cause serious side effects.

The results of the phase 3 clinical trial, conducted by Spanish researchers led by Dr. Justo Garcia de Yebenes, of the department of neurology, Hospital Ramon y Cajal in Madrid, appear in the Nov. 7 online edition of The Lancet Neurology.

The study included 437 Huntington's disease patients from eight European countries. The participants took either pridopidine (45 milligrams once daily or 45 mg twice daily) or a placebo for 26 weeks.

After six months of treatment, patients taking the higher dose of pridopidine showed improvements in motor function -- specifically in eye and hand movements, involuntary muscle contractions (dystonia), and gait and balance -- compared with patients taking the placebo.

More than 70 percent of the patients taking the higher dose of the drug showed a significant benefit, according to the researchers. Side effects among patients taking the drug were similar to the placebo group.

""Pridopidine has the potential to complement available treatments by improving a different range of motor deficits. Its lack of severe side-effects . . . suggests that pridopidine might be useful even for those patients who are treated at sites that are not centers of excellence for Huntington's disease,"" the researchers concluded.

One U.S. neurologist agreed that the drug seems promising against a disease with few treatment options.

""There has been a great deal of attention for this drug, as it is one of the few molecules that in preliminary studies was found to have some efficacy in Huntington's disease,"" said Dr. Alessandro Di Rocco, professor in the department of neurology and chief of the division of movement disorders at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City.

""However, this is the first large study to show evidence of a positive result in treating the motor symptoms of this devastating disease. And, though the compound is apparently well tolerated without significant side effects, the benefit is modest and limited to the motor symptoms of the disease and it is unknown how long the improvement observed could last,"" he added.

Still, pridopidine does not get at the underlying cause of Huntington's disease, Di Rocco said.

""Unfortunately, Huntington's is a progressive disease and this drug is not a treatment of the disease itself but only improves some of its symptoms,"" he explained. ""Nevertheless, it is a welcome addition because there is very little else yet available to treat the symptoms. The challenge for scientists and clinicians is to discover therapies that actually slows or halts the progression of the disease.""

Another expert agreed that new treatment options for patients are sorely needed.

""A well-tolerated drug that produces even small benefits for patients with Huntington's disease would be a very welcome addition to the currently available treatments for this debilitating disorder,"" Andrew Feigin, from The Feinstein Institute for Medical Research in New York City, wrote in an accompanying commentary.

The study was funded by European pharmaceuticals company NeuroSearch A/S.

"A new pill may help in the fight with cystic fibrosis.

A study, funded in part by Vertex Pharmaceuticals, found the drug ivacaftor (pronounced eye va kaf tor) caused patients with a specific type of cystic fibrosis to improve lung function, gain weight, and fight other aspects of the disease.

“This is the first time that we have a therapy that is directed at the cause of cystic fibrosis,” says Dr. Michael Konstan, the chair of the Department of Pediatrics at Rainbow Babies and Children’s Hospital in Cleveland and one of the authors of the study. There is no cure for this disease and existing treatments just help alleviate some of the symptoms.

“This is a big deal,” says Robert Beall, the president and CEO of the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation. “The fact is it is obviously going to make a very big difference in the lives of patients.”

Cystic fibrosis is a genetic disease that causes problems with the balance of salt going in and out of cells. A sticky mucus clogs organs, particularly the lungs and liver. It can also cause digestive problems. About 1,000 new cases are diagnosed each year, according to the Cystic Fibrosis Foundation, and the average person with the disease dies before age 40.

Ivacaftor works for people with the G551D mutation of cystic fibrosis. Konstan says that only about 4% of the people with the disease have this specific mutation. “It really is a major milestone in the treatment of cystic fibrosis,” he says. “Even thought it only affects a small percentage (of patients) the hope is there that we can finally do something about this disease.”

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine Wednesday, looked at 84 people who got the drug. Those taking ivacaftor saw improvements within two weeks, which continued for the nearly yearlong trial. Drug recipients could blow out more than 10% more air from their lungs compared with patients who were not taking the drug, and were about half as likely to have a “pulmonary exacerbation” or a worsening of their lung disease that often requires hospitalization. On average, patients taking the drug grew more and put on more weight than the placebo group, according to the study, and had lower sweat chloride – an indicator of the disease.

Beall says the improved lung function helped patients double their ability to walk and one patient even started going the gym for the first time.

“We have an incredible proof of concept,” Beall says. He points to other research under way with ivacaftor combined with another drug that could help people with the most common mutation of cystic fibrosis. That trial is ongoing and the treatment is at least four or five years away from approval, but if it works, Beall says, it could help 90% of the people with cystic fibrosis.

In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Pamela Davis, of Case Western University paraphrased Winston Churchill, “This study is also a great victory in the war against genetic diseases and marks the end of the beginning for the treatment of the cystic fibrosis defect.”

Ivacaftor has been submitted to the FDA for approval, and could be available next year, according to Konstan. When it goes on sale it will be sold under the brand name Kalydeco (pronounced kuh-LYE-deh-koh).",1
"TUESDAY, Nov. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Multiple sclerosis patients may eventually benefit from a novel treatment that takes aim at the abnormal behavior of a specific type of immune cell, preliminary research suggests.

The errant behavior of the cells in question -- known as ""B cells"" -- is viewed as key to the development of this chronic and disabling nervous system disease, commonly called MS.

The new therapy's potential is only in the early stages of exploration, cautions an international study team comprised of researchers from the United States, Canada, Switzerland and the Netherlands, in the report published in the Nov. 1 online edition of The Lancet.

But initial indications suggest that the new antibody drug, called ocrelizumab, successfully targets these renegade cells with hopeful results: a significant reduction in disease-related inflammatory brain lesions.

""Our findings show that ocrelizumab rapidly suppresses inflammatory activity,"" noted the study authors, led by Dr. Ludwig Kappos from the University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, in a journal news release.

Describing the targeting of B cells as an ""innovative therapeutic approach,"" Kappos and his colleagues reported that in testing among 218 patients, the drug's impact on lesions was ""rapid and pronounced."" What's more, to date the treatment appears to be safe.

The study authors noted that MS is a progressively debilitating disease that attacks an individual's central nervous system, disrupting the normal brain, spinal cord and optic nerve function.

A classic characteristic of the disease is inflammation, which takes the form of brain lesions.

The immune system's T cells have long been implicated in disease progression, but the notion that B cells may also play a major role is relatively new.

With this new potential target in mind, researchers configured ocrelizumab to specifically focus on a protein (CD20) found on the surface of certain B cells.

To test the drug, Kappos and his team recruited patients aged 18 to 55 seeking MS treatment in 79 centers in 20 countries.

The patients were divided into four groups, treated with: a low dose of ocrelizumab (600 milligrams); a high dose of ocrelizumab (2,000 mg); a well-known MS inflammation treatment known as ""intramuscular interferon beta-1a""; or a sugar pill (placebo). After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted.

The result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups.

The number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What's more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo.

The investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug.

That said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative.

""In fact, there's nothing novel about this at all,"" he said. ""There is another drug, called rituximab, that's been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It's not better or worse. It's the same,"" Rodriguez noted.

""So bottom-line, I would not sell this as a major breakthrough in MS,"" cautioned Rodriguez. ""It's not.""

Funding for the study was provided by F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Biogen Idec. Inc.

MONDAY, Oct. 31, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors who listen to Mozart while performing colonoscopies may spot more precancerous growths, researchers suggest.

Better detection of these so-called adenomatous polyps could save lives, the study authors noted, as survival rates for colorectal cancer are better than 90 percent if the disease is detected early.

Previous research has shown that Mozart's music can provide a significant short-term boost to spatial-temporal reasoning, which involves a person's ability to compare and transform mental images in space and time. Researchers set out to determine if this phenomenon, called the ""Mozart Effect,"" played a role in the detection rates of precancerous polyps during colonoscopies.

In their small study, two doctors performed endoscopies either while listening to Mozart or with no music at all. Both doctors improved their detection rates of potentially dangerous adenomatous polyps when they listened to music compared with their pre-study (""baseline"") rates, the investigators found. But while both doctors had better results compared to their baseline rates, one doctor did slightly better in procedures without music than with music during the study.

Detection rates for the first doctor were about 67 percent while listening to music and 30 percent with no music. This was up from a baseline detection rate of 21 percent before the study began.

However, the second doctor had an adenoma detection rate of nearly 37 percent with Mozart and 40 percent without the music, compared with a baseline detection rate of 27 percent.

""Both endoscopists had higher adenoma detection rates listening to music when compared with their baseline rates,"" lead researcher Dr. Catherine Noelle O'Shea, of the University of Texas Health Science Center at Houston, said in an American College of Gastroenterology news release.

The study authors suggested that the findings could help reduce the number of people affected by invasive colorectal cancer -- the third most common cancer diagnosed in men and women in the United States, according to background information in the news release. When spotted early, potentially dangerous polyps can be removed during colonoscopies, preventing the development of disease.

""Adenoma detection rate is linked to a reduction in colorectal cancer incidence, so it is an important quality indicator for colonoscopy,"" said O'Shea. ""Anything we can do to get those rates up has the potential to save lives. While this is a small study, the results highlight how thinking outside the box -- in this case using Mozart -- to improve adenoma detection rates can potentially prove valuable to physicians and patients.""

The study was slated for presentation Monday at the American College of Gastroenterology's annual meeting in Washington, D.C. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

WEDNESDAY, Oct. 26, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental psoriasis treatment performed significantly better than the commonly prescribed medication methotrexate in a new clinical trial.

The drug briakinumab reduced psoriasis symptoms by at least 75 percent in nearly 82 percent of those taking it, compared to just 40 percent of those on methotrexate. But serious side effects were more common among the briakinumab users.

""Very high levels of response"" were observed and maintained throughout the study period, said lead researcher Dr. Kristian Reich, a professor of dermatology at the University of Gottingen and a managing partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg, both in Germany.

Results of the study are published in the Oct. 27 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was funded by the drug's manufacturer, Abbott Laboratories.

Psoriasis affects about 5 million Americans, according to the U.S. National Institute of Arthritis and Musculoskeletal and Skin Diseases (NIAMS). The disease causes patches of thick, red, inflamed skin that have silvery scales. Psoriasis can affect any part of the body, including the skin, nails, genitals and inside the mouth, according to NIAMS.

The current study included 317 people with moderate to severe psoriasis. The study volunteers had had psoriasis for at least six months, and the condition affected at least 10 percent of their bodies.

Nearly half of the study participants were randomly selected to receive injections of briakinumab at a dose of 200 milligrams (mg) for the first and fourth week of the study, and 100 mg at week eight and every four weeks thereafter. The study lasted one year. The remaining volunteers were given between 5 mg and 25 mg of oral methotrexate weekly.

After six months, nearly 82 percent of those in the briakinumab group had at least a 75 percent improvement in the psoriasis area-and-severity index (PASI), a commonly used measurement to assess the severity of psoriasis. Slightly less than 40 percent of those on methotrexate had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score, according to the study.

After a year, about 66 percent of those taking briakinumab had a 75 percent improvement in their PASI score compared to almost 24 percent for those on methotrexate, according to the study.

Briakinumab works by dampening the immune system response that causes psoriasis, said Bruce Bebo, director of research and medical programs for the National Psoriasis Foundation, based in Portland, Ore.

More serious infections were seen in people taking briakinumab (2.6 percent) vs. those taking methotrexate (1.8 percent). There were also two cases of cancer in people taking briakinumab and none in the methotrexate group. However, the researchers said these differences weren't statistically significant.

""Cancer risk is extremely hard to define, and this study was not powered to detect any difference in the risk of developing a malignancy,"" said Bebo.

He said that in an earlier trial of briakinumab, some unexplained major adverse cardiac events occurred. At the time, Abbott withdrew its application for approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration pending further research. In the current study, no serious cardiovascular events were reported.

Of the increased infections and cancers, Reich said, ""Although these differences were not statistically significant, they lead to questions regarding a favorable risk-benefit profile of the drug.""

Research on briakinumab is continuing. An ongoing three-year trial involves 248 people from the current study.

For people living with psoriasis, Bebo said the message from this study is that ""dramatic progress has been made from where we were just five years ago.""

"Oct. 26, 2011 -- An experimental drug called briakinumab appears to be more effective than a standard medication for treating psoriasis, a new study shows.

The study is published in the New England Journal of Medicine. It included psoriasis patients who were assigned to get monthly injections of briakinumab or to take methotrexate pills weekly.

The result: The thick, red, flaking skin lesions that are characteristic of psoriasis cleared up in about three times as many patients who got briakinumab as those who got methotrexate.

""This drug has had, in this trial, the highest efficacy we have ever seen with any biologic in psoriasis before,"" says study researcher Kristian Reich, MD. Biologics are genetically engineered proteins derived from human genes.

Reich, a partner at Dermatologikum Hamburg and professor of dermatology, venerology, and allergology at Georg-August-University in Gottingen, Germany, says that after a year of therapy, roughly 60% of the 154 patients in the briakinumab group had near or complete clearance of their skin lesions. Those same results were achieved by about 10% to 20% of 163 patients in the methotrexate group.

""This is unheard of,"" Reich tells WebMD. ""We in dermatology have never spoken about remission before. But with this drug, the word 'remission' is on the table.""

But as successful as the drug appears to be for some patients, it may come with a significant risk. Patients taking briakinumab had more serious infections and more cancers than those taking methotrexate.

""We had amazing responses,"" Reich says. ""Obviously, the price that this comes with is the increased rate of serious infections and cancers.""

Abbott, the company that makes briakinumab, announced in January that it was withdrawing its bid to get the drug approved in the U.S. and Europe after regulators asked to see more robust proof that the medication was safe.

At that time, the company said it wanted to evaluate the ""next steps"" for briakinumab and might try for approval again at a later date.

""This is the single most effective drug we've had in psoriasis, ever,"" says Kenneth B. Gordon, MD, a dermatologist and clinical associate professor at the University of Chicago's Pritzker School of Medicine.

"A study believed to be the largest of its kind suggests that the physical aspects of yoga are effective at relieving low back pain, but it didn't find any evidence that yoga provided broader mental benefits.

The study, funded by the National Institutes of Health's National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine, was published online Monday in the Archives of Internal Medicine. It was lead by researchers at Seattle's Group Health Research Institute.

A study believed to be the largest of its kind suggests that the physical aspects of yoga are effective at relieving low back pain, but didn't find any evidence yoga provided broader mental benefits. Jennifer Corbett-Dooren explains on Lunch Break.

Smaller studies in the past have suggested that yoga, which involves stretching exercises along with a mental component of deep breathing and other relaxation techniques, was moderately effective at easing symptoms of chronic lower back pain.

It was thought the combination of stretching and relaxation relieved back pain, according to previous studies.

But the current study found both yoga and stretching were equally as effective, suggesting the benefits of yoga are attributable to the physical benefits of stretching and not to its mental components, said the study's lead author, Karen J. Sherman, senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute.

It involved 228 adults with chronic, low back pain that didn't have a specific cause such as a spinal disc problem. They were divided into three groups to compare two types of classes with patients using a self-care book that provided instruction on exercises and stretches to help treat lower pain.

The people who took classes may have been more likely to complete the exercises. More than 80% of the participants in the self-care group reported reading some of the book and doing some exercises, but time spent on the exercises was typically less than the class groups. ""They need that class format to get started,"" Ms. Sherman said.

About 50% of patients in the yoga or stretching classes reported feeling much better or completely better in relation to their back pain and function compared to about 20% of patients in the self-care group, said Ms. Sherman.

Twice as many patients in the yoga and stretching groups reported decreased medication use during the study compared to the self-care group.

About 90 patients each were randomly assigned to attend 75-minute weekly yoga classes or weekly stretching classes for 12 weeks. The people who attended the classes were also instructed to practice for 20 minutes a day at home in between classes.

Another group involved 45 patients who were given a 200-page book with advice on exercising, lifestyle modifications and managing flare-ups.

The type of yoga used in the study was viniyoga, a style of hatha yoga, that adapts exercises for each person's physical condition. The stretching classes involved 15 stretches targeting the lower back and legs were which held for a full minute repeated for a total of 52 minutes of stretching.

The study measured changes in back pain and functional status at the beginning of the study and at six weeks, 12 weeks and six months.

"""If you have a technique to soften the cataract, there appears to be less chance of damage [to the eye ],"" Salz says.

""There certainly seems to be a benefit to using the laser,"" says American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) spokesman James Salz, MD, clinical professor of ophthalmology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He reviewed the findings for WebMD.

Standard vs. Laser Cataract Surgery

More than 1.5 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. One in three mostly older Americans will have the surgery at some point in their lives.

The surgery is performed to remove the natural lens of the eye after it has become clouded over time. A permanent artificial lens is then implanted to replace the natural lens and provide appropriate vision correction for each patient.

Currently, most aspects of cataract surgery, including the initial incision and the breakup and removal of the clouded lens from the lens capsule, are performed manually by the surgeon. An ultrasound instrument with a vibrating needle is used to break up the cataracts, and a vacuum sucks them out.

The new studies looked at using the so-called femtosecond laser to deliver near-infrared light to fragment the cataract into tiny segments prior to removal.

""The idea is that all the surgeon will have to do is remove the pieces with a vacuum,"" says researcher Mark Packer, MD, of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. ""Ideally, you won't need ultrasound, or at least you'll need less ultrasound.""

That's important because ultrasound can cause collateral damage to the eye, he says. It can hinder recovery and cause clouding of the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye.

Although approved by the FDA, the femtosecond laser procedure is not widely used in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",1

SUNDAY, Oct. 23, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Older women who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- such as aspirin or ibuprofen -- appear to have a lower risk of death from colorectal cancer than women who don't use these medications, a large new study suggests.

Women who reported using these drugs, called NSAIDs, at the beginning of the study and three years later had a roughly 30 percent lower rate of death from colorectal cancer than women who did not take the drugs, or women who took them at only one of these two points in time, according to an American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) news release.

""Our results suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is associated with lower colorectal cancer mortality among postmenopausal women who use these medications more consistently and for longer periods of time,"" Anna Coghill, a doctoral student in epidemiology at the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said in the news release.

In the study, researchers examined the use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs among more than 160,000 postmenopausal women in relation to deaths from colorectal cancer.

Study participants were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative, which ""represents a large and well-characterized cohort [group] of postmenopausal women, and the medication data collected in this cohort made it possible for us to investigate multiple types, durations and strengths of NSAID use,"" Coghill explained.

The researchers confirmed 2,119 cases of colorectal cancer and 492 deaths due to the disease.

""The results of our study help to further clarify the importance of different durations of NSAID use over time for the risk for dying from colorectal cancer,"" Coghill noted in the news release.

While the study found an association between NSAID use and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, it did not prove a cause-and-effect.

The findings were slated for presentation on Sunday at the AACR International Conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research, in Boston.

Experts say that for studies presented at medical meetings, data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, has developed a device to tackle another common health problem: erectile dysfunction.

The medical device maker said it completed an initial feasibility study of 30 men, average age of 60, who suffered from erectile dysfunction (ED). After three months the results were promising, the company said.

The stent — a tiny wire mesh tube similar to those used to prop open heart arteries — was placed in the internal pudendal artery, which supplies blood to the penis.

The stent was delivered using a catheter threaded up to the pelvis, where the pudendal artery is located. It was placed in the artery, opening the vessel and allowing for better blood flow.

“ED is largely a vascular disease and that’s why Medtronic was interested in this,” said Dr. Jason Rogers of UC Davis Medical Center, one of the researchers of the company-sponsored trial.

There are an estimated 30 million men in the United States who have ED and 300 million worldwide.

Rogers said up to 50 percent of men discontinue drug therapy — which includes Viagra, Levitra and Cialis — either because it did not work or because they could not tolerate side effects, including lowering of blood pressure.

He also noted that men who take certain drugs for heart disease cannot use the popular pills.

“There’s a real unmet clinical need,” Rogers said.

Initial findings showed two-thirds of men who underwent the 1- to 2-hour procedure improved by at least 4 points on the 30-point Internal Index of Erectile Dysfunction scale, he said.

There were no adverse events reported up to three months later, but Rogers acknowledged that risks may become evident much later.

“This is still investigational and requires more research. It is the inception of an entirely new way of treating ED that has never been seen before,” he said.

Rogers said it could be several years before Medtronic undertakes a much larger late-stage trial.

Medtronic shares gained 2.3 percent to close at $33.64 on Wednesday.",0

MONDAY, Oct. 17 (HealthDay News) -- Women who undergo mammograms every two years instead of every year have fewer false-positive results, but the trade-off is a slightly higher risk of being diagnosed with late-stage breast cancer, new research finds.

""After 10 years, biennial mammograms reduced the risk of false-positives by about one-third and, over a lifetime, that would accumulate,"" said Rebecca Hubbard, lead author of a study published in the Oct. 18 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine and funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute.

But the increase in breast cancer diagnoses wasn't statistically significant, she said. And breast cancer stage was only analyzed in women who actually developed cancer.

On the other hand, among roughly 170,000 women screened between 1994 and 2006 and followed for a decade, more than half who received annual mammograms were called back at least once because of a false-positive result, and 7 to 9 percent were recommended to get a biopsy.

Fewer women -- about 42 percent -- who had biennial screening were called back because of a false-positive, while 4.8 percent were referred for a biopsy.

Having a previous mammogram for comparison purposes sliced the rate of false-positives in half.

For the study, researchers used data from NCI's Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium.

Women undergoing once-yearly mammograms need to be prepared for possible call backs, and being prepared may reduce the anxiety around such an event, the authors stated.

This is the latest volley in an ongoing debate about when to start mammography screening in women.

In 2009, the U.S. Preventative Services Task Force (USPSTF), a government-sponsored organization, startled the world by recommending that women start mammograms at age 50 instead of 40 and then only once every two years rather than once a year.

The move released an outcry in the medical community, leading to this and other studies to try to determine the best timing for mammograms, the only screening tool shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer.

The new study gives a nod in the direction of the UPSTF recommendations, but practitioners aren't necessarily ready to let go of the long-standing once-a-year recommendation.

Hubbard, an assistant investigator with Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, Wash., said she ""definitely wouldn't make a specific recommendation for individual women. I feel it's really an individual choice where a woman needs to think about her own risk tolerance and also their own breast cancer risk.""

""This gives women more information as to what the risks and benefits of mammography are,"" added Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""It's a personal choice as to whether or not you absolutely have to screen at 40. As breast surgeons, we're still going to advocate that mammograms start at 40.""

A second study in the same journal issue looked at more than 800,000 U.S. women screened from 2000 to 2006 and found that newer digital mammography and older film mammography were similarly accurate in finding cancer in women ages 50 through 79.

But in premenopausal women in their 40s, who tend to have denser breast tissue, digital mammography performed better. Again, though, the risk of false-positives was higher than with film mammography.

""There was a trade-off here as well,"" said Hubbard, who was also an author of this study. ""In general, in women aged 50 to 79 the two modalities performed pretty equivalently, but in younger women the sensitivity of digital mammography was a little bit better so it found more cancers, but there was also a bigger decrease in specificity [resulting in more false-positives].""

"Researchers analyzed data from nearly 170,000 women who had their first screening mammogram at age 40 to 59 years and almost 4,500 women with invasive breast cancer . Information about the women and their mammograms came from the Breast Cancer Surveillance Consortium, funded by the National Cancer Institute.

The task force says the decision to start regular, biennial mammograms before age 50 should be an individual choice based on each patient's situation. Meanwhile, the American Cancer Society continues to recommend that women get mammograms every year beginning at age 40.

The frequency of screening mammograms -- and the appropriate age to begin them -- has been debated since the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force in 2009 recommended that women routinely get screening mammograms every other year starting at age 50.

Oct. 17, 2011 -- Getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a false alarm, a new study shows.

False-Positives Are Common

After 10 years of annual screening, more than half of women will be called back at least once for another mammogram. And 7% to 9% will be told they should have a biopsy because of something suspicious that turns out not to be cancer, the researchers concluded.

Those false-positives may cause inconvenience and anxiety, and biopsies can cause pain and scarring, the researchers note.

They found a small but not significant increase in the chance that women diagnosed with breast cancer had a more advanced case if they underwent screening every other year instead of every year.

The study wasn't really designed to answer the question of which screening regimen is best, study researcher Rebecca Hubbard, PhD, says. Its main message, Hubbard says, is that call-backs (or recalls) for false-positive results are common, so women shouldn't panic when they occur.

""In most cases, a recall doesn't mean you have cancer,"" says Hubbard, a biostatistician at the Group Health Research Institute in Seattle. ""Hopefully, there will be less anxiety about getting a recall.""

Women can halve their risk of a call-back for a false-positive if the interpreting radiologist has previous mammograms for comparison, the researchers found.

Ideally, Hubbard says, primary care doctors should talk to women about what to expect from annual and biennial screening before they get their first mammogram.",1

TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer.

However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times.

""If you want to add ginger to part of a healthy diet, that's great. But you can't make any conclusions about definite health benefits"" based on the study findings, said lead author Suzanna M. Zick, a naturopathic physician and research associate professor at University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor.

The study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was published online Oct. 11 in Cancer Prevention Research.

Ginger, an herb, is found in supplements and in many foods such as ginger snaps and Asian dishes. Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it's ""likely safe,"" although some people may develop mild side effects.

Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease.

In the new study, Zick's team randomly assigned 30 people to take pills containing 2 grams of ground ginger root extract or a ""dummy"" placebo pill each day for 28 days. They measured the level of inflammation in the participants' intestines before and after the test period.

The amount of ginger in the pills is equivalent to 20 grams of raw ginger root, the authors said. That is probably well beyond what most people would eat in their regular diet, Zick noted. As for cost, she said that a month's supply of similar ginger supplements typically runs about $10 to $30.

The researchers found that the level of inflammation in the subjects who took the ginger pills fell by an average of 28 percent, while staying about the same in those who took the placebo.

If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, ""if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead,"" but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer.

Dr. Andrew Chan, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, said the findings are promising because they hint at how ginger may prevent colon cancer.

It's already clear that people with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease are at higher risk of colon cancer, he noted. ""We know there are anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin that appear to have anti-cancer properties. And we know there are certain basic mechanisms which seem to be common to both inflammation and cancer,"" he said.

Still, Chan said, ""it's much too early to tell whether ginger has anti-cancer properties.""

"Oct. 10, 2011 -- A healthy chocolate habit -- about two chocolate bars a week -- appears to help women reduce their risk of stroke, according to new research.

The new Swedish study echoes previous research in men and women. It also adds new information.

""The protection started at more than 45 grams [about 1.5 ounces] a week,"" says researcher Susanna C. Larsson, PhD, of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden.

The group eating the most chocolate got the most benefit, reducing stroke intake by 20%. In this group, the median intake (half ate more, half less) was about 2.3 ounces a week.

The research is published in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

While other studies have found a link between eating chocolate and reduced stroke risk, this research found a slight difference in protection, depending on type of stroke. Those who ate the most chocolate were protected a bit more from strokes caused by hemorrhage than strokes caused by obstruction such as blood clots. Larsson isn't sure why.",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - British scientists conducting early-stage research have found that a potential new drug from GlaxoSmithKline could treat mixed-lineage leukemia(MLL) — the most common form of leukemia in babies.

Signage is pictured on the company headquarters of GlaxoSmithKline in west London July 21, 2008. REUTERS/Toby Melville

In a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukemia genes.

“This ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemias,” said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study.

Kevin Lee, head of epigenetics discovery research at GSK, who also worked on the study, said he too was excited about the findings, although it will probably be many years before the drug could potentially reach the market.

“Even though this is still lab-based ... it validates the idea of developing small molecules against epigenetic switches,” he said in an emailed comment.

“It is important to remember we will need to be successful on a number of additional steps before we can move this from the lab to testing this compound in humans.”

MLL leukemia is thought to account for up to 80 percent of cases of acute leukemia in children below two years old, and up to one in 10 cases in adults.

Most patients don’t respond well to standard leukemia treatments and often the cancer comes back.

The disease is caused when a gene called MLL gets fused to another gene. This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new “fusion protein” that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia.

Kouzarides’s team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognize certain chemical “tags” on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged.

Using I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials.

“We urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,” said Lesley Walker, CRUK’s director of information.

“Although this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly toward clinical trials in patients.”

Leukemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children. According to Cancer Research UK, eight out of 10 children with leukemia in Britain now survive for five years or more, compared with one in 10 in the late 1960s.",0
"Sept. 14, 2011 -- Low doses of the muscle relaxant cyclobenzaprine, taken at bedtime, help people with fibromyalgia sleep better and feel less pain, according to a small study.

""Bedtime treatment of fibromyalgia patients with low-dose cyclobenzaprine was safe and appears to be effective,"" says Seth Lederman, MD, president of TONIX Pharmaceuticals, which funded the study.

Fibromayalgia is a condition marked by fatigue, disturbed sleep, and pain. About 5 million Americans have fibromyalgia.

Cyclobenzaprine, marketed in higher doses by others as Amrix, Fexmid, and Flexeril, is already widely used ''off-label'' for patients with fibromyalgia, Lederman says. ""Off-label"" refers to the practice of prescribing medicines to treat conditions not been specifically approved by the FDA.

TONIX is developing a lower-dose version and improving the formula, Lederman says.

However, a rheumatologist not connected to the study does not expect the new drug to be a ''game-changer.""

The results of the study are published online in The Journal of Rheumatology.",1
"In the four-month study, the group randomly assigned to receive intranasal insulin twice a day either improved slightly or remained the same in tests of memory and assessments of their ability to handle day-to-day activities. The lower dose seemed more effective than the higher one. Those who received placebos got worse.

A third also had scans to assess their brains’ use of glucose. One hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease is reduced metabolism in the brain, which shows up on scans as less use of glucose, the fuel for brain cells. In this assessment, those getting insulin used more glucose in their brains; those taking placebos used less.

For years, the study’s principal investigator, Suzanne Craft, has studied insulin’s effects in Alzheimer’s. She is professor of psychiatry at the University of Washington in Seattle and director of the memory disorders clinic at the Veterans Affairs Puget Sound Health Care System.

Brain cells need insulin, Dr. Craft said. And conditions in which the body makes too little insulin or is resistant to its effects — diabetes, prediabetes, even untreated high-blood pressure — are associated with an increased risk of Alzheimer’s.

In addition, she said, beta amyloid, a toxic protein that accumulates in the brain of Alzheimer’s patients, seems to tie up insulin in the brain.

So, Dr. Craft reasoned, perhaps if more insulin could be put into the brains of people with the degenerative brain disease, their memories and ability to function might improve. The problem was to find a way to get more insulin to the brain but not to the body.

The solution was a special device made by Kurve Technology that delivers a spray of insulin deep into the nose. From there the hormone travels along the path of nerves into the brain.

The investigators first tried a single dose of insulin delivered via nasal spray to the brains of people with Alzheimer’s disease. Their memories improved temporarily. Then they tried giving insulin daily for three weeks. Again, the hormone seemed to help. That led to the current study, lasting four months.

But Dr. Martha Daviglus of Northwestern University, who led a panel last year that assessed published papers on preventing and treating Alzheimer’s, urged caution. In her field, cardiovascular medicine, she has seen many exciting findings in small studies that fall apart in larger or longer ones.

Now Dr. Craft wants to test insulin again in a much more extensive study. .

In the meantime, she cautions Alzheimer’s patients not to rush out and try to take insulin. It is too soon to say if the treatment is even safe, she said. And patients would need a special device to get it deep into the nose. Kurve’s device is not yet on the market.

“The individual person will not be able to get this device,” Dr. Craft said. But, she added, if her study goes forward, many will be able to participate in it.",1
"For women who like a nice glass of wine at the end of the day, there’s more good news: Even middle-aged women can have about a drink a day of any kind of alcoholic beverage as part of what they do to try to stay healthy as they age, according to new research.

Qi Sun of the Harvard School of Public Health and his colleagues analyzed data collected from 13.984 female nurses participating in the Nurses’ Health Study, an ongoing study examining a variety of health issues.

In a paper published online Tuesday by the journal PLoS Medicine, the researchers found that those who consumed 15 grams or less of alcohol a day, which is the equivalent of one drink of any alcoholic beverage, when they were about 58 years old on average were more likely to have good overall health when they were about 70 years old. Those who drank between one-third and 1 drink per day five to seven days a week were almost 50 percent more likely to be in good health when they got older compared with those who did not imbibe.

That was after accounting for other factors, such as smoking. Good overall health was defined as having no major chronic diseases, such as heart disease or diabetes, as well as having no significant decline in their thinking or physical abilities.

“These data suggest that regular, moderate consumption of alcohol at midlife may be related to a modest increase in overall health status among women who survive to older ages,” the researchers wrote.

Now, the researchers stressed that wasn’t the case for women who consumed more than two drinks a day or four drinks or more at a time.

The findings fit with current federal dietary guidelines, which recommend up to one drink per day for women and just to two drinks per day for men.",1
"Sept. 6, 2011 -- ""A drink a day keeps disease away"" may be the new motto for middle-age women hoping to age gracefully.

A new study shows women who drank the equivalent of a beer or small glass of wine each day were less likely to develop chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, and diabetes as they got older compared to nondrinkers or those who drink four or more drinks at one time.

In the study, researchers looked at the effects of drinking alcohol at midlife on the risk of diseases commonly associated with aging in a group of 13,894 women enrolled in the Nurses' Health Study.

The women filled out questionnaires about what they ate and drank at midlife, about age 58. Researchers then analyzed health status information collected after the women turned 70.

After taking into account other factors that might affect health and disease risk, like smoking, researchers found women who drank light or moderate amounts of alcohol were less likely to develop chronic diseases as they aged.

For example, compared to nondrinkers, women who drank up to one alcoholic drink per day were 20% more likely to be disease-free at age 70 than nondrinkers.",0
"Cracking The Conundrum Of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome

Enlarge this image toggle caption iStockphoto.com iStockphoto.com

Nearly three decades have passed since the debate began about a series of symptoms that have come to be known as chronic fatigue syndrome. Its cause is still unknown, but over the years, researchers have identified various brain, immune system and energy metabolism irregularities involved. Some patients describe the syndrome as feeling like an ""unrelenting, unremitting flu.""

Doctors say some treatments can help. Arthur Barsky, a psychiatrist at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, says patients need to change how they experience symptoms — typically pain, insomnia and anxiety. When patients adopt a more positive attitude, Barsky points out, it often translates into greater confidence and more energy.

A study published this year in the Lancet found that a form of talk therapy, as well as exercise, offered relief for some patients. Researchers from the United Kingdom looked at cognitive behavior therapy, or CBT.

In the study, over 600 patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were assigned to different treatments. All of them received medical care for symptoms like pain, insomnia or anxiety.

Hear Joanne Silberner's Report Medical Mystery Of Chronic Fatigue Syndrome Returns

One group got counseled about how to pace activities. Another took part in an exercise program. And a third received the cognitive behavioral talk therapy. The therapy and the exercise group improved the most, reporting less fatigue, insomnia and anxiety.

Barsky says his patients do best when cognitive behavior therapy is also combined with gradually increased exercise. ""People need to begin to push themselves in the face of their fatigue, because if you don't, you become deconditioned and you get caught in a cycle which ... makes fatigue worse,"" says Barsky.

But he cautions against overdoing it. People should start with mild, gentle exercise like clearing the table, doing the dishes, or taking the dog for a short walk. Then, slowly build up to longer and more frequent walks, he says.

Lucinda Bateman is a doctor at the Fatigue Consultation Clinic in Salt Lake City who specializes in chronic fatigue syndrome.

She's skeptical about the Lancet study, pointing out that patients improved only moderately, and not much more than those who were counseled about pacing themselves. Bateman suggests her patients pace themselves, and try to do only as many activities as they can manage.

She says some patients get caught in a ""push and crash"" cycle. When symptoms abate and they feel better, they may go all out, exercising, doing errands and socializing. But soon that level of activity often comes to a crashing end and patients can relapse dramatically, even becoming bedridden for several days or longer.

Bateman takes also issue with CBT's implication that chronic fatigue syndrome is psychosomatic. We still don't know what exactly causes the syndrome. And, like most professionals who treat patients, Bateman eagerly awaits the day when science can finally pinpoint its cause.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Gentle yoga classes may help people with type 2 diabetes take off a small amount of weight and steady their blood sugar control, a small study suggests.

People perform yoga during a gathering calling for world peace, at Ibirapuera Park in Sao Paulo August 21, 2011. REUTERS/Nacho Doce

The study, of 123 middle-aged and older adults, found that those who added yoga classes to standard diabetes care shed a handful of pounds over three months. Meanwhile, their average blood sugar levels held steady — in contrast to the non-yoga-practicing “control” group, whose blood sugar levels rose.

The findings, reported in the journal Diabetes Care, do not suggest that yoga should replace other forms of exercise for people with type 2 diabetes — a disease commonly associated with obesity.

To really lose weight and rein in blood sugar, more-vigorous exercise would work better, according to Shreelaxmi V. Hegde of the Srinivas Institute of Medical Science and Research Center in Mangalore, India.

Among the 60 study participants who took yoga classes several times a week, the average BMI — a measure of weight in relation to height — declined from 25.9 to 25.4. A BMI between 25 and 30 is considered overweight.

“In our study the effect of yoga on BMI (body mass index) and blood sugar control was marginal,” Hegde, the lead researcher on the work, told Reuters Health in an email.

“But,” she added, “it should be noted that yoga controlled the blood sugar levels which otherwise rose in the control group.”

In addition to that, the study found, signs of so-called oxidative stress declined in the yoga group.

Oxidative stress refers to a situation where levels of reactive oxygen species or “free radicals” — damaging byproducts of energy use in cells — rise beyond the body’s capacity to neutralize them. Long-term oxidative stress is believed to contribute to a host of chronic diseases.

In this study, Hegde’s team measured participants’ blood levels of certain chemicals that reflect oxidative stress. They found that, on average, the yoga group’s levels of the chemicals dipped by 20 percent.

The significance of that is not clear. Hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time, it might lower the chances of diabetes complications, which include heart and kidney disease, nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes.

Further, long-term studies are needed to see whether that is the case, the researchers say.

According to Hegde, yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system — the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system.

There are caveats. The yoga used in this study was a gentle form, Hegde said, and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems; certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease, for example.

In the real world, yoga classes vary widely. Some are vigorous work-outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions.

Older adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions. In the U.S., hospitals and local community centers are increasingly offering such classes.

"The goal of the project is to develop a simple, accurate, noninvasive, and reproducible method for early identification of chronic heart failure, he tells WebMD.

""We saw two distinct patterns, one of which correlated with heart failure,"" says study leader Vasileios Kechagias, a PhD candidate at the University Hospital Jena.

The device has gas sensors that detect various odorous molecules in sweat. Specially developed software divides patients into groups depending on the pattern of molecules detected.

Aug. 30, 2011 (Paris) -- German researchers say they’re a step closer to developing an electronic nose that can distinguish between people who have heart failure and those who don't.

5 Million Have Heart Failure in U.S.

More than 5 million Americans have heart failure, which occurs when the heart muscle loses its ability to pump enough blood throughout the body. Fluid can back up into the lungs, leaving people short of breath.

The new study involved 27 people with heart failure so severe that they were comfortable only at rest, 25 people with less severe heart failure, and 28 healthy people.

The electronic nose correctly identified 89% of the people who had heart failure and 84% of people that didn't have the condition. Still, that means that 11% of cases would have been missed and 16% of people would have been told they had a life-threatening condition when they didn't.

The new device was about that accurate at differentiating between severe and less severe heart failure patients.

The findings were presented here at the European Society of Cardiology Congress 2011.

Frank Ruschitzka, MD, of Zurich University Hospital, tells WebMD that ideas that at first seem ""crazy"" can turn out to be lifesaving. ""We need people to swim against the stream. Someone had the idea to put three leads in a device and pace the heart; the pacemaker now saves millions of lives,"" he says.

""Still, much more work is needed before we will know if the electronic nose will make it to the clinic,"" says Ruschitzka, who moderated a news briefing to discuss the findings.

The researchers are now testing more than 1,000 patients and trying to identify the odorous molecules unique to heart failure patients, Kechagias says.",1

A new study reports that beer is an excellent recovery beverage for marathon runners. But you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet. The beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic.

Running a marathon is, of course, punishing to the body, causing muscle soreness and inflammation. Grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system, making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event. Some athletes, particularly in Europe, long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training, claiming that it helped them to recover, but no science existed to support the practice.

To study the matter, researchers at the Technical University of Munich approached healthy male runners, most in their early 40s, who were training for the Munich Marathon, and asked if they would — in the name of science — be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer. Two hundred seventy-seven men agreed, even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic. Only half of the group received the alcohol-free beer, however; the other half got a similarly flavored placebo. No one knew who was drinking what.

All of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half — about two to three pints — of their assigned beverage every day, beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward. The scientists, meanwhile, collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race, as well as immediately before to the start, at the finish line and on select days afterward. (These were an exceptionally obliging group of racers, it seems.) They monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men’s blood, to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running.

For the next two weeks, the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew. They also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time.

The men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage. “Incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was 3.25-fold lower” in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers, the scientists reported, in the journal Medicine & Science in Sports & Exercise. They also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation, as measured by various markers in their blood, and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group, an indication of overall better immune system health.

These effects matter, said Dr. Johannes Scherr, lead author of the study, because if a marathon runner’s body is less sore and inflamed after a race, and he doesn’t develop the sniffles, he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to. “It can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher (with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions)” in those drinking beer, he wrote in an e-mail response.

Just how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated. But, said Dr. Scherr, it almost certainly involves the beverage’s rich bouquet of polyphenols, chemical substances found in many plants that, among other things, “suppress viral replication” and “influence the innate immune system positively,” all beneficial for fighting off a cold.

Alcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols, too — “even more than nonalcoholic beer,” Dr. Scherr said — but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic. “We do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols,” he wrote. “Furthermore, it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day, especially not during strenuous training.” We all knew that, right?

Of course, other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise, and then underperformed in follow-up studies. Quercetin, for instance, a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins, was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals. But the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes. An analysis of 10 human studies of the supplement presented at the American College of Sports Medicine annual meeting in June concluded that quercetin supplementation “is very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage.”

But the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice. It began with human marathoners completing a punishing, unsimulated race, and showed demonstrable benefits, in terms of minimizing postrace damage.

All of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches. Asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets, Dr. Scherr said, “When I look at the results of our study, I would have to answer ‘Yes.’”

It’s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods, he added, like those training-table staples chokeberries and mangosteens, as well as pomegranates and grapes. “But with these foods you do not consume the minerals, fluid and carbohydrates,” he said, “so nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal” for everything, perhaps, apart from your well-deserved celebratory carouse after the race. For that, at least, the beer can be full-potency.",1
"Editor's note: Tune in as Dr. Sanjay Gupta explores the signs, tests and lifestyle changes that could make cardiac problems a thing of the past on ""The Last Heart Attack,"" Saturday, August 27, 8 and 11 p.m. ET on CNN.

Researchers in Canada have shown that a special cholesterol-lowering diet works well – even with only two nutritional counseling sessions over six months.

Making dietary changes like eating oat bran for breakfast, drinking soy milk instead of dairy, soy burgers in place of hamburgers, and fruit and nuts instead of a full lunch prompted a double-digit drop in both total cholesterol and LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol.

The study was published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Lead author Dr. David Jenkins, Canada research chair in nutrition and metabolism at the University of Toronto and St. Michael's Hospital, had previously shown the effectiveness of a cholesterol-lowering diet when all the meals were provided to participants.

""The question one had to address was how does this play out with people in the real world,"" Jenkins said in a telephone interview.

To put the diet to the real-world test, participants received a one-hour counseling session with a dietitian and an illustrated study booklet at the outset and, later, received a 30-40 minute follow up session.

""It was just advice,"" Jenkins said. Even so, the results were dramatic.

Total cholesterol dropped from 256 to 230, while the LDL or ""bad"" cholesterol decreased from 173 to 148, according to the study.

Jenkins said participants achieved these results even though compliance to the whole grain, vegetarian diet was only about 40%.

In addition to the soy protein, nuts and whole grains, participants in the diet were encouraged to eat peas, beans and lentils.

A control group advised to eat a vegetarian, low-saturated diet but not with the cholesterol-lowering foods a saw a slight dip in total cholesterol, from 249 to 246, and in LDL, from 167 to 161.

Both groups lost about four pounds over the six months.

The 351 participants in the study suffered from high cholesterol but were not on a cholesterol-lowering statin medication. The study was conducted from June 2007 to February 2009 at academic centers in Quebec City, Toronto, Winnipeg, and Vancouver.

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 17, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- People who have narrowed carotid arteries in the neck and show no symptoms may be at risk for stroke and not know it, but a simple ultrasound test can identify the problem, a new study suggests.

This condition, known as asymptomatic carotid stenosis, is caused by plaque build-up in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the brain. This can cause less blood to reach the brain and, in rare cases, may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain.

""Only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke,"" said lead researcher Dr. Raffi Topakian, from the Academic Teaching Hospital Wagner-Jauregg in Linz, Austria.

The problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke, he said. Most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol-lowering drugs, blood pressure-lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin, he added.

But those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy, which clears the carotid arteries of plaque.

""We found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke -- lower than 1 percent per year -- from patients at high risk of stroke -- higher than 8 percent per year,"" Topakian said.

The patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery, he said. Endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks, including stroke, with the procedure, Topakian said.

Those who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery, Topakian said. ""If they are too sick or frail for surgery, it makes no sense to do the ultrasound,"" he said.

In addition, people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound, Topakian said. This would include people with high cholesterol, high blood pressure or heart disease, he said. ""This test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery,"" Topakian said.

Of course, anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery, Topakian said. Warning signs include transient ischemic attacks (TIAS), or mini-strokes, which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days.

The report was published in the Aug. 17 online edition of Neurology.

For the study, a research team led by Topakian followed 435 people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years.

Each participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur. These included tiny blood clots, which pass into the brain, and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque, which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke.

Among those in the study, 38 percent had the fattier-than-normal plaque, 17 percent had signs of blood clots and 27 percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots, the researchers found.

In addition, over the two years of the study, 10 people had TIAs.

Moreover, people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque, and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was 10 times higher, Topakian's team found.

Nonetheless, some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery.

Dr. Lars Marquardt,a professor of surgery at the University of Erlangen-Nuremberg in Germany and co-author of an accompanying journal editorial, said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently.

Marquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment.

""Patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don't get the surgical procedure early enough, and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions,"" Marquardt said.

When treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis, Marquardt doesn't think the case has been made for distinguishing between high- and low-risk patients. Right now, the work done by Topakian's group is still ""experimental,"" he said.

Another expert, Dr. Larry B. Goldstein, director of the Duke University Stroke Center, said that ""what remains uncertain is whether surgical intervention would result in an overall improvement in stroke-free survival.""

""It is also unclear how optimal medical management [lifestyle changes in addition to anti-platelet medication and statins] would affect overall stroke and cardiovascular risk, and stroke-free survival,"" he said.

Both the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force and the American Heart Association currently recommend against general population screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis, Goldstein noted.

"(CNN) -- Most heart attacks strike with no warning, but doctors now have a clearer picture than ever before of who is most likely to have one, says Dr. Arthur Agatston, a Miami cardiologist and author of the best-selling South Beach diet books.

Agatston says relatively new imaging tests give real-time pictures showing whether plaque is building up in key blood vessels, alerting doctor and patient to an increased risk of a potentially deadly heart attack.

""Unless you do the imaging, you are really playing Russian roulette with your life,"" he said.

Agatston invented one of the imaging tests, the coronary calcium scan, which looks at plaque in the arteries leading to the heart. Plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack. (Agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan.)

The other imaging test Agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery, looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain. Plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke.

American Heart Association: Learn and live

Both tests are non-invasive and outpatient, although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation.

One large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional Framingham Risk Score, which considers age, cigarette smoking, blood pressure, total cholesterol and HDL, the ""good"" cholesterol.

Agatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age 50, like a colonoscopy, or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease.

Most hospitals now offer the imaging tests, some at less than $100 for both, and they are often covered by insurance.

Cardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease, determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol, blood pressure, lifestyle and family history.

High-risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol-lowering statin medication, but many doctors don't think low-risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan.

""There is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk, which may be as much as 50% of the population,"" said Dr. Erin Michos, a cardiologist at the Ciccarone Center for the Prevention of Heart Disease at Johns Hopkins University

A good candidate for a coronary calcium scan, she says, would be a 50-year-old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack.

""Do you put this 50-year-old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense (and) side effects for the next four decades of his life, or do you further refine how far at risk he is?"" she asked.

A calcium score would answer that question, she says.

There's a third test Agatston likes: a $65 blood test that looks at a patient's LDL, or bad cholesterol. LDL particles come in different sizes, and patients with a lot of small-particle LDL are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels, Agatston says. Alternately, patients with large LDL particles do not tend to accumulate plaque.

""There are a lot of little old ladies in their 80s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels. They have very large particles, and they don't get into the vessel wall,"" Agatston says.

These new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle, and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication.

""One of the best-kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices. It's doable,"" Agatston says.

"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Blood injections, especially of platelet-rich blood, into the affected area help relieve the pain associated with “tennis elbow” where other treatment methods have failed, according to a Greek study.

Analogous blood injections, in which the patient’s own blood is taken and then injected into a specific area of the body, is used to help harness the healing power of blood to treat the degeneration of tendons. Platelet-rich plasma (PRP) is blood that has been spun in a centrifuge to separate the blood cells.

“There is now a solution for patients suffering from unrelenting ‘tennis elbow,’” said Christos Thanasas from Henry Dunant Hospital, Athens, who led the study.

“Whole blood treatment is a god alternative in remote areas or in health systems that do not support financially the use of PRP,” he told Reuters Health in an email.

Thanasas and his colleagues compared the effectiveness of single local injections of PRP under ultrasound guidance with autologous blood injections in 28 patients with tennis elbow, formally known as lateral elbow epicondylitis.

Visual analog pain scores at 6 weeks after the injections improved by a mean 3.8 points or 61.47 percent in patients who had the PRP injections compared to the autologous blood group, a mean 2.5 points or 41.6 percent improvement.

Both groups experienced more improvement at 3 and 6 months after the injections, with no significant in pain scores between the treatments.

The findings were published in The American Journal of Sports Medicine.

“PRP is probably the best treatment for chronic refractory lateral epicondylitis if it is used after classical types of treatment like rest, braces, nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs, cortisone injections or physiotherapy have all failed,” Thanasas said.

The last resort remains surgery.

Thanasas added that further studies are needed to see how and when the PRP therapy is most effective, adding that he and his colleagues are about to start trials of PRP therapy in which different concentrations of white blood cells are used to see how this affects the regeneration of tendons.",1

MONDAY, Aug. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A traditional Chinese herbal treatment may reduce fever from H1N1 (""swine flu"") influenza just as well as the prescription medication Tamiflu, a new study suggests.

""For thousands of years, Chinese herbs have been used to treat influenza,"" study co-authors Dr. Chen Wang and Dr. Bin Cao, of Beijing Chao-Yang Hospital, Capital Medical University, in China, said in an email. ""The pandemic influenza 2009 gave us the opportunity to evaluate a standard Chinese herb formula"" designed to target the flu, they added.

Cao and Wang, who specialize in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology, said the herbal recipe -- known as maxingshigan-yinqiaosan (M-Y) -- is easily accessible throughout China and much less expensive than Tamiflu (oseltamivir).

However, finding the medicine in the United States is difficult, if not impossible, given that it contains the stimulant ephedra. The United States has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications, such as heart attack, stroke and even death, related to its use as a weight-loss supplement.

The authors discuss their findings in the Aug. 16 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The 2009 H1N1 (""swine flu"") pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe, resulting in nearly 18,000 deaths, the authors said.

Per World Health Organization (WHO) recommendations, in most instances, Tamiflu was the treatment of choice, where it was available. However, it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world, such as rural China, where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment.

The M-Y flu preparation is composed of 12 herbs: ephedrae, zhimu, qinghao, shigao, yinhua, huangqin, chaoxingren, lianqiao, bohe, zhebeimu, niubangzi and gancao.

To compare the relative effectiveness of M-Y and Tamiflu in treating H1N1 influenza, the authors focused on 410 previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a ""very mild"" form of the illness.

The men and women were relatively young, with an average age of 19. They were being treated in 11 different medical facilities across four Chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic, between July and November of 2009, to prevent spreading the flu, not because their symptoms were severe.

Within 72 hours of the onset of symptoms, the patients were assigned to one of four five-day treatment groups. One group was given 75 milligrams of Tamiflu twice a day in capsule form; a second group received 200 milliliters of M-Y four times a day in liquid form; a third group took the same dosages of Tamiflu and M-Y together; and a fourth group received no treatment.

All of the herbs were screened for quality, and the M-Y mixture was deemed to meet Chinese safety standards.

The results: Both M-Y and Tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever, whether administered on their own or in combination.

All three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever, the authors said, noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when M-Y and Tamiflu were given together. However, none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control, and side effects were minimal in all cases.

Even though the ephedra-containing herbal is not readily available in the United States, the M-Y herbal formula is available in many countries besides China, including Korea, Japan, India and Germany, the study authors noted.

Duffy MacKay, vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, which represents the dietary supplement industry, believes that fears over ephedra's use as a weight-control agent have overlooked ""its more traditional and much safer"" role as a medicine against lung inflammation.

MacKay said that in China, traditional medicine is ""seamlessly integrated"" into everyday medical practice.

""Here in the U.S., we do things differently,"" he said. ""We have our prescription drugs on the one hand, and then we have dietary supplements on the other.""

But, MacKay continued, ""it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently. Tamiflu works to stop viral replication. But the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable. And those are two very different goals,"" he noted.

""So our advice,"" MacKay added, ""is that because H1N1 can be very serious, it's very important to see your doctor. And once you're under the care of your licensed physician there's certainly a lot of things in the world of botanicals that might help.""

"Of course, Hologic has done some selling of its own. The firm, which markets itself as “The Women’s Health Company,” makes other products, including a 2-D digital mammography machine, a test that assesses risk of preterm labor, gynecological products, including Adiana (a permanent contraception technique), and widely used equipment that measures bone density. But 3-D mammography could become its flagship, because for the moment it owns the entire market – although other companies, including powerhouse GE, are developing their own 3-D machines, Hologic is the only one with FDA approval thus far. Of course, given the sluggish economy and the continuing state of uncertainty around American health care, persuading hospitals to upgrade may be challenging. So perhaps it’s not surprising that the company’s PowerPoint presentation to the FDA included the unsubtle phrase “huge breakthrough,” or that the first American patient to undergo 3-D mammography – Laura Lang, a polished 55-year-old Boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor – did so in front of a CBS camera crew last February.

Indeed they do. They’re catching on like – well, it’s not a slow burn. The device earned Food and Drug Administration approval on February 11, and for a short time it was available only at MGH. Now it is available in at least nine states, three of which have multiple sites, and most of the several dozen hospitals around the United States that assisted with clinical trials are planning to buy systems, too. The images aren’t the only selling point. The early data are compelling as well. In studies presented to the FDA, radiologists reported a 7 percent improvement in their ability to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous cases when they used the new system. If that sounds unimpressive, consider that 39 million women are screened each year; any significant reduction in callbacks for additional testing would mean hundreds of thousands of women would be spared painful, and expensive, follow-up.

Dr. Elizabeth Rafferty is trying not to lapse into rhapsodic cliches. “I don’t want to call it a magic bullet, because that would oversell,” she says. “It’s not a panacea.” Then, five minutes later: “I don’t want to say it’s catching on like wildfire.” After a few minutes more, though, Rafferty can’t help herself. She lets her enthusiasm loose. “People have been waiting for it for a long time,” she says. “It’s a step, but it’s a step by a person who has a stride of 7 feet.” “It” is a 3-D mammography machine, the Selenia Dimensions system, one of which sits in the breast imaging clinic at Massachusetts General Hospital that Rafferty, a radiologist, runs. The machine, which is made by the Bedford company Hologic and developed partly at MGH under Rafferty’s supervision, produces images that are so vivid and clear they seem to speak out loud: “Hey, right here! This is a tumor!” If you look at enough of them, you may become convinced that you don’t need medical training to spot a case of breast cancer or distinguish a false positive on a mammogram from a true one. The distinction seems that clear. “If you can tell the difference as a non-radiologist, imagine how a radiologist feels,” says Rafferty. “The images sort of sell themselves.”

Much of the criticism focused on the data the task force had used to make its decision, which consisted largely of the results from prospective, randomized clinical trials conducted in the United States. Trials like this are the gold standard of medical evidence. They are also expensive and time-consuming, and thus hard to come by. The most recent such trial looking at mammography and mortality in the United States was published in the 1980s. “A lot of the people on the task force are my friends, and I have tremendous respect for them, but this was a big point where we differed,” says Brawley. “The standard type of mammography that’s used all over the country today may very well be better than what was used in that trial. So the outcomes may be better, too.” The studies the task force had chosen to examine showed that screening beginning at age 40 had little impact on mortality while at the same time generating a significant number of false positives. Those data were complete and comprehensive. But, says Brawley, they were outdated.

The task force wasn’t expecting a firestorm. That, however, was what it got. Breast cancer advocacy groups mutinied, saying the guidelines would cause significant numbers of women to go undiagnosed for years, some of them fatally. Politicians started giving scary speeches about rationing health care. Many radiologists – including the MGH department as a whole – rejected the new guidelines. Daniel Kopans, a world leader in breast imaging (he wrote the textbook of that name) and a radiologist at MGH, now says that the panel didn’t “understand mammography screening.” Furthermore, he adds, the new guidelines had “no biological or scientific reason” behind them.

The last time someone tried to improve the way American women are screened for breast cancer, it turned into a national debacle. In November 2009, the US Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed group of doctors charged with making recommendations that often influence what insurers will pay for, updated its guidelines for mammography. Previously, it had advised women to begin annual or biannual screening at 40. The new guidelines pushed that age to 50, emphasizing that starting earlier should be an individual choice.

Debates about mammography are often so emotionally charged that this type of nuance goes missing. “I think some of our rhetoric – medicine’s in general, and also that of advocates?– has made people think that every metastatic breast cancer is a failure of the woman to get a mammogram or of a doctor to read a mammogram correctly,” says Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society and a professor at Emory University’s School of Medicine in Atlanta. “In reality, yes, mammography does save lives – but it is far from perfect. It’s not as good as many people think it is.” So if the new 3-D mammography isn’t perfect, just how good is it?

But the company, and the rest of us, should be careful not to overhype 3-D mammography. As Rafferty says, it’s not a panacea. The technology does come with costs, financial and medical. A fully equipped 3-D machine runs on average $474,541, not including the annual service fee Hologic charges for maintenance, and even hospitals that already own an upgradeable 2-D system made by Hologic have to pay about $125,000 to get it adapted for 3-D use. There are also costs in the sense of risks: Women who get a combo 2-D and 3-D mammogram, the protocol that confers the most dramatic jump in benefits, are exposed to twice as much X-ray radiation as the norm (albeit still an amount that’s under the FDA’s permitted limit). And no one yet knows if the new technique will actually save lives.

Is Hologic's 3-D mammography machine likely to fare better? There are reasons to think it will. Unlike MRI, which requires an injection with contrast dye and an hour in the imaging machine, it isn’t an ordeal – or at least it’s no worse than a conventional mammogram. (Yes, you still have to endure the dreaded clamp.) And it seems to be more effective than its most similar precursor, the 2-D digital technique. Early data from Rafferty’s trial showed that the same group of women who did benefit from 2-D digital benefited even more dramatically from 3-D. (It’s worth noting that this is not a small group of people. Fifty percent of women are in what the American Cancer Society considers the “intermediate zone” of risk, which overlaps considerably with the group that saw some benefit in DMIST.) Perhaps more important, even the women who didn’t see any improvement in accuracy with 2-D get a small boost with 3-D over film. And 3-D seems to be both more sensitive and more specific – improvement in one area doesn’t have to come at the cost of the other.

But when the definitive trial of 2-D digital techniques, called DMIST, was published in 2005, tracking nearly 50,000 patients, it didn’t provide the answers that advocates had been expecting. Digital mammography did seem to perform more accurately than film in women who were younger than 50, women who were pre- or perimenopausal, and women with dense breast tissue. But when all women were considered as a group, that benefit disappeared. On the whole, it turned out, digital just didn’t live up to the way it had been sold.

When 2-D digital mammography was introduced in 2000, doctors hoped it would vault over those problems. (Well, most of them. The cost concern was still present: Digital mammography machines were five times as expensive as film ones.) The marketing materials suggested it already had. An ad for GE’s 2-D digital system that ran during the Summer Olympics called it a “major new breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer.” Digital technology, the thinking went, would show nuances that film never could, because it could render, literally, many more shades of gray.

The problem, however, was that each time they introduced a new imaging tool for breast cancer, they found that they could not advance on one front without taking a step backward on the other. “First there was ultrasound,” says Rafferty. “We did find more cancers, but we also found so many false positives that it was untenable.” Then there was MRI, which had the same problem – and it was 10 times more expensive than mammography.

Rafferty had already been running trials of 3-D mammography for two years when the task force’s guidelines came out. She understood its concern about false positives – she was trying to address it, herself, albeit in a very different way. In fact, technology developers had been trying in various ways for years to increase mammography’s sensitivity (its ability to flag possible cases of cancer) while also increasing its specificity (its ability to filter out the false positives).

There’s an intuitive argument for why 3-D mammography might be more accurate. The technique works a little like a CT scan does; it takes 15 pictures of the breast at slightly different angles, then fuses them into a single synthesized image. If breast cancers were spherical in shape, they’d look basically the same in all 15 images, or, for that matter, on a conventional 2-D picture. But they’re very rarely shaped that way in reality. “In the breast, in particular, cancer cells tend to creep out single-file along the architecture of the body,” says Rafferty. “And that makes some of them especially hard to see on a [2-D] mammogram. They look like distortions, not blobs.” There’s another thing about cancer that is much clearer on a 3-D mammogram: spicules, or thin, spidery tentacles emerging from the center of a tumor. 2-D images, when taken from the wrong angle, are often too fuzzy to show them. In 3-D, however, the spicules are visible in high resolution – and seeing them is critical, since they are a hallmark of malignancy.

To Rafferty, the existing data are persuasive enough. “I own no stock in Hologic. I have no financial ties to them. And I was skeptical of this idea at first. You think to yourself, it is that simple? That elegant?” she says. “But this really does address the fundamental flaw of mammography. I want every woman to have access to this technology. I got my sisters down here when it was approved. I was like, ‘You’re all going to get this!’ Because in my heart I know it’s better.”

Andy Smith, Hologic’s vice president of imaging science, is similarly hopeful. “It’s expected to improve the cancer detection rate. It is going to reduce the recall rate,” he says, referring to suspicious findings that require women to return for follow-up tests, some of which turn out to be false alarms. “And we will have more numbers on that within one to two years.” This last part, at least, is very likely true. Mammography is heavily regulated, and clinics are required to send their recall statistics – the number of women they call back for second looks – to the federal government. The data on whether 3-D will save more lives than 2-D may not be known immediately. But they will exist.

However, the most meaningful data – the numbers that would show whether 3-D mammography saves women’s lives – won’t be available for decades. Only a prospective, randomized trial with mortality as its “endpoint” can say for sure, and that’s how long it takes to conduct one. Smith knows that that’s the reality. “We are expecting a reduction in morbidity and mortality, but we won’t know that for a long time,” he says. “You know, this technology has only been approved for two months.”

By the time such data do come out, mammography will surely have changed again. There are already efforts to augment it with contrast dyes, to develop a complementary tool called a “gamma camera,” and to augment imperfect human judgment by refining computer programs that can spot tumors as well as a radiologist might.

What this means is that the next time the US Preventive Services Task Force or anyone else wants to take a hard look at mammography, the data it has will once again be outdated. It’s inevitable. Three-D mammography may very well be more accurate than 2-D. It may see more cancers and fewer impostors. But whether it’s truly a “huge breakthrough” by the metric that matters most is a question that can’t currently be answered – and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be. Rafferty may know “in her heart” that 3-D is better. But right now, at least, that’s the only way she truly can.

"Researchers say a new drug targeting a specific gene in people with advanced breast cancer has shown hopeful results since being put under the microscope at Scottsdale Healthcare's Virginia G. Piper Cancer Center.

In an early Phase 1 study of the drug, focusing on the gene P13K, which is abnormal in 20 to 30 percent of advanced breast cancer patients, two of 97 individuals initially tested experienced significant shrinkage of tumors, according to hospital officials.

The cancer-related gene, if abnormal, could spur bodily signals that lead to cancer's growth. GDC-0941 was the drug under investigation.

""If a patient has a tumor in the lungs, then it's causing their difficulty breathing. If the tumor is pushing up against other organs, it could be causing pain,"" said Dr. Glen Weiss, director of thoracic oncology at Scottsdale Healthcare. ""Shrinking that (tumor) could relieve that system.""

The study at Virginia G. Piper, a clinical-trial partnership between Scottsdale Healthcare and the Translational Genomics Research Institute, was in collaboration with the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston and the Karmanos Cancer Institute in Detroit.

The 97 patients tested had various forms of advanced cancer. Of the two to show results, one had cervical cancer and the other breast cancer.

Phase 1 was key to determining effective dosages in the right patient, said Weiss, a physician-scientist with joint appointments also at TGen. The next step would be Phase 2, during which patients with the same cancer are given the same dose.

Breast cancer research advocates say for them, the best results are those that increase survival.

Sixteen years ago, Paradise Valley resident Karen Lewkowitz was diagnosed with breast cancer and, for the past 10 years, has been advocacy chairwoman for Bosom Buddies of Arizona, a group comprising those personally affected by the cancer.

""A lot of these things will shrink a tumor,"" she said of drug research. ""But what we look at as advocates is overall survival.""

Of breast cancer research, she said ""that's just not good enough"" until survival rates take a more dramatic turn for the better.

Patients in the study experienced diarrhea, nausea, rash, fatigue decreased appetite, vomiting, itchiness and taste alteration. Weiss said such side effects tend to be seen as an effect with this kind of oral drug.",1

TUESDAY, Aug. 2, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- There's still no cure for the common cold, but there may be a way to shorten its misery: A new study suggests that higher doses of zinc lozenges in certain formulations may cut the length of colds by more than 40 percent.

Researcher Dr. Harri Hemila, of the University of Helsinki in Finland, reviewed 13 placebo-controlled trials examining the effect of zinc lozenges on cold infections. Three of them found that zinc acetate in daily doses of more than 75 milligrams (mg) shortened colds' duration by 42 percent, on average.

Five trials using zinc salts other than acetate in daily doses greater than 75 mg shortened colds by an average of 20 percent, while another five using less than 75 mg per day produced no effect.

""Much of the variation in the published study findings can be explained by the daily dose of zinc administered in the zinc lozenges,"" said Hemila, who funded the research himself. ""When focusing on those studies which have used large daily doses of zinc, there is strong evidence that zinc lozenges shorten the duration of colds.""

The study is published in The Open Respiratory Medicine Journal.

Despite the popularity of zinc supplements, controversy over their effectiveness has continued since a much-publicized 1984 study first suggested a cold-limiting effect. Allowing the lozenge to dissolve instead of swallowing it seemed to provide a therapeutic effect. Since then, more than a dozen studies have been carried out, but data on the trace mineral's effectiveness has been mixed.

All of the trials examined by Hemila compared zinc lozenges to placebos. While surprised to note how strong the correlation was between daily doses of zinc and its effect on colds' duration, he said he and his colleagues still don't know why it seems to work.

""In the evidence-based medicine framework, we are primarily interested in the question whether there is an effect, and how great, whereas the mechanism of the effect is a secondary issue,"" he said.

No prior studies showed zinc lozenge use -- even up to 150 mg per day -- might cause harm aside from bad taste or constipation, Hemila said, and the most recent trial on zinc acetate indicated no significant differences between zinc and placebo groups in adverse effects even though the daily zinc dose was 92 mg.

Dr. Lisa Winston, an epidemiologist at San Francisco General Hospital, praised the study as a ""pretty good synthesis of the data,"" although she noted that the trials Hemila reviewed involved small numbers of participants.

""It's an area of controversy and question . . . but I don't think the evidence is strong enough, nor do I think the author is suggesting, that we can base clinical practice on it,"" said Winston, also an associate professor in the University of California-San Francisco Department of Medicine. ""I would tell my patients we still don't have a cure [for the common cold], and we don't know if zinc works.""

MONDAY, Aug. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- When women take a supplement of the omega 3 fatty acid DHA during pregnancy, their babies have fewer cold symptoms and shorter illnesses, new research indicates.

At 1 month and 3 months of age, about 38 percent of babies exposed to docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) in the womb experienced cold symptoms, compared to about 45 percent of the babies whose mothers were given a placebo supplement while they were pregnant.

""The data suggested that for most of the symptoms we looked at, duration of symptoms was less when mothers received DHA. And, in the case of colds, the probability of a cold was slightly less. The effects seemed to be strongest early on after birth,"" said study senior author Usha Ramakrishnan, an associate professor in the Hubert Department of Global Health at the Rollins School of Public Health at Emory University in Atlanta.

Ramakrishnan said it's probably too soon to recommend routine use of DHA supplements for pregnant women, because the findings weren't ""dramatic."" But, she added that the supplements did appear to be safe for pregnant women to take.

Results of the study will be published online on Aug. 1, and are scheduled to appear in the September issue of Pediatrics. The research was funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Health and the March of Dimes Foundation.

Omega 3 fatty acids are a class of nutrients considered essential for neural and retinal development during pregnancy. They are often obtained through diet by eating fish. But, concerns about mercury contamination in fish have led to recommendations that advise pregnant women to limit their fish consumption. Pregnant women are also advised to avoid certain fish, such as swordfish, altogether.

Therefore, the current study looked at DHA supplements derived from algae. Ramakrishnan said there are no concerns about mercury contamination in DHA from algae.

More than 800 Mexican women were included in the study. Half were randomly selected to be in the treatment group while the other half received a daily placebo pill. The treatment group received 400 milligrams of DHA each day, beginning when they were between 18 and 22 weeks pregnant. Treatment continued at least until the birth of the baby.

Ramakrishnan said Mexican women tend to be deficient in DHA, much like many American women are.

The babies were assessed at 1, 3 and 6 months of age, and the mothers completed questionnaires about their babies' health. To aid their recall, the mothers were also asked to keep a diary, recording any illness symptoms.

Babies in the DHA group had a 24 percent drop in the odds of having a combination of cold symptoms at 1 month compared to babies whose mothers were given a placebo. Also at 1 month, babies whose mothers had gotten the DHA supplement had 26 percent shorter duration of cough, 15 percent less time with phlegm and 30 percent shorter duration of wheezing.

At 3 months, babies in the DHA group were also sick 14 percent less time. And, at 6 months, the babies whose mothers had DHA had shorter duration of fever, runny nose and breathing problems.

At times, however, babies in the DHA group experienced longer duration of rashes and vomiting, the study authors noted.

Ramakrishnan said that it's likely that DHA boosts infants' immune response.

Dr. Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""We've been recommending DHA intake in pregnant women for brain and nervous system development, and this study suggests another good reason to take DHA.""

Wu recommended that women who are thinking about becoming pregnant should ""start prenatal vitamins and DHA supplements about three months before pregnancy and then continue them throughout the pregnancy. If you're not taking them ahead of time, you may miss out on proper nutrition,"" she added.

"New Device Reduces Seizures, No Surgery Required

Medications can cause mood problems, fatigue, or problems with thinking for some people. I see this as an alternative because it doesn't cause those side effects.

A experimental device that delivers electrical pulses to the forehead can help control epileptic seizures, say scientists at the University of California, Los Angeles.

The device works by stimulating the trigeminal nerve, which runs just beneath the skin covering the eyebrows. Electrical signals follow that nerve to areas in the brain where seizures often begin, researchers say.

The approach, which is not yet approved by the FDA, could offer an alternative or enhancement to treatment with drugs, says Christopher DeGiorgio, the neurologist at UCLA who invented the new approach.

""Medications can cause mood problems, fatigue or problems with thinking for some people,"" DeGiorgio says. ""I see this as an alternative because it doesn't cause those side effects.""

About 3 million Americans have epilepsy, and for about one-third of them, drugs alone do not control their seizures. A study of 50 people with drug-resistant epilepsy found that the trigeminal nerve stimulator was able to greatly reduce seizures for about 40 percent of them.

""For me it's extremely effective,"" says Jennifer Rees, 49, who lives in the Los Angeles area and has been using the nerve stimulator for six years.

Rees says that before using the stimulator, she was having up to eight seizures a month. The device alone reduced that to about one seizure a year. And she hasn't had any seizures since she added low doses of a medication more than 18 months ago.

The device is appealing because it doesn't require surgery, doesn't have side effects and is very easy to use, Rees says. She wears her device while she sleeps.

""For me, all it involved was putting two gel pads above my eyebrows, one on each eyebrow,"" she says. The device causes ""a slight tingling sensation"" on her skin, she says.

Researchers believe electrical pulses can act like a sort of pacemaker in the brain, heading off the chaotic ""electrical storms"" that cause epileptic seizures. And the trigeminal nerve stimulator is not the first time researchers have used electrical pulses to prevent seizures.

In 2005, the FDA approved a device that stimulates another nerve that leads to the brain — the vagus nerve. But stimulating the vagus nerve requires surgery to implant a device near the collarbone.

The trigeminal nerve stimulator, in contrast, never penetrates the skin and is powered by an external device about the size of a large cell phone, DeGiorgio says.

And DeGiorgio says he's found an interesting benefit to trigeminal nerve stimulation. It tends to relieve depression, which is common among people with epilepsy.",1

"Early menopause is often a side effect for women treated with chemotherapy for breast cancer, but a new study reveals some guarded promise for preventing early menopause breast cancer patients. The results are published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

While most breast cancer is diagnosed at later ages, about 6% of women learn that they're ill before age 40 - when they are still of childbearing age. Breast cancer treatments that have shown the best results for for disease free survival include chemotherapy, hormonal therapy, or both. For younger women still hoping for children, these treatments can cause devastating short-term or long-term loss of menstrual periods, and loss of fertility. While many women choose to preserve the option of having children by storing eggs before cancer treatment, the process can be costly and difficult.

Italian researchers conducted a phase three study that included 281 women with breast cancer, aged 18 to 45 years and who had not experienced menopause. Patients were randomly selected to be treated with chemotherapy alone or with chemotherapy and triptorelin, a drug, called a GnRH analogue, that prevents the ovaries from releasing eggs. The researchers followed the women for one year after they had finished chemotherapy.

Among the women who had not received triptorelin, the rate of early menopause was 25.9%. Among the women who had received triptorelin, the rate of early menoapuse was 8.9%, which is 17% lower.

An accompanying editorial by Dr. Hope S. Rugo and Dr. Mitchell P. Rosen of the University of California-San Francisco says that trptorelin therapy should not be recommended as a standard treatment and should be approached with caution in women with hormone-sensitive disease. They also stress that women resuming their menstrual cycles does not mean the same thing as women preserving their fertility. They conclude that using assisted reproductive technology – such as storing eggs before chemo, is “the most effective option for fertility preservation.”",1
"Heterosexuals who are HIV negative can significantly reduce their risk of infection by taking a daily dose of an antiviral drug, according to a new study by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.

The study, called TDF2, followed 1,200 uninfected heterosexual men and women between the ages of 18 and 39 years in Botswana, Africa.

Study participants took a tablet containing tenofovir disoproxil fumarate and emitricitabine (TDF/FTC), whose brand name is Truvada, or a placebo. On average, patients were followed for a year although some were followed for about three and a half years. The risk of infection was reduced 63% overall, but for participants who actually got the drugs, that risk decreased by 78%.

Giving daily antiretroviral drugs to uninfected individuals to prevent the disease is called pre-exposure prophylaxis or PrEP. Previous studies have shown PrEP to be effective in reducing infection rates among the uninfected.

Dr. Kevin Fenton, director of the CDC's national Center for HIV/AIDS, Viral Hepatitis, STD, and TB Prevention, called the news a milestone. ""It is clear we are not going to find one magic pill to solve the issue of HIV but by combining this approach with others we are beginning to get a better handle on combination packages. There is reason to be excited.""

The news comes at the same time a second study looking at PrEP in heterosexual couples in Kenya and Uganda also found significant reductions in infection rates. The Partners PrEP study participants took either TDF/FTC, the drug tenofovir–brand name Viread, or a placebo. Preliminary results showed both treatments significantly reduced transmission in couples where one partner was already infected with the virus. Patients who took tenofovir had 62% fewer infections while those taking the combination drug had 73% fewer infections than those who got the placebo.

""Just a few years ago the tool kit for HIV prevention was not very large,"" says Dr. Jared Baeten, the principal investigator of the Partners PrEP study at the University of Washington. ""Now we have a nice collection of really powerful strategies that work for the population at greatest risk in the world. This is really a game changer.""

""We now have findings from two studies showing that PrEP can work for heterosexuals, the population hardest hit by HIV worldwide,"" Fenton said. ""Taken together, these studies provide strong evidence the power of this prevention strategy.""

In fact, an interim review of the Partners data on effectiveness was so compelling that the trial was stopped early and the placebo arm was discontinued. Clear evidence Baeten said, that PrEP substantially reduces infection risk. At the same time he says, there was no evidence of safety concerns. Patients taking the placebo will be put on one of the drugs.

In the TDF2 study those taking the drug reported nausea, vomiting and dizziness.

An earlier PrEP trial, the iPrEx study, looked at treatment in men who have sex with men. Infection rates dropped by 90% in patients who consistently used PrEP.

“We are in a critical moment in HIV prevention research,” said Robert Grant, M.D., M.P.H, of the Gladstone Institutes and the University of California at San Francisco. He is the iPrEx protocol chair. “iPrEx provided the first proof of an important new method of HIV prevention that can help slow the global toll of 2.6 million new HIV infections each year. Partners PrEP and the TDF2 study have now expanded that finding by demonstrating the effectiveness of PrEP in heterosexual women and men.

""Developing and deploying proven HIV prevention methods – including PrEP, microbicides, vaginal gels, clean needles, medical male circumcision, early treatment, counseling, testing, condoms and suppressive therapy for pregnant women will all be key to slowing the global epidemic,"" he said.

The CDC says the next step is to fully review all the data and begin to develop guidelines for the use of these drugs in heterosexual men and women here in the U.S.",1
"Silicone Breast Implants: Safe, With Caveats

Enlarge this image toggle caption DONNA MCWILLIAM/AP DONNA MCWILLIAM/AP

Silicone breast implants were pulled off the market in 1992 amid concerns that leaks from the implants could lead to cancer or autoimmune disease.

Five years ago, revamped products returned to the market. But now the Food and Drug Administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed.

An FDA report, released in late June, says silicone implants are generally safe. But complications from implants are frequent — things like hardening of the skin around the implant; ruptured, wrinkled, or lopsided implants; scarring, pain and infection.

As many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade.

It also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants, the more likely she is to experience these complications.

Ruptured Implants Can Require Surgery

Take Kate Marion. She had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late 20s. Just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual.

""When I was crossing my left arm across my body — for instance, to put lotion on my right arm — I would make a little noise from my armpit, the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down,"" Marion says. ""A little tooty noise.""

An MRI showed both her implants had burst. Her doctor immediately recommended removing them, which she did. Marion hasn't suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants, and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn't have them replaced when she had the old ones removed. But ultimately she decided she didn't want to go through more surgery.

There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems...occur.

""Well, how long would these next ones last? I would be in my 60s when I had to do this again, and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are 60 something?"" says Marion.

Although the long-term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain, many plastic surgeons don't see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern.

""The actual silicone that's within the implants is inert. So if the silicone gel leaks, it doesn't travel through the body, it doesn't cause systemic problems. So the MRI is really detecting a cosmetic concern,"" says New York City plastic surgeon Matthew Schulman.

Oily Silicone Versus Gel

But there have been more serious outcomes. Annette Knecht got silicone implants in 1991 following a double mastectomy. For years afterward she felt ill, suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia, had trouble breathing and pain in her chest. Doctors reassured her it wasn't her implants.

""We had a CT scan done, and it showed OK — everything looked fine, so we didn't worry about it,"" says Knecht.

But no one ever told her to get an MRI — something the FDA now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years. As it turned out, Knecht's implants had leaked; a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs. She is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant — all, she says, for vanity.

""We're about four generations removed from those implants,"" says Schulman, the plastic surgeon. He explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early 1990s, when Knecht received hers. Back then they contained a runny liquid silicone.

""The silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel — it's essentially like a jelly. So the jelly may ooze a little bit, but it will not run out like an oil,"" says Schulman.

Sid Wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group Public Citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the FDA report sample just a fraction of the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Moreover, that data are limited to just the last two or three years — not enough, Wolf says, to make any real claims about the long-term safety of the implants.

""There is a huge deficiency of long-term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in, the more problems ... occur,"" says Wolf.

Thousands Still Choosing Silicone

Still, there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly 400,000 women who receive breast implants each year. Not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly 40 percent in the last decade, Schulman says that in his practice, 80 percent of them are choosing silicone over saline. What's more, he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine MRIs to screen for leaks.

Schulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline — though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon. Still, he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks — and additional surgeries are a very real possibility.

""Your young breast implants don't last forever,"" says Schulman. ""They may leak, they may rupture, you may decide you want a different size. So you have to at least expect that sometime in your life, you are going to need a reoperation. And if you are 100 percent against having another surgery related to these implants, then it's something you should reconsider.""",1

MONDAY, July 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Teens who have high levels of folic acid appear to do better in school than those with lower levels, Swedish researchers report.

""Folate intake had a positive association with academic achievement"" in the students studied, the authors wrote in the report published in the July 11 online edition and the August print issue of Pediatrics.

Not only should health providers monitor folic acid levels in teens, but the findings should influence school meals, school teaching and information given to parents, according to the researchers.

Teens often have high levels of the blood protein homocysteine, an amino acid linked to heart disease, and low levels of folic acid. In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said.

""We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,"" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine.

""We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,"" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added.

Armstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. ""It's one of those things that's no harm, no foul. It's not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,"" he said.

To find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics.

The investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted.

""These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. They may also have direct implications for school meal provisions, school teaching programs and information to parents,"" the authors concluded.

However, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted. ""It's too early to say that everyone should start taking folate,"" he stressed.

Folic acid is one of the B vitamins and is a key component in making DNA and RNA. Insufficient folic acid is a cause of certain birth defects of the spine and brain, including spina bifida.

Among the elderly, folic acid consumption appears to affect mental ability, and low levels of this vitamin have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to several studies.

Folic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, peas and nuts. In addition, people can obtain folic acid from breads, cereals and other grain products enriched with folic acid, as well as folic acid supplements.

New laser treatment takes aim at toenail fungus

By Rachel Saslow,

For people with toenail fungus, there is no good time to wear sandals. Not even at the beach in July.

Toenail fungus causes nails to become thick, yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful. Sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs, topical treatments and home remedies, sometimes to no avail. It tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks.

“The problem is huge. It is bigger than you can imagine,” says Washington podiatrist Stephen J. Kominsky. “I would say 70 percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails.”

There may be hope. Podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection — or wastes their patients’ money because it doesn’t work, depending on whom you ask.

The treatment, in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient’s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus, costs about $1,000 and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure. The nails aren’t immediately clear after the treatment, which takes up to an hour; the patient must wait for the fungus-free nails to grow out.

Last year, the Food and Drug Administration cleared the first laser, PinPointe, for “temporary increase of clear nail” in patients with onychomycosis, the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail. The FDA cleared a second one, GenesisPlus, in April. Practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about 2009.

‘No side effects’

Kominsky has treated 400 to 500 patients with the PinPointe laser. Compared with oral medication, he says, “the odds of success are better with the laser; plus, there’s no side effects.”

The most common oral treatment, Lamisil, works for about two out of three patients, according to Lamisil’s FDA-approved prescribing information, but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems. Other potential side effects include diarrhea, headache, rashes and changes in taste. According to Lamisil’s manufacturer, Novartis, the relapse rate is 15 percent one year after completing treatment.

In one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus, which appeared last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association, “26 eligible toes (ten mild, seven moderate, and nine severe)” were treated with a laser produced by Nomir Medical Technologies, which is still seeking FDA approval. After six months, 85 percent of the toenails had improved.

“I never use the term ‘cured’ with toenail fungus,” Kominsky says. “With a cure, people think there’s no chance for a recurrence. In this case, there is a chance.”

Even John Strisower, the founder of PinPointe USA, says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment.

Routes of infection

Research done by PinPointe, which is based in Chico, Calif., identified more than 100 organisms, including fungi, yeast, mold and bacteria, that work together to cause toenail fungus.

There’s no one route of infection, but sources include pedicures and locker room showers. Fungi love moist, dark environments such as wet shoes, Kominsky says, so people such as lifeguards, landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible. Shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus, which can also occur.

The elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can’t always fight it off, according to Washington podiatrist Lee Firestone. He estimates that about half of people over 70 have toenail fungus.

Last year, Americans spent $354 million on prescription and over-the-counter treatments for toenail fungus, according to IMS Health, a health-care information company.

Firestone typically recommends oral medication for patients with toenail fungus.

“I think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail, but it’s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement,” says Firestone, who doesn’t use the lasers in his practice. “I’ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long-term success.”

Vinegar won’t work

Firestone also says that over-the-counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can’t penetrate the nail root. Home remedies such as tea tree oil, bleach and vinegar also don’t work, he says.

Yet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many.

Richard, a retiree in Fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus, got a laser treatment on all 10 toes in April 2010, and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed, thickened look after a year. To prevent reinfection, he has purchased all new socks and a SteriShoe, a $130 device that uses ultraviolet light to sanitize shoes, at his podiatrist’s recommendation. He has also turned to what he calls “an old wives’ tale” that he read about in a newspaper column: slathering Vicks VapoRub on his toes.

"Got Low Back Pain? Massage Therapy May Rub It Out

Enlarge this image toggle caption /Group Health Research Institute /Group Health Research Institute

Low back pain is second only to cold symptoms when it comes to complaints that send people to the doctor. Sooner or later, back pain seems to get most of us.

Summary For Patients Read a summary of the findings and their implications from the Annals of Internal Medicine. A Comparison of Massage Therapy and Usual Medical Care for Chronic Low Back Pain

Now, a study in the July 5 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine shows that massage is an effective treatment for lower back pain. In some cases, researchers report, the benefits of massage lasted for six months or longer.

Researchers headed by epidemiologist Daniel Cherkin, a senior investigator at Group Health Research Institute in Seattle, enrolled 401 people with chronic low back pain and no identifiable reason for the pain.

Study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments. One group received full-body relaxation massage. A second received targeted deep tissue massage. The third group got the usual care — medication and physical therapy.

In relaxation massage, often referred to as Swedish massage, a variety of maneuvers are used to promote a feeling of relaxation throughout the body and muscles. Structural massage, commonly referred to as deep tissue massage, targets specific pain related tissues, ligaments and joints.

After 10 weeks, the results were dramatic: Nearly two-thirds of the patients who received either type of weekly massage said their back pain was significantly improved or gone altogether. Only about one-third of patients receiving the usual care experienced similar relief.

""We found that both types of massage were equally effective in helping people improve their function and diminish their symptoms,"" Cherkin says. He says massage relieved the pain for six months or more.

Prior studies of massage for back pain had tested only structural forms of massage, not relaxation massage. But relaxation massage is more widely available, and it's often less costly.

'I'm So Very Lucky'

Peggy O'Brien-Murphy was among the study participants. In her late 60s, a retired state employee, O'Brien Murphy tried just about everything to get rid of the pain in her lower back. The massage therapy finally seemed to do the trick.

""I'm so very lucky,"" she says.

Prior to the study, O'Brien-Murphy says she had found herself increasingly debilitated by back pain. At one point, she says she could hardly get out of a chair.

""It was really bad,"" she says. ""In fact, I was pulling myself up the stairs by the banister."" It was difficult getting into the car. And she could no longer walk the hills where she lives. For an active person, this was devastating.

So when she came upon an ad in her HMO's newsletter, Group Health Cooperative in Seattle, she jumped at the chance to take part in the massage study.

After just two or three sessions with massage therapist Loretta Lanz, O'Brien-Murphy said she felt better. After each session she walked around the block, standing straighter and walking further each time. By the end, she felt ""back to normal,"" with a ""spring to my walk and some energy in it!""

For O'Brien-Murphy, the massage-therapy experience has been life-changing: She has traveled to China, where she walked all over without problems, and she's already planning her next trips.

No one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain, says Dr. Richard Deyo of Oregon Health Sciences University, who also took part in the study.

""It may be that it helps with relaxation of muscles that are tense,"" Deyo says. ""But it may also be there are simply more generalized effects of relaxation — in the caring and attention and someone laying hands on — that may all be important.""

Researchers say future studies should look more closely at the benefits of massage and focus on cost-benefit analysis.

As for O'Brien-Murphy, she remains free of back pain, but not without some effort on her part. Other studies have shown that building strong and flexible muscles can help prevent back pain. O'Brien-Murphy never exercised before. But now she does weight training, muscle stretches and aerobic exercise — activities all shown to help prevent recurrence of lower back pain.",1

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The longest-running breast cancer screening study ever conducted has shown that regular mammograms prevent deaths from breast cancer, and the number of lives saved increases over time, an international research team said on Tuesday.

A doctor exams mammograms, a special type of X-ray of the breasts, which is used to detect tumours as part of a regular cancer prevention medical check-up at a clinic in Nice, south eastern France January 4, 2008. REUTERS/Eric Gaillard

The study of 130,000 women in two communities in Sweden showed 30 percent fewer women in the screening group died of breast cancer and that this effect persisted year after year.

Now, 29 years after the study began, the researchers found that the number of women saved from breast cancer goes up with each year of screening.

“We’ve found that the longer we look, the more lives are saved,” Professor Stephen Duffy of Queen Mary, University of London, whose study was published in the journal Radiology, said in a statement.

Dr. Stamatia Destounis, a radiologist at Elizabeth Wende Breast Care in Rochester, New York, who was not involved in the study, said radiologists have been quoting results of the Swedish study for years and the new findings show breast cancer screening is “even more of a benefit than we understood.”

She said sweeping changes in the U.S. screening guidelines two years ago that scaled back recommendations on breast cancer screening caused a lot of confusion among doctors and patients about the benefits of mammograms.

“We’ve had to do a lot of education of the patients and their doctors. This will help for that,” Destounis said.

In the study, women were divided into two groups, one that received an invitation to have breast cancer screening and another that received usual care.

The screening phase of the trial lasted about seven years. Women between 40 and 49 were screened every two years, and women 50 to 74 were screened roughly every three years.

“Our results indicate that in 1,000 women screened for 10 years, three breast cancer deaths would be prevented,” Duffy said, adding that most of the deaths prevented would have occurred more than a decade after the screening had started.

“This indicates that the long-term benefits of screening in terms of deaths prevented are more than double those often quoted for short-term follow-up.”

The new data adds to evidence on the long-term benefits of regular mammography screening.

SCREENING CONTROVERSY

New breast screening recommendations issued in 2009 by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, an influential advisory group, recommended against routine mammograms for women in their 40s and said women in their 50s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year.

The guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40, eliciting protests from breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation for fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer.

The changes were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps. But the latest results from the Swedish study show the rate of false positive results was low.

“We saw the actual number of overdiagnosed cases was really very small — less than 5 percent of the total,” Robert Smith, director of cancer screening at the American Cancer Society and one of the study’s authors, said in a telephone interview.

Many groups, including the American Cancer Society, have stuck by their long-standing recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age 40, stressing that the breast X-rays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early, when they are most easily treated.

“I think for anybody who was beginning to have their faith shaken in the value of mammography, these data show mammography is quite valuable as a public health approach to reducing deaths from breast cancer,” Smith said.

Duffy said he thinks screening women 40 to 54 every 18 months and screening women 55 and older every two years would be a reasonable schedule.

He said the new findings do not speak to the frequency of screening issue, but they do make clear that screening works.

“Everyone must make up their own mind, but certainly from combined results from all the screening trials, mammography in women aged 40-49 does reduce deaths from breast cancer,” he said.

Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, after lung cancer. It kills 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people around the world.",1

MONDAY, June 27, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Brilinta, an experimental anti-clotting medication currently awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, performed better than the industry standard, Plavix, when used in tandem with low-dose aspirin, a new study finds.

Heart patients who took Brilinta (ticagrelor) with low-dose aspirin (less than 300 milligrams) had fewer cardiovascular complications than those taking Plavix (clopidogrel) plus low-dose aspirin, researchers found.

However, patients who took Brilinta with higher doses of aspirin (more than 300 milligrams) had worse outcomes than those who took Plavix plus high-dose aspirin, the investigators reported.

Antiplatelet drugs are used to prevent potentially dangerous blood clots from forming in patients with acute coronary syndrome, including those who have had a heart attack.

Brilinta has already been approved for use in many other countries. In July 2010, an FDA panel voted 7-to-1 to approve the use of Brilinta for U.S. patients undergoing angioplasty or stenting to open blocked arteries, but the approval process is still ongoing.

The panel's recommendation was based in part on prior findings from this study, called the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial.

In this latest analysis of PLATO findings, researchers found that patients who took Brilinta with low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely than those who took Plavix with low-dose aspirin to have a heart attack or stroke, or to die within a year.

The findings were reported Monday in an American Heart Association online conference.

One expert said the new information is valuable.

""The study highlights that if one chooses to use ticagrelor in subjects with acute coronary syndromes, it would be logical to use aspirin 81 milligrams per day (and not 325 mg daily),"" said Dr. Jeffrey S. Berger, assistant professor of medicine and director of cardiovascular thrombosis at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. ""Of note, there is little reason to ever use aspirin 325 mg except in the acute setting of a heart attack or stroke,"" he added. ""A higher aspirin dose (325 mg versus 81 mg) increases the risk of bleeding without increasing the efficacy of the drug.""

A study author agreed that for most patients, using the drug with a lower dose of aspirin is usually warranted.

""Patients with acute coronary syndrome have options to prevent recurrent events,"" study lead author Dr. Kenneth W. Mahaffey, co-director of cardiovascular research at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, and associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, said in an AHA news release. ""Physicians choosing to use ticagrelor in countries where it is approved and available should consider using a low-dose of maintenance aspirin with the drug.""

The data and conclusions of the research should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"June 7, 2011 - People with well-controlled type 1 diabetes had even better sugar control, used less insulin, and lost an average of 10 pounds in six months when taking the type 2 diabetes drug Victoza in a small clinical study.

Those who continued treatment for a full year continued these improvements and felt much better overall, says study leader Paresh Dandona, MD, of the State University of New York, Buffalo.

""It is a dramatic change. They can see that their unexpected and unpredictable oscillations of blood sugar are minimized. They also lost weight,"" Dandona tells WebMD. ""Over a protracted period of time, as their diabetes continues to be well controlled, there is delightful improvement in patients' well-being.""

At the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in Boston, Dandona reported the results of a study in which 14 adults, whose type 1 diabetes was well controlled with insulin given via an insulin pump, received once-daily Victoza for either one week or 24 weeks.

Continuous glucose monitoring showed that their blood sugar was as tightly controlled as possible with insulin treatment. Yet all patients' blood sugar peaked and dipped at unpredictable intervals.

Adding Victoza to insulin therapy quickly eliminated these peaks and dips in blood sugar. After one week, average fasting and weekly blood sugar levels each dropped by about 15%.

And during Victoza treatment, patients needed less and less insulin. Their average dose of mealtime insulin decreased by seven units (30%) and their need for all-day insulin dropped by eight units (32%).

Patients who continued treatment for 24 weeks had further decreases in insulin doses, and lost an average of 10 pounds. This appeared to be due to reduced appetite and food intake. Hemoglobin A1c levels dropped from 6.5% to a normal level of 6.1%.

""Some patients have now been treated for up to a year, and the effect is as good as it was at the beginning,"" Dandona said at a news conference webcast from Boston.",1
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Exelixis Inc’s cabozantinib experimental drug shrank bone malignancies from prostate cancer in 76 percent of patients, interim results from a midstage trial show.

Of 108 patients so far evaluated by bone scan, 21 had complete resolution, and 61 had partial shrinkage of metastatic bone lesions, which can lead to bone fractures, severe pain and eventual death.

The disease remained stable in 23 other patients, or 21 percent, and worsened in three.

The study results were reported on Monday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology’s annual meeting.

“For the first time, cabo is showing dramatic activity against both soft tissue and metastatic bone lesions,” said Exelixis Chief Executive Officer Michael Morrissey. “Men with late-stage prostate cancer usually die from bone disease.”

After 12 weeks of treatment, 31 patients were randomly selected to receive either a placebo or cabozantinib. The drug reduced by 87 percent the risk of disease progression or death.

Excluding patients on placebo, the median survival without disease progression was 29 weeks.

Side effects of cabozantinib included fatigue, high blood pressure and hemorrhage.

Morrissey said Exelixis planned to start a Phase 3 prostate cancer trial in the second half of this year with a combined goal of reducing pain and bone malignancies.

Cabozantinib, also known as XL184, is an oral drug designed to limit blood supply to tumors and to block two segments of a pathway used by cancer cells to grow and spread.

Other Phase 2 data presented over the weekend showed that treatment with cabozantinib led to significant tumor shrinkage in 24 percent of patients with metastatic ovarian cancer.

But two ovarian cancer patients died from cabozantinib-related side effects - one from bowel fistula and one from intestinal perforation.

Exelixis expects to have initial results around midyear from a pivotal trial of the drug as a treatment for thyroid cancer.",1

"Autism spectrum disorders , marked by impaired language, repetitive behaviors, and social difficulties, now affect up to one in 110 children, according to the CDC.

The research needs to be duplicated, Hertz-Picciotto tells WebMD. Still, she says, the finding points to a gene-environment interaction that may possibly help explain some cases of autism.

Taking prenatal vitamins was found even more protective for mothers and children who had a high-risk genetic makeup .

""It appears that women who reported taking prenatal vitamins starting three months prior to conception and through the first month after conception seem to have a reduced chance their child will develop autism ,"" says study researcher Irva Hertz-Picciotto, PhD, professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the MIND Institute and Department of Public Health, University of California, Davis.

June 1, 2011 -- Taking prenatal vitamins may reduce the risk of having a child with autism , new research shows.

Prenatal Vitamins and Autism Risk

The researchers looked at three groups of children, all aged 2 to 5. All were enrolled in the CHARGE study (CHildhood Autism Risks from Genetics and Environment) from 2003 to 2009. The groups included:

288 children with autism

141 with autism spectrum disorder

278 children with typical development

Mothers reported their use of prenatal vitamins or other supplements before, during, and after pregnancy.

The researchers collected blood from all family members to evaluate their genetic makeup.

They focused on genes known to play a role in folate metabolism. These genes include MTHFR and COMT as well as others. Folate and other B vitamins are crucial to brain development.

Overall, Hertz-Picciotto says, ""For the women who didn't take prenatal vitamins, there was about a 60% higher risk of having a child with autism.""

The risk rose if the mothers or the children had a high-risk gene form.

The mothers with the high-risk form of MTHFR had a 4.5 times higher chance of a child developing autism, she says, than mothers without this high-risk form who did take the prenatal vitamins.

Children who had the high-risk COMT gene form were seven times as likely to have autism as children without it whose mothers did take the vitamins.

""Overall, it does look like there are at least a couple of genes here, either the mother's genotype or the child's genotype, that show this interaction ... magnifying the size of the effect from not taking the vitamins,"" Hertz-Picciotto says.

Exactly why the prenatal vitamins may protect against autism is not clear, she says. It may be that the vitamins contribute to high levels of folate.",1
"Egg Freezing Puts The Biological Clock On Hold

Enlarge this image toggle caption Marisa Penaloza/NPR Marisa Penaloza/NPR

This story is part of an occasional series.

As more women postpone motherhood into their 30s, even 40s, they're hitting that age-old constraint: the biological clock. Now, technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock, at least for a while.

In a Manhattan office building on a recent evening, two dozen women — all in their 30s and 40s — sit in folding chairs, balancing cellphones and glasses of wine. They're gathered for a seminar called ""Take Control of Your Fertility.""

Dr. Alan Copperman of Reproductive Medicine Associates of New York wastes no time laying out this harsh reality: By the time a woman hits her 40s, 90 percent of her eggs are abnormal. The chances of a typical 40-year-old getting pregnant in any given month? Ten percent. Unless, that is, she gets pregnant with her younger eggs — eggs she had frozen years before.

Copperman explains the procedure, introduces someone who has gone through it and takes a flurry of questions.

Afterward, women crowd a counter to set up appointments with Copperman's clinic, which offers egg freezing. Sally Montgomery is among the youngest here, and the most upbeat. Her mom had trouble conceiving, so she wants to be proactive.

""I'm 31, your typical New Yorker,"" she says. ""I'm single, I'm bouncing around, and I'd like the opportunity to have a family, so I just figured, 'Why not?' I don't think it's a guarantee, but it's a nice insurance policy, and I think it takes some of the pressure off.""

Others, though, slip out quietly. One 40-year-old says she wishes she'd learned about egg freezing earlier. Esther Montoro, a 37-year-old photographer, looks a little stunned.

""I think it's fantastic,"" she says, ""but I think it's so incredibly expensive.""

The whole process — a week of hormones, plus the procedure to collect the eggs — runs $12,000 to $14,000. And because it takes 10 to 20 eggs for a reasonable shot at success, some may need to do this several times. Plus, there are annual storage fees. Then, when you're ready to use your eggs, you'll need in vitro fertilization, another pricey procedure. All told, costs can easily exceed $40,000, money Montoro doesn't have.

""I guess there's a big assumption that most women that need to do this [are] career, successful, rich women,"" she says. ""And I'm not!""

Technological Advances

In his office later, Copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper. Still, he says, freezing eggs offers many women the biggest game changer since the birth control pill 50 years ago.

""Women began to have reproductive choices,"" he says. ""They got to decide when not to get pregnant. This technology has the potential to help women decide when they can get pregnant.""

Clinics in the U.S. have long frozen fertilized eggs, or embryos. But eggs alone are more delicate and prone to damage. Over the years, egg freezing has been offered mainly to cancer patients facing radiation, but success rates were pretty dismal. Of late, though, the technology has exploded thanks to scientific leaps, including a flash-freeze method called vitrification.

In Copperman's lab, you can hear the sizzle as a tiny tube is plunged into liquid nitrogen.

""Snap freeze, snap thaw,"" he says. ""And what's really impressive is that when it comes out, it comes out looking just like it went in.""

Ironically, much of this research was pioneered in Italy and Spain, where Catholic influence discouraged the creation of too many embryos, leaving fertility researchers with unused eggs instead.

With the better survival rate from vitrification and other new freezing methods, more and more clinics are now offering what they call ""fertility preservation."" Meanwhile, the early adopters are starting to come back and use their eggs.

First Wave Of Babies

In a New York high rise, 8-month-old Camden squeals in delight as she bounces in her walker. She's here thanks to eggs her mom froze several years ago.

""My best friend and I made a pact together that at age 38, if we were both still single, we were going to have a child on our own,"" says Robyn Ross.

When that time came, Ross decided she wasn't ready for single motherhood. Instead, she froze 14 eggs. Within a year, she fell in love and soon got married.

Her husband, Mark Cohen, says he wasn't at all put off by the fact that his new love had her eggs in the freezer. As it turned out, his sperm was weakened by earlier cancer treatment, so conceiving their baby in a lab was the perfect solution.

""And this is our miracle baby,"" Cohen says, planting a kiss on Camden. ""We are one little happy family.""

Ross has already evangelized to her younger sister.

""I made her promise me that if she's still single by the age of 32, she would freeze her eggs,"" she says. ""The younger the better.""

Now, before you run out to a fertility clinic, there is a big note of caution. The Society for Assisted Reproductive Technology, which sets industry guidelines, still considers egg freezing experimental.

""If the question were just, 'Does egg freezing and thawing work to achieve a pregnancy?' I think we're close,"" says Dr. Eric Widra, a member of the society's executive council.

But only 1,000 to 2,000 babies in the world have been born using frozen eggs. So far, they're fine — no abnormalities. Still, Widra would like a larger-scale, longer-term track record. It's not clear when — or if — a big-scale study might happen. But Widra says women need to understand that success rates will never be 100 percent.

""It's an insurance policy that you may or may not actually ever need,"" he says. ""And it's an insurance policy that if you do need, may not pay out.""

And yet, even Widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility. At Shady Grove Fertility, the Washington, D.C., clinic where he practices, he offers it to his own patients.

The Challenge Of Setting An Age Limit

It's quite a concept: Put your eggs in deep freeze and disconnect from that nagging biological clock. But, until when? How old is too old to use your younger eggs?

""There should be guidelines, I think, that are more clearly defined,"" says Dr. Geoffrey Sher, who heads the Sher Institutes for Reproductive Medicine and is based in Las Vegas.

He says many clinics suggest a cutoff of 50, the average age of menopause. After that, pregnancy can be riskier, and the large age gap raises complicated social issues. But the limit is tricky to impose. Sher remembers one couple who wanted to use donor eggs to conceive. The husband was 45, his wife, 55. Sher hesitated.

""And she said, 'That's discriminatory. If my husband was my age and I was his age, you wouldn't hesitate.' And she had a point,"" Sher says.

The woman was healthy. And the uterus doesn't decline like eggs do; in some cases, it can actually be coaxed back into working order. Sher's ethics board said OK.

""And she went ahead and had a baby at 57 years of age without any problems whatsoever,"" Sher says. ""I get a postcard from them at Christmas every year.""

The bigger challenge, Sher and others say, is reaching out to younger women — getting them to take action before it's too late. They envision a time when society considers freezing eggs an act not of desperation but of empowerment.

Pop a Tylenol and take a brisk walk for protection against prostate cancer? That’s what the findings of two new studies published this week suggest.

In the first study, published Monday in the journal Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers and Prevention, scientists found that men who took a daily dose of acetaminophen (Tylenol) for five years had a 38% lower risk of developing prostate cancer, compared with other men. Additionally, daily acetaminophen was associated with a 51% reduced risk of developing an aggressive form of the disease. Men who took acetaminophen for less than five years saw no protective benefit.

(More on TIME.com: Coffee Drinking Linked With Lower Risk of Fatal Prostate Cancer)

Previous research has shown that taking aspirin or other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) every day may help reduce prostate cancer risk. The authors theorize that the same may be true of acetaminophen; while not an NSAID, it does have anti-inflammatory properties.

For the study, the researchers looked at data from 78,485 men who participated in the longitudinal Cancer Prevention Study II Nutrition Cohort, answering questions about diet and drug use every two years starting in 1992. During the follow-up, there were 8,092 cases of prostate cancer — significantly fewer in the group who took acetaminophen daily for five years.

The second study, published online Tuesday by Cancer Research, involved 1,455 men who had already been diagnosed with early-stage prostate cancer. Researchers from the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), and Harvard School of Public Health followed the men from 2004 to 2009 and found that those who engaged in regular brisk walking after diagnosis were significantly less likely to see their disease progress.

(More on TIME.com: Study: Gay Men Are Twice as Likely to Have Cancer)

Men who walked briskly — at a pace of about 3 miles per hour or faster — at least three hours per week were 57% less likely to experience disease progression (including elevated PSA levels, secondary treatment, bone metastasis or prostate cancer-related death), compared with men who walked less and more slowly.

“The important point was the intensity of the activity,” Erin Richman, a postdoctoral fellow at UCSF, said in a statement. “The walking had to be brisk for men to experience a benefit.”

The researchers said the effect of brisk walking persisted independent of age, diagnosis, type of treatment and characteristics of disease. The patients’ average age at diagnosis was 65. The findings are in line with previous research suggesting that physical activity may help reduce the risk of disease-related death in certain cases of prostate cancer.

(More on TIME.com: Using Toenails to Predict Risk of Lung Cancer)

Why the association? MedPage Today reports:

Richman and colleagues noted that the brisk walks may reduce insulin resistance, which decreases bioavailable insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF1) and increases adiponectin levels, which are all associated with decreased risk of advanced or fatal prostate cancer in vitro and in vivo. Another potential source of the associated reduction was reduced inflammation due to a lower circulation of interleukin-6, high levels of which “predicted a 73% increased risk of dying from prostate cancer among normal-weight men,” the researchers wrote.

Prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in men. According to the National Cancer Institute, about 32,050 men died from prostate cancer in 2010 and 217,000 new cases were diagnosed. More than 2.2 million men in the U.S. are living with prostate cancer.",0
"May 23, 2011 -- Researchers in Europe say a fermented dairy product containing a specific bacterium known as a probiotic did not relieve constipation in children more than a dairy product without a probiotic.

The finding is significant, the researchers say, because probiotics have helped some adults with constipation.

It seemed logical that probiotics, live microorganisms that are often called “friendly” or “good” bacteria, might work for children. But in a new study the kids who consumed the fermented dairy product did no better, based on number of stools produced, than youngsters in a comparison group.

The study examined 159 children with constipation for at least two months with a defecation rate of less than three times per week. About half were given the probiotic product twice daily for three weeks; children in the comparison group were given a dairy product without the probiotic.",1

MONDAY, May 16, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Half of children with sleep apnea who also wet the bed might stop their bedwetting if their tonsils or adenoids are removed, new research suggests.

Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) is marked by interruptions in breathing while asleep; it is common among children with enlarged tonsils or adenoids. Exactly how sleep apnea results in bedwetting is not fully understood, but hormonal changes may play a role.

However, half of the 417 children in this latest study who had sleep apnea and were bedwetters stopped wetting the bed after they had their tonsils or adenoids removed. Children in the study were aged 5 to 18, and were followed for just under one year after their surgery, on average.

Those who did not stop wetting the bed after the surgery were more likely to be born prematurely, be male, be obese or have a family history of bedwetting, the investigators noted. Premature birth was the greatest predictor of continued bedwetting after surgery.

""If they haven't seen an ear, nose and throat specialist, see one to see if the child who wets the bed has OSA that can be cured by tonsil or adenoid removal,"" said study author Dr. Yegappan Lakshmanan, chief of pediatric urology at Children's Hospital of Michigan, in Detroit.

The findings were to be presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association (AUA), in Washington, D.C. Research presented at medical meetings should be viewed as preliminary until it has been published in a peer-reviewed medical journal.

There are many other causes of bedwetting, Lakshmanan said. ""About 5 to 7 million children are bedwetters, and the causes fall into three main groups: bladder issues, sleep-related problems and the kidneys,"" he explained. ""The children in this study wet the bed due to sleep-related problems.""

So why weren't they all cured? ""Bedwetting is multifactorial even within these groups, and eventually we should be able to pinpoint the cause for every single child,"" Lakshmanan said.

""There are several potential causes of bedwetting, and sleep apnea is clearly one of them,"" said Dr. Lane S. Palmer, chief of pediatric urology at the Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y.

""There are secondary positive effects of this tonsil- or adenoid-removing surgery, but I don't know that I would jump to have my child's tonsils or adenoids out as a primary treatment for bedwetting,"" he said. ""Children with sleep apnea and bedwetting should see an otolaryngologist first.""

""This study really underscores the fact that children who have other issues with sleep should be looked at for bedwetting because anything that depresses sleep at night can lead to bedwetting,"" said AUA spokesman Dr. Anthony Atala, a urologist at Wake Forest University in Winston-Salem, N.C.

""If a child has bedwetting, pay close attention to their sleep patterns, and observe them while they are asleep and you can see whether they are breathing at a regular pace, and if not, seek additional help,"" Atala said.

Children with sleep apnea can be difficult to rouse, which may cause the bedwetting, said Dr. Dennis Kitsko, an otolaryngologist at the Children's Hospital of Pittsburgh. ""But not every child with sleep apnea will wet the bed, and not every bedwetter will have sleep apnea.""

Still, ""snoring in children is abnormal,"" said Dr. Linda Dahl, an ear, nose and throat doctor at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Children snore because their tonsils and adenoids are enlarged, and they end up getting other behaviors that go along with sleep apnea, including bedwetting,"" she explained.

""There are many ancillary benefits that you may not attribute to removing large tonsil and adenoids, such as putting an end to bedwetting,"" Dahl added.

"Researchers comparing pancreatic cancer treatments found notable differences in patient survival rates and quality of life.

French investigators from a private company known as BioMed randomly selected 342 patients with pancreatic cancer. Part of the group was given gemcitabine, the most favored treatment according to oncologists. The other patients were given a combination of four chemotherapy drugs, (oxaliplatin, irinotecan, fluorouracil and leucovorin) known as FOLFIRINOX. The treatments lasted for six months. The purpose of the study was to record the overall survival rates of each group.

Researchers found that even though people on the FOLFIRINOX had a longer average survival rate of 11.1 months, versus the gemcitabine group with 6.8 months, the quality of life for patients on FOLFIRINOX was not as good. At least 5% of patients on the drug combination suffered from low white blood cell counts, fatigue, serious diarrhea, a loss of feeling in their feet and hands, as well as hair loss. After six months, only 31% of patients on FOLFIRINOX reported a decent quality of life, compared with 66% of those on gemcitabine.

Investigators concluded that although the FOLFIRINOX did improve survival rates over gemcitabine, the toxicity of the drug combination caused numerous negative side effects. Therefore investigators recommended that only patients who are younger than 76 years old, and who do not suffer from other health problems use FOLFIRINOX.

Pancreatic cancer is the fourth leading cause of death from cancer in the United States. For most patients, the prognosis is grim. Only about 6 percent of those with the diagnosis live longer than five years.

The study is published in this week’s issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. It was funded by the government of France.",0
"WEDNESDAY, May 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- It may be possible to assess a man's fertility by checking his ""anogenital distance,"" the gap between his scrotum and anus, a new study suggests.

Previous studies in animals have shown that anogenital distance is an important measure of genital development and may be shorter in males with abnormal development and dysfunction of the testicles, the Baylor College of Medicine researchers explained.

Furthermore, a study from the University of Rochester, published in March in Environmental Health Perspectives, found that men with shorter anogenital spans had lower sperm counts, poorer quality sperm, lower sperm concentrations and lower motility.

In the new study, the Baylor group investigated whether anogenital distance differed in fertile and infertile men. They measured the scrotum-anus distance as well as the penis length of 117 infertile and 56 fertile men visiting an andrology clinic.

The infertile men had a significantly shorter anogenital distance and penis length than the fertile men, the study found.

Dr. Michael Eisenberg, a male reproductive medicine and surgery fellow in the Baylor urology department and the study's lead author, said the study has two main implications. ""First, this could represent a noninvasive way to test testicular function and reproductive potential in adult men,"" he said in a Baylor news release. ""And second, it suggests that gestational exposures and development may impact adult testicular function.""

Further research is needed to compare techniques for measuring anogenital distance and assess their accuracy, he and his colleagues said.

One expert who's done her own research in this area applauded the study.

""This is an important paper showing, once again, that anogenital distance is a strong predictor of semen quality,"" said Shanna H. Swan, vice chair for research in the department of preventive medicine at Mount Sinai Children's Environmental Health Center, New York City.""This paper also provides new data on infertile men, who have shorter (less masculine) anogenital distance.""

Swan said that she and her colleagues published similar findings last month. ""Together the two studies make a strong case that this simple measure (the anogenital distance) reflects early genital development and predicts semen quality and fertility,"" she said.

But one urologist said the the finding is too preliminary to introduce into clinical practice, however.

""We would all like a simple, noninvasive way to predict potential problems with fertility in men, but unfortunately, this one is not ready for prime time,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urology specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""We have a long way to go before we can use anogenital distance as a determinant of future fertility in men.""

The study was published online May 11 in PLoS One.

"May 10, 2011 -- People who practice the meditative technique called mindfulness meditation may be able to reduce the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), a new study shows.

The study found that the physical and psychological symptoms of IBS were more effectively managed by people practicing mindfulness meditation than in support group therapy.

Susan Gaylord, PhD, of the University of North Carolina’s program on integrative medicine, set out to evaluate mindfulness meditation as a therapeutic technique for IBS because it has been reported to improve symptoms in other chronic conditions, such as depression and fibromyalgia.

In a study of 75 women between the ages of 19 and 71, participants were placed in a mindfulness meditation group or a comparison group that offered mutual support for IBS and life’s problems.

Each group took an eight-week course that included weekly sessions and a half-day retreat.

After the end of the eight-week period, overall IBS severity was reduced more among patients in the mindfulness meditation group compared to the support group: 26.4% vs. 6.2%.

After a three-month follow-up, 38.2% of those in mindfulness meditation reported a reduction in severity of IBS symptoms, compared with only 11.8% who said that among patients who took part in the support group therapy.",0
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - Johnson & Johnson’s Stelara helped a significantly higher percentage of Crohn’s disease sufferers than those who received a placebo, according to a study of patients who had not been helped by other commonly used drugs.

In addition, nearly 70 percent of patients who stayed on Stelara beyond the initial six weeks of the mid-stage study continued to respond to the drug and there was a significantly higher rate of remission at 22 weeks than in a placebo group.

Stelara, known chemically as ustekinumab, is already approved to treat the skin condition plaque psoriasis and is in late-stage testing for psoriatic arthritis. An approval for Crohn’s would give the drug entry into an estimated $1.3 billion U.S. market and $2.7 billion market worldwide.

The intravenous biotech drug met the primary goal of the study as almost 40 percent of patients who received the 6 milligrams per kilogram of weight dose of Stelara achieved a clinical response — defined as a 100-point reduction in the Crohn’s Disease Activity Index (CDAI) — after six weeks of treatment.

That compared with a response rate of 23.5 percent of patients who received a placebo.

Two lower doses of Stelara were also tested in the study of 526 patients with moderate to severe Crohn’s disease who were not helped by, or could not tolerate, treatment with a widely used class of drugs known as TNF antagonists, such as Abbott Laboratories’ Humira.

Those who received 1 mg/kg had a 36.6 percent response rate and the 3 mg/kg dose led to a 34.1 percent response rate.

“To see these kind of outcomes, where you have high response rates in the short term and then good remission rates out toward five or six months of therapy, it shows unequivocally that the drug is effective for treating Crohn’s disease,” said Dr. William Sandborn, the study’s lead investigator, who presented the data at the Digestive Disease Week meeting in Chicago on Sunday.

“It’s effective in the patient population that has the greatest unmet need at this point in time,” Sandborn said of patients who do not respond to anti-TNF drugs.

He said a 100-point drop in the CDAI was clinically meaningful to patients. “They’ll feel measurably better.”

“The patient population was really quite ill and had very high disease activity, and despite that we saw nice response rates,” Sandborn said.

In a second phase of the study, those who responded to Stelara after six weeks of treatment were given either a 90-mg injection of Stelara at week eight and week 16 or a placebo.

After 22 weeks, 69.4 percent of the Stelara patients maintained a clinical response and 41.7 percent were deemed to be in clinical remission. That compared with 42.5 percent who maintained a clinical response and a 27.4 percent remission rate in the placebo group.

Clinical remission was defined as a CDAI score down to 150. Patients in the study on average started at 320 or 325 on the CDAI scale, researchers said.

Crohn’s is a chronic autoimmune disorder of the gastrointestinal tract that affects an estimated 700,000 Americans. Common symptoms are abdominal pain and diarrhea, and it can lead to bowel perforations. Many Crohn’s patients require surgery when medicines no longer control symptoms.

The rate of infections and other serious side effects was similar in the Stelara and placebo groups, researchers said.

“We’ll need more patients and longer-term data to really fully characterize the safety profile in Crohn’s disease, but so far so good,” Sandborn said.",1
"April 27, 2011 -- Gastric bypass weight loss surgery often improves type 2 diabetes long before patients lose much weight. Now a new study from Duke University Medical Center and Columbia University may help explain why.

When researchers compared patients who had gastric bypass surgery to those who lost the same amount of weight by dieting, they found that the surgery patients had lower levels of amino acids that have been linked to insulin resistance.

The study was small, including just 10 patients who had the surgery and 11 patients who followed severely calorie-restricted diets. And the patients in both groups had lost just a fraction of the weight they needed to lose at the time of the analysis.

But researchers say the preliminary findings could one day lead to diabetes treatments.

“Certainly weight loss by any means improves type 2 diabetes, but there is something else going on with gastric bypass surgery,” study researcher Blandine Laferrere, MD, of Columbia University’s St. Luke’s and Roosevelt Hospital Center, tells WebMD.

“Surgery puts the diabetes into remission. Most of the research has focused on changes in gut hormones, but we have shown that a decline in specific circulating amino acids also occurs.”",1
"Tai Chi, A 'Medication In Motion,' Helps People With Heart Failure

Enlarge this image toggle caption Robert F. Bukaty/AP Robert F. Bukaty/AP

Visit an urban park in China any given morning or late afternoon, and you're likely to find elderly people engaged in a slow, elegant dance, their arms and legs lifting and circling in unison. Tinny traditional music might be playing from a battery-run cassette player. The seniors are focused and at ease in their daily ritual, and it's soothing to watch them.

The movement is tai chi, an ancient martial art turned exercise, and a study out this week in Archives of Internal Medicine says it may help people suffering from heart failure feel better about life. In a quality of life questionnaire the researchers gave out, those who practiced tai chi scored significantly higher than those who hadn't been doing the movement. The tai chi group also reported an improvement in mood.

Heart failure is a tough disease to live with; the shortness of breath and low energy that can come because the heart can't pump enough blood make physical activity unappealing. ""Historically, patients with chronic systolic heart failure were considered too frail to exercise and, through the late 1980s, avoidance of physical activity was a standard recommendation,"" the study's authors write.

The Chinese developed tai chi thousands of years ago, but it has recently piqued the interest of Western medicine as an alternative mind-body therapy to treat disease. According to a Harvard Medical School newsletter, tai chi is increasingly seen as a form of 'medication in motion.'

It's been shown to be useful in treating a wide range of diseases from breast cancer to Parkinson's. The National Institutes of Health has also jumped on board and is funding a variety of studies on tai chi for chronic disease.

The Archives of Internal Medicine study is the first large clinical trial to look at whether a tai chi program can do anything for people with heart failure. The researchers recruited 100 people with the chronic condition from heart clinics in Boston. About half were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week tai chi exercise program. The other half got a heart health education program.

The tai chi program started off with some traditional warm-up exercises of arm swinging, gentle stretches, breathing, and visualization techniques. Then patients learned five simple movements designed to release tension in the body, increase awareness of breathing, and relax the body and mind. Patients got an instructional video tape, and were encouraged to practice at home at least 3 times a week.

The study authors say there's a usually a strong relationship between depression and heart failure, so the fact that tai chi helped cheer people up was an especially good sign.",1

MONDAY, April 25, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture might help reduce the hot flashes that frequently affect prostate cancer patients while they're on hormone therapy, a small study suggests.

The findings don't confirm that the ancient Chinese discipline relieves hot flashes, and only 14 men participated in the study, which was conducted by researchers at New York Methodist Hospital and Weill Cornell Medical College of Cornell University.

Still, ""our study shows that physicians and patients have an additional treatment for something that affects many men undergoing prostate cancer treatment and actually has long-term benefits, as opposed to more side effects,"" said lead author Dr. Hani Ashamalla, a radiation oncologist at New York Methodist Hospital, in a news release from the American Society for Radiation Oncology.

Acupuncture, a popular form of alternative medicine, involves inserting ultra-thin needles into the skin.

""We are now designing a randomized clinical trial to further evaluate acupuncture after prostate cancer treatment,"" Ashamalla added.

Hormone therapy designed to reduce levels of testosterone in the body is one of the standard treatments for prostate cancer. However, about half of patients who undergo hormone therapy suffer from hot flashes similar to those that women experience during menopause.

""It is a definite nuisance. I've seen reports that upwards of 60 percent of men will get hot flashes,"" said Dr. Stephen Freedland, an associate professor of urology and pathology at Duke University, in an interview. ""Usually it's mild and self-limiting and improves with time. But there are some men who really have it bad.""

In the study, researchers followed 14 men who were taking hormone therapy for prostate cancer and suffered from hot flashes.

They received acupuncture twice a week for 30 minutes over four weeks. Their reported level of hot flashes dropped markedly.

The question is whether the acupuncture reduced the hot flashes or a placebo effect played a role, said Freedland, who's familiar with the study findings.

It's also possible, he said, that the symptoms went away on their own, which commonly happens to men on hormone therapy.

However, ""clearly these men described getting better, and it happened over a very short period of time,"" he said. ""The symptoms don't (normally) get better by that much that quickly.""

The study, published in the April issue of the International Journal of Radiation Oncology, Biology, Physics, also found that acupuncture relieved the heart palpitations and anxiety often associated with hormone therapy for prostate cancer.

THURSDAY, April 21, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- For men who believe size matters -- and that their penises don't measure up -- success can be found in certain non-surgical penile lengthening treatments, a new study analysis by Italian researchers contends.

Concerned that patients were seeking out unproven and potentially dangerous ways of lengthening the penis, the researchers examined the medical literature to see whether popular non-surgical methods had any scientific basis.

In a review of five evidence-based surgical studies of 121 men and six non-surgical studies of 109 men published between 2000 and 2009, the researchers found that penile extenders -- which stretch the organ over a period of months through traction -- were the most effective among non-invasive methods.

But one expert cautioned that men are playing with fire if they tinker with their penis size simply for vanity's sake. Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said functional issues resulting from conditions such as birth defects or prostate cancer surgery may warrant penile surgery, but such cases are unusual.

""It's a very fragile organ to begin with,"" Kavaler said, ""and if you start to do all these things to it you can disfigure it... They should leave it alone.""

Study co-author Dr. Paolo Gontero said urologists are constantly approached by men concerned about their penis size, despite the fact that the majority are average, with a flaccid length of 1 to 4 inches.

""However, most men complaining of inadequate penile size do have associated sexual problems even if their penile dimensions fall within the normal range -- so-called dysmorphophobic penis,"" said Gontero, an associate professor of urology at the University of Turin. ""No study has, however, specifically addressed the extent and type of sexual bother in this patient category.""

Dysmorphophobia ""is a condition consisting of an imaginary flaw in the physical appearance,"" the study noted.

Writing in the April issue of the British Journal of Urology International, Gontero and his colleagues found that penile extenders work better than techniques such as vacuum devices, exercises and Botox injections, and that psychological satisfaction is equally as important as any physical changes.

A review of surgical techniques showed they increased phallus size an average of about a half-inch to 1 inch, but Gontero cautioned that the safest surgery -- which cuts the suspensory ligament of the penis to lengthen it -- often yields poor results.

""On the contrary, more complex lengthening procedures are to be considered experimental and potentially dangerous,"" he said.

""All procedures aimed to increase the penile girth should be considered unsafe, leading to potentially poor cosmetic and functional results,"" Gontero added. ""I have come across such cases that I had to re-operate in order to remove additive substances injected around the penis.""

The men studied ranged in age from 24 to 56 and were followed between three and 16 months.

More than 70 of them used penile extenders, with six experiencing minor problems such as bruising, pain and itching. These devices yielded average flaccid length increases of between 0.2 inches and 1 inch, Gontero said, and men achieving better results noted their satisfaction.

""Application of progressive and constant traction forces is a very old-fashioned technique used by the ancestors and currently by some tribal populations to elongate the penis or the neck,"" he said.

Gontero noted that cognitive behavioral therapy might help build confidence in some men.

Long-term vacuum treatments did not appear effective, producing no significant physical changes after six months, Gontero said, but did provide a degree of psychological satisfaction.

He and his colleagues found no scientific evidence to support penile-lengthening exercises.

Dr. E. Douglas Whitehead, director of New York Phalloplasty and associate clinical professor of urology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, said suspensory ligament surgery to increase penis length can be more effective when combined with stretching techniques.

""The human body, even bone, can be stretched,"" he said. ""So stretching the penis, when done long enough, will work. If anything, libido and desire are even better because you look better and feel better about yourself.""

"John Jeffries, a 49-year-old money manager in Dover, Mass., had hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008 and is now coaching his son's basketball team and long-distance cycling.

Alex Douglas, a Wall Street software architect, had both knees replaced last year at 39 after years of sports injuries. He can't wait to go kite-boarding this weekend. ""I've been cleared to have fun,"" he says.

Joint-replacement patients these days are younger and more active than ever before. More than half of all hip-replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under 65, with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by 2016. The fastest-growing group is patients 46 to 64, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery.

Many active middle-agers are wearing out their joints with marathons, triathlons, basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations. They're also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary.

To accommodate them, implant makers are working to build joints with longer-wearing materials, and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements, hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures.

More younger people also need joint-replacement surgery due to obesity, and some orthopedists refer them for weight-loss surgery first to reduce complications later.

Even the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high-impact activities.

""There is, to be honest, some irrational exuberance out there,"" says Daniel Berry, chief of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. ""People may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them.""

One big unknown: How long will the replacement joints last? In the past, many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about 10 or 15 years, and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery—or even two. (A total knee replacement typically costs $15,000 to $22,000. A revision can be $45,000 or more, with a higher risk of complications.)

John Jeffries, 49, had his hip resurfaced in 2008. Dominick Reuter for The Wall Street Journal

Steven Haas, chief of the knee service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids, take walks, work or enjoy traveling. ""To them, the idea of being miserable in their 50s so they might not need another surgery in their 70s doesn't make much sense,"" he says.

Several studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that 85% to 90% are still functioning well after 20 years. Advances in wear-resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer.

For example, many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts, and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles. Scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation, so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer.

""Metal-on-metal"" hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic, but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients' bloodstreams and cause soft-tissue damage. Hip implants made with ""ceramic-on-ceramic"" components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak.

Last year, one manufacturer, Smith & Nephew, won clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its latest technology as a ""30-year knee"" based on tests mimicking 30 years of wear.

Still, there are no long-term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients. ""We have to install them and see,"" says Robert Namba, an orthopedic surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Irvine, Calif.

The biggest variable is patients themselves. As a rule, the more active they are, the faster their joints will wear out, loosen or require revision.

Most orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk, swim and cycle as much as possible. Golf and doubles tennis are acceptable. But jogging, running, jumping and singles tennis are out. ""If your goal is a 30-year knee, you need to avoid high-impact sports,"" says John Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston.

That said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing.

""If you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage, it will last forever and you won't have any fun,"" says Thomas Schmalzried, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. A former college basketball player, Dr. Schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints. ""I know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function. What I don't know—what nobody knows—is where the lines are for the average patient.""

Some doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery, (and as long as they avoid skiing moguls).

""There's a happy medium, and it's not necessarily the same for every patient,"" says Dr. Berry. ""One might say, 'I'm willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me,' and another might not.""

Personal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether—and when—a patient is ready for joint-replacement surgery.

""It got to the point where I couldn't get on my motorcycle anymore,"" says Paul Canter, a picture framer from Los Angeles who had a double hip replacement at 63 last year.

Chris Schubert was kicked by a horse when she was 25, then suffered a near-fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot. Mounting pain and inflammation over the next 14 years forced her to quit recreational horseback riding, interrupted her sleep and interfered with her work as a building contractor. She had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with Dr. Haas last year, at age 38, and her pain and limitations are gone. ""I thought my path in life was set and I'd just be miserable,"" she says. ""I never imagined my life could be this wonderful.""

Patients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. ""Pre-hab""—building up strength before the surgery—is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say.

""I was in the best shape of my life before I went in for the surgery,"" says Mr. Jeffries, the money manager, who trained twice a day for six months before his hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008.

And staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation. ""I made up my mind. If I was going to go through all this surgery and rehab, I wanted to make these hips last as long as they possibly can,"" says Carol Espel, 55, an executive of Equinox Fitness who damaged both hips dancing professionally and teaching fitness for years. Now she takes classes in cycling, yoga, Pilates and strength training weekly. ""No impact ever,"" she says.

Mark Liszt, the owner of a wholesale meat company in Los Angeles who had double knee replacement surgery in 2008 at the age of 60, says the first five months of rehab were very painful and discouraging. ""You're fighting to get range of motion back. You're fighting to break adhesions. You're fighting depression and you're wondering, 'Is an era of your life over?' "" But he worked through the pain and was back playing basketball a few months later.

Now 63, he still plays basketball twice a week. The surgery, he says, ""gave me my life back. I can pivot. I can do a hook shot. And I am completely pain free.""

THURSDAY, April 14, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- In the latest research to test the concept of an artificial pancreas for the management of type 1 diabetes, British researchers report that they were able to improve blood sugar control and reduce the risk of dangerous low blood sugars overnight.

An analysis of pooled data showed that the overall time that plasma glucose levels were in target ""increased by a median 28 percent"" with the artificial pancreas, said the study's lead author Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate at the University of Cambridge in the United Kingdom.

Hovorka's team is one of several working to produce an effective artificial pancreas, also known as a closed loop system or closed loop delivery.

An artificial pancreas combines existing diabetes management technology -- insulin pumps and continuous glucose monitors -- with a sophisticated computer algorithm that tells these devices what to do when blood sugar levels are rising or falling.

The closed loop insulin delivery system, for example, computes insulin doses and administers them according to glucose levels detected by a sensor. The hope is that an artificial pancreas will closely mimic the way the human pancreas normally releases insulin in response to food or stress.

An effective artificial pancreas has the potential to vastly improve the lives of people with type 1 diabetes. Type 1 diabetes is an autoimmune disease in which the body's immune system mistakenly attacks the insulin-producing beta cells in the pancreas. The autoimmune attack destroys so many beta cells that someone with type 1 diabetes can no longer produce the insulin the body needs.

Insulin is a hormone that's essential for the body to use sugar as fuel. Without replacement insulin, people with type 1 diabetes couldn't survive. But, replacing insulin isn't easy.

While too little insulin can be deadly, too much insulin can also cause serious problems, and in the worst case, coma and death. Replacing insulin is a delicate balancing act, requiring constant blood sugar monitoring.

Previous research suggests that in a 24-hour period, the average person with type 1 diabetes spends about 10 hours with blood sugar levels too high, and about an hour a day with blood sugar levels too low, according to Aaron Kowalski, assistant vice president for treatment therapies at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

The current study included 24 people with type 1 diabetes and challenged an artificial pancreas prototype in two different real-life scenarios. The first trial was meant to mimic a night of eating at home, while the second trial was designed to simulate an evening out, including drinking alcohol, which can unpredictably lower blood sugar levels.

For the eating-in portion of the randomized study, 12 of the study volunteers were assigned to consume a medium-sized meal (60 grams of carbohydrates) at 7 p.m., and then another half were placed on the artificial pancreas program during the night, while the other half maintained their standard insulin pump therapy. Several weeks later, the participants came back for another meal and switched overnight regimens.

The second arm of the trial simulated a meal out. The other 12 volunteers were given a larger meal (100 grams of carbohydrate) at 8:30 p.m., and were dispensed white wine along with their meal. As with the other trial, half were managed with the artificial pancreas while the others used conventional insulin pump therapy.

Both groups were monitored twice overnight in each study.

""For the eating-in scenario, overnight closed loop delivery increased the time plasma glucose levels were in target by a median 15 percent,"" said Hovorka. For the eating out scenario, the average time good blood sugar control was increased was 28 percent on average. And, when combined, the average increase in blood sugar control was 22 percent, according to the study.

Of greater concern to most people with type 1 diabetes is the ability to avoid low blood sugars while they're sleeping. The study found no serious low blood sugar events after midnight. There were four instances of severe hypoglycemia, but the researchers attributed three of them to insulin administered prior to the start of the study in the evening.

Results were published online in the British Journal of Medicine on April 14.

Although an accompanying journal editorial noted that the artificial pancreas is still ""in its infancy,"" some experts were cheered by the findings.

""This study is more good news, and we're seeing an evolution of more and more sophistication in this closed loop study,"" said Kowalski. ""What we're doing now is pressing these systems in real situations with the goal of getting to the next step of testing at home,"" he added.

Hovorka said his team is working on developing a home trial now, and hopes to begin home trials by the end of the year.

TUESDAY, April 12, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Eating apples every day may be good for your cardiovascular health, new research suggests.

Women who ate dried apples every day for a year lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent and their levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol by 23 percent.

""I never expected apple consumption to reduce bad cholesterol to this extent while increasing HDL cholesterol or good cholesterol by about 4 percent,"" Bahram Arjmandi, chair of the department of nutrition, food and exercise sciences at Florida State University in Tallahassee, said in a statement.

Arjmandi was to present the findings Tuesday at the Experimental Biology meeting in Washington D.C. The U.S. Department of Agriculture provided partial funding for the study.

Many foods can have an effect on cholesterol levels, according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Foods containing saturated fats, trans fats and dietary cholesterol can raise your cholesterol levels, while foods with healthier fats such as olive oil can lower your cholesterol. Foods with fiber, such as fruits, vegetables and whole grains, can reduce cholesterol levels, while carbohydrates that are low in fiber tend to raise triglyceride levels and lower ""good"" HDL cholesterol levels.

In the current study, the researchers wanted to assess the long-term effect that apple consumption might have on cardiovascular health.

They recruited 160 women between the ages of 45 and 65. The women were randomly assigned to one of two dietary intervention groups. One group was given 75 grams of dried apples every day for a year, while the other group was given dried prunes daily for a year.

The daily serving of dried apples contained about 240 calories, according to the study. An apple contains about 5 grams of fiber, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

The researchers found that women eating dried apples lowered their total cholesterol by 14 percent. LDL cholesterol dropped by 23 percent. Daily apple consumption also significantly lowered levels of C-reactive protein and lipid hydroperoxide, two substances that may indicate an increased risk of heart disease. What effects, if any, the prunes had on cholesterol levels were not mentioned in the study abstract.

The researchers theorized that the nutrients in apples may reduce inflammation in the body.

Despite the addition of several hundred calories a day to their diet, the apple-eating women didn't gain weight over the course of the study. In fact, they lost an average of 3.3 pounds.

Registered dietician Jessica Shapiro said she wasn't surprised that the women didn't gain weight. The addition of apples to the diet probably kept the women feeling fuller because of the fiber content in the apples, she explained.

""Apples really are an amazing fruit for many reasons,"" said Shapiro, who is a clinical nutritionist who counsels cardiac patients at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City. ""A large reason apples are so good is the fiber. Apples have both soluble and insoluble fiber. Insoluble is found more in the skin, and the pulp is more soluble fiber.""

""The pulp of an apple gets to be a very viscous gel-like substance that grabs cholesterol and pulls it out of the body. It's kind of like nature's toothbrush, and it's brushing the bad stuff out,"" she explained.

""Another good thing in apples is pectin. It's a substance that's used to make jellies or jams, and pectin contributes to the viscosity of what's going through the body, and bulks it up to help remove it. Apples also have tons of antioxidants and other natural components,"" she said.

Shapiro said she would recommend fresh apples over dried apples, because some nutrients are probably lost in the drying process.

But Shapiro stressed that making healthy changes to what you eat can only do so much.

""Changing your diet can make a big difference, but eating a healthy diet is only part of it. Once your cholesterol is high, diet may not be enough,"" she said. ""Some people are predisposed because of their genes to having high cholesterol, and a healthy diet may not be enough.""

Shapiro also advised against making any changes to your medications, including cholesterol-lowering drugs, without talking to your doctor first.

Also, she cautioned, when increasing the fiber in your diet, do it slowly. This will help prevent bloating and gas that may occur if you increase your fiber intake too quickly. She said that 25 to 30 grams of fiber daily is the recommended intake, and she suggested increasing your current intake by about 5 grams daily each week to give your body a chance to get used to the increased fiber.

"Strawberries have the potential to prevent esophageal cancer, according to a preliminary study released Wednesday.

Researchers, led by Ohio State University, were able to show that freeze-dried strawberries slowed the growth of dysplastic, or precancerous, lesions in about 30 people who consumed the fruit for six months.

The study's lead researcher, Tong Chen, an assistant professor in the oncology division of Ohio State University, presented the study at the American Association for Cancer Research's annual meeting.

Strawberries have the potential to prevent esophageal cancer, according to a preliminary study released Wednesday. European Pressphoto Agency

Esophageal cancer is the third most common gastrointestinal cancer and the sixth most frequent cause of cancer death in the world, Dr. Chen said. About 16,000 new cases of esophageal cancer a year are diagnosed in the U.S., according to the American Cancer Society.

Dr. Chen and a group of researchers are studying esophageal squamous cell carcinoma, the dominant type of esophageal cancer world-wide. They are looking at whether food or other substances might prevent cancer. Previous work showed that freeze-dried strawberries were able to significantly inhibit tumor development in rats.

The research team designed a small study in humans and approached the California Strawberry Commission, which agreed to fund the study and make available the freeze-dried strawberries. The commission is a state agency funded by the strawberry industry.

Dr. Chen's team recruited 38 people in China who had mild-to-moderate dysplasia in the esophagus; 36 people completed the study. Biopsies of the esophagus were taken before and after the study. On average, patients were about 55 years old.

They were instructed to consume 30 grams of freeze-dried strawberries dissolved in a glass of water twice daily for a total of 60 grams a day for six months. Dr. Chen said the freeze-dried substance is about 10 times as concentrated as fresh strawberries, but suggested people could still benefit from eating whole strawberries on a daily basis.

Overall, the results showed 29 out of 36 participants experienced a decrease in histological grade of the precancerous lesion, or a slowing in the growth of the lesion during the study. Dr. Chen said larger, randomized placebo-controlled studies are needed to confirm the results. She said it isn't clear exactly what the anti-cancer agent in strawberries might be. But she noted that strawberries contain a variety of vitamins, minerals and other substances known as phytochemicals, which are also found in some other types of berries.",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - Taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs such as Pfizer’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca’s Crestor could help prevent people dying from pneumonia, according to a study by British scientists released on Tuesday.

Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the risk of death in the six-month period after being diagnosed with pneumonia was substantially lower among those who were already taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs than in those who were not.

Previous studies have suggested statins, which are also available as cheaper generics, may be linked to better outcomes after bacterial infection. These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia.

Statins such as Lipitor, Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin are widely prescribed to lower so-called “bad” or LDL cholesterol — a risk factor for heart disease — and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes.

Separate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body’s immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday’s study.

“Statins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,” said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research.

“Given the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect.”

Douglas’s team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors’ practices in Britain to identify statin users.

They then matched each statin user — who was aged over 40 when first prescribed a statin between 1995 and 2006 — with up to five non-statin users for comparison.

Patients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users.

Douglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.",1
"April 4, 2011 -- Preventing pancreatic cancer may be an additional health benefit of using aspirin to treat everyday aches and pains or prevent heart disease.

A new study shows people who took aspirin at least once a month were 29% less likely to develop pancreatic cancer than those who used other types of pain relievers or nothing at all.

Researchers also found people who regularly take low-dose aspirin to reduce their risk of heart disease had a 35% lower risk of pancreatic cancer.

But researchers are quick to point out that aspirin may not be for everyone, and these results need to be confirmed by further studies. The study shows an association but is not designed to show cause and effect.

“The results are not meant to suggest everyone should start taking aspirin once monthly to reduce their risk of pancreatic cancer,” says researcher Xiang-Lin Tan, of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minn., in a news release. “Individuals should discuss use of aspirin with their physicians because the drug carries some side effects.”",0
"There’s some good news and some bad news for women who took estrogen to help them get through menopause until the health risks of taking the hormone were discovered.

A new analysis of the landmark Women’s Health Initiative, the federal study that discovered the health risks, indicates that women who stopped using estrogen after the dangers were uncovered are no longer at increased risk for strokes and blood clots about 10 years after they stopped. At the same time, the women continued to be at a lower risk for breast cancer. That’s the good news.

The bad news is that there is no benefit of being less likely to develop heart disease, and any reduction in the risk of hip bone fractures evaporates with time, according to a report in the latest issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

For years, women took estrogen or a combination of estrogen and progestin to help alleviate hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and in the belief that the drugs had a host of health benefits, including protecting their hearts. But the Women’s Health Initiative stunned doctors and women when researchers reported that the risks of the hormones outweighed any benefits. Hormone use plummetted, but women who had been using the drugs were left to wonder whether they were still at risk.

In the new analysis, researchers analyzed data collected from 7,645 women who were in the part of the study examining the effects of taking estrogen alone an average of 10.7 years, after the study was halted because of the evidence the drugs were harming women. The women had taken estrogen for about six years.

The researchers found that the risk for heart disease during the follow-up period was similar to that seen while the women were taking the hormone. But the increased risk for strokes and blood clots disappeared and the protective effect for breast cancer persisted. The protective effect for hip fractures disappeared. In fact, the women who took the hormone ended up being at somewhat higher risk for fractures.

In an editorial accompanying the study, Emily Jungheim and Graham Colditz of Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis wrote that the findings indicate that while there “may still be a role for short-term use of unopposed estrogen for treating some women with menopausal symptoms ... this role may be vanishing as existing and emerging data continue to be better understood.”

Rowan Chlebowski, one of the researchers who worked on the analysis, stressed that the study only looked at women who were taking estrogen alone. Women who took a combination of estrogen and progestin face increased risk for breast cancer, previous studies have shown, Chlebowski said.",1
"NEW ORLEANS (Reuters) - Abbott Laboratories Inc’s experimental Absorb heart stent, designed to dissolve and thereby restore the blood vessel’s natural flexibility, has proven safe and effective a year after being implanted in patients, researchers said.

The findings, which follow similarly promising 6-month and 9-month data on the plastic device, were described at the annual scientific sessions of the American College of Cardiology in New Orleans.

Abbott said 6.9 percent of patients suffered major cardiac events — including heart attacks — over a 12-month period, which the device maker described as a low rate. During the same period, no blood clots were reported among patients who were far enough along in testing to be evaluated in the 101-patient study.

Absorb, like traditional metal stents, is meant to prop open heart arteries that have been cleared of plaque. But unlike the millions of metal stents that are implanted in patients each year, it does not remain fixed in the arteries for life.

“The trial’s results would be equivalent to an excellent metallic stent - that type of performance,” said Dr. Patrick Serruys, a cardiologist from Erasmus University Hospital in Rotterdam, who led the study.

The stent was approved in Europe in January, but will not be widely available there until late next year. It was cleared by European regulators even though large so-called pivotal trials have not yet been conducted on the product.

Abbott plans to begin a 500-patient pivotal trial in Europe later this year and to conduct a 2,000-patient trial in the United States by the end of 2011. It hopes to seek U.S. approval for the product in 2015, several years before any competitor.

Serruys said current stents are essentially “cages” that hamper the flexibility of arteries and make them more prone to reclogging as they develop scar tissue and plaque builds up.

He said Absorb and stents like it will likely be the next generation of stents and ultimately improve outcomes for patients.

He said bioresorbable materials have great potential for other uses, particularly for stents to repair the pulmonary arteries and aortas of babies.

“The baby will grow and the biodegradable material will disappear,” he said. “That would be one compassionate use of it, a very serious application. Otherwise, you’d be forced to reopen the baby to remove metallic stents.”",1
"March 30, 2011 -- Two highly anticipated hepatitis C drugs are poised to usher in a new era in the treatment of the viral disease as early as this summer, experts say.

The Merck drug boceprevir and Vertex Pharmaceutical’s similar drug telaprevir are expected to win FDA approval within months, following phase III trials showing that both drugs boosted cure rates to around 70% when used with standard therapy.

The drugs will be used in patients with HCV genotype 1 -- the hardest to treat form of the viral infection.

Adding one of the drugs to the current two-drug regimen of peginterferon and ribavirin will make the treatment of hepatitis C more complex, but it will also cure a lot more people, hepatitis C specialist Donald M. Jensen, MD, of the University of Chicago Medical Center, tells WebMD.

“Triple-drug therapy represents a major advance in the treatment of hepatitis C for patients,” he says.

Results from two phase III boceprevir trials are published in the New England Journal of Medicine.",1

TUESDAY, March 29, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A minimally invasive treatment for enlarged prostate that limits blood supply to the prostate seems to be just as effective as surgery but without the risk of debilitating side effects, such as impotence and urinary incontinence.

The treatment -- called prostatic artery embolization, or PAE -- is ready to be used in certain patients, namely those with a prostate larger than 60 cubic centimeters, ""with severe lower urinary tract symptoms and a weakened urinary stream,"" said Dr. Joao Martins Pisco, lead author of a study slated to be presented March 29 at the annual meeting of the Society of Interventional Radiology in Chicago.

But other experts aren't so sure.

Drugs are used to treat most patients with an enlarged prostate, with only about 10 percent qualifying for surgery to remove the entire gland, said Dr. Elizabeth Kavaler, a urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City.

""Because medication is so effective, most of the patients that we treat surgically are in pretty bad shape,"" she added. And while this study showed some symptomatic improvement, it didn't have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery, she said.

Benign prostate hyperplasia, also known as enlarged prostate, is a non-cancerous condition familiar to millions of aging males. The condition occurs when the prostate gland slowly enlarges and presses on the urethra, constricting the flow of urine.

Enlarged prostate is characterized by a host of unpleasant symptoms, including weak or slow urine flow, an urgent need to urinate frequently, incomplete bladder emptying and having to get up repeatedly at night to urinate.

The surgery for enlarged prostate -- transurethral resection of the prostate, or TURP -- is used for men whose prostates are smaller than 60 to 80 cubic centimeters. The procedure is performed under general anesthesia and involves a hospital stay.

Meanwhile, there is no size limitation for PAE, which requires only local anesthesia and also lowers the risk of other side effects, such as blood loss and retrograde ejaculation, which occurs when semen leaks into the bladder, researchers said. PAE can be an outpatient procedure as well.

For the procedure, a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin. The catheter delivers tiny ""grains"" to the arteries that lead to the prostate, which block blood flow and lead to shriveling of the gland.

In this study, PAE helped most of the 67 patients who underwent the procedure, according to the researchers, who noted that 66 men who had not responded to medications experienced improvements in symptoms as well as a reduction in prostate volume. After nine months, none had experienced sexual dysfunction and 25 percent still reported improvements.

However, the authors did not see as great an improvement in ""urodynamic"" results, such as improved flow rate of the urine, which would indicate how well the bladder and urethra are performing; in this area, the patients did not improve as much as those who underwent TURP surgery, they noted.

Another drawback is that few doctors are trained in PAE so far, said Pisco, chair of radiology at Hospital Pulido Valente and professor in the Faculty of Medical Sciences at New University of Lisbon in Portugal.

Other minimally invasive treatments for enlarged prostate that are currently available are less effective and have a greater risk of a need for reoperation, according to background materials that accompanied the study.

Dr. Franklin Lowe, associate director of urology at St. Luke's-Roosevelt Hospital in New York City, said PAE was ""unlikely"" to be used much to treat enlarged prostate.

Current surgical procedures typically require no more than one night in the hospital and complications such as incontinence and impotence are uncommon, he said.

""PAE is potentially fraught with complications,"" Lowe said, adding that the study follow-up of less than one year was short for a disease that lasts decades.

Since the study is being presented at a medical meeting and has not yet been published in a peer-reviewed journal, the findings should be considered preliminary.

"March 29, 2011 -- A minimally invasive procedure that cuts off the blood supply to an enlarged prostate may help when medications fail, and it appears to provide good symptom control without sexual dysfunction, a new study shows.

The procedure involves using a tiny catheter that is threaded through arteries near the groin to reach the vessels that supply the prostate with blood. These vessels are then blocked with particles the size of a grain of sand.

A similar procedure is sometimes used to treat another kind of benign growth, uterine fibroids, in women.

“It was my inspiration -- uterine fibroids. It’s the same kind of growth,” says study researcher Joao Martins Pisco, MD, chief radiologist at Hospital Pulido Valente and director of interventional radiology at St. Louis Hospital, both in Lisbon, Portugal. “The results are excellent.”

In a small pilot study, most men were able to leave the hospital four to eight hours after the procedure, which is called prostatic artery embolization (PAE), researchers report.

PAE reduced the symptoms of frequency and urgency of urination without causing side effects like incontinence, sexual dysfunction, retrograde ejaculation (ejaculation into the bladder), or bleeding.

Despite the promising results of this small trial, experts said it was far too early to recommend PAE to patients.

“There are a lot of questions. We really don’t know what the short- and long-term success or complication rates are,” says Anthony Malizia Jr., MD, president and director of the Malizia Clinic, a nonprofit urology specialty center in Atlanta. “We don’t know how well these particles are localized to the prostate or if they’re going to the pelvis or other parts of the body.”

Malizia notes that in one serious complication reported in the study, the particles appeared to migrate and kill a small part of the bladder wall. The authors report that the dead tissue required surgical removal.

The study was presented at the Society of Interventional Radiology annual meeting in Chicago.",1
"Alexander Technique: A Balm For Back Pain?

If you ever saw the musicals ""Wicked"" in San Francisco or ""Cats"" on the road, you've probably heard Joe Rodriguez blasting on his trumpet. I met him recently at the musicians' union hall in downtown San Francisco.

But hitting those notes night after night in a cramped orchestra pit takes a toll on the musicians.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Josephine Gray Josephine Gray

""The fact of having your arms up and carrying the weight of this instrument and pushing the instrument toward you and so you have this stress, this wall you're pushing against,"" says Rodriguez. ""And a well designed instrument will push back.""

He's been a working trumpet player for four decades, and all that back-arching and shoulder-pinching has left him with chronic pain in his lower back. Research suggests an alternative therapy called Alexander Technique may be an effective way to treat back pain.

Rodriguez first tried massage, chiropractic, and powerful pain killers. But finding a remedy for back pain can be a lot like a guessing game.

He says it was only through Alexander Technique lessons that he trained his body to move in a way that eased his aching back. Alexander Technique is a series of posture lessons, devised by a 19th century Australian actor named F.M. Alexander who had troubles with chronic laryngitis whenever he performed.

""It's a feeling of working with yourself from the inside out,"" says Rodriguez. ""If you know you're twisting a certain way and using too much force, it's easy enough to know, Let that go.""

In particular, Joe now holds himself differently during his solos because of Alexander Technique.

""I know that I can just sort of be on my sits bones, instead of a funny arch with my stomach pushed out or my back arched in some strange way,"" says Rodriguez

Josephine Gray is Rodriguez's teacher and is a certified instructor in Alexander Technique. When I visited her, I was on my hands and knees next to her trying to re-learn how to stand up.

""Let the neck be free, the head go forward and up,"" Gray tells me.

Once I make it to my feet, feeling somewhat like a newborn giraffe, there's a beautiful view of the San Francisco Bay out of the studio window.

Gray teaches the technique and says low back pain is a common complaint of clients.

A summary of the results of a major back pain study published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. The study showed that the Alexander Technique was highly effective in treating back pain. British Medical Journal YouTube

""We look at what you are doing that causes that problem in the first place, so how you sit at the computer or how you pick up your child or what you do when you're driving,"" says Gray. ""I look at ways of changing your postural habits so you don't get into pain.""

These aren't static postures, though. Those who promote the technique say its more about how you move, and training yourself to release tension.

These are subtle – tiny, almost imperceptible shifts. And although the teacher will put her hand on your neck or shoulder, it's more to bring awareness than to make adjustments.

""The whole point is that you understand the process so that you can arrive there yourself,"" says Gray.

Gray and Rodriguez, the trumpet player, both say the lessons are no cure all. But there is evidence it can ease chronic low back pain over the long run.

Paul Little is a primary care researcher at the University of Southampton in Britain. He led a study of some 460 patients who were given Alexander lessons, massage, or the usual care of pain killers and exercise.

After a year, those who had massage were no better off. Those who had six Alexander lessons showed some improvement. And those who went the distance got the best results.

""The people who had 24 lessons had gone down from about 21 days of pain that the usual care group reported to about 3 days in pain,"" says Little. ""So a really dramatic difference there is reported days in pain.""

Little's research was published in the British Medical Journal in 2008. But now he wants to figure out why it appears to work.

He's about to start a new study that involves giving chronic back pain sufferers lessons in the Alexander Technique and exercises, and then measuring how far their spines can twist and the size and strength of their deep lumbar muscles – which Little thinks might work poorly in people with chronic low back pain.

He cautions though that it may be something else entirely that accounts for the apparent success of the Alexander Technique. If that's the case, Little says he'll have to go back to the drawing board.",1
"It may seem novel for a nonbeauty company to get into skin care, but these days, it really isn’t, Mrs. Lewis said. “There are ingredient suppliers that provide ingredients to health care, food and drink industries, and cosmetic companies,” she said. In Japan, “food and health care companies have found cosmetic applications for their ingredients, so they are creating skin care brands.”

For example, Frutarom, a flavor-ingredient house based in Israel, makes Alguard, a purified polysaccharide shield from a red microalgae that it says protects skin from daily assaults and reduces roughness as well as the look of fine lines.

There are more than 100 algae-derived ingredients used in cosmetics worldwide, Mrs. Lewis said. The patent-pending alguronic acid in Algenist is a “single, purified, highly bioactive compound,” said Tony Day, the vice president for research and development at Solazyme, and therefore delivers “much higher activity to the skin” than products using only a microalgae extract.

Studies conducted by an independent lab and commissioned by Algenist, none of which have been published in a peer-reviewed journal, showed alguronic acid increased cell regeneration and the synthesis of elastin (which gives skin that snap-back youthful quality). This testing also demonstrated that alguronic acid provided protection against cell damage induced by ultraviolet rays, and inhibited the enzymes that break down elastin.

After reviewing press materials and Solazyme’s 84-page patent application, Dr. David McDaniel, a dermatologist and the director of the Institute of Anti-Aging Research in Virginia Beach, Va., said he was impressed by the in-vitro testing of alguronic acid. “In the petri dish, their data seems to show some substantial benefits to their active ingredient,” he said. But he cautioned that in-vitro testing does not demonstrate how a final formulation works off the shelf.

Dr. Dana Sachs, an associate professor of dermatology at the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, wrote in an e-mail after looking at Algenist’s dossier that “the claims on cell regeneration and elastin synthesis are based on in vitro models, which is hard to extrapolate to in vivo, and again no statistical significance is presented, so this is a weak claim.”

Dr. Day, who has a doctorate in biochemistry, said that statistical significance was found but not included in press materials. And, according to the company, a study of 30 women showed that after 10 days of using the Algenist serum, they had a 25 percent decrease in wrinkles as shown by silicone replicas of their faces.

Dr. Ellen Marmur, the chief of the division of dermatologic and cosmetic surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, did say Algenist could fairly claim that alguronic acid offers protection against ultraviolet damage to cells, and that she might use the product as “a nice sun protection on top of S.P.F. protection.”

Algenist literature touts alguronic acid’s superiority to hyaluronic acid, retinol and vitamin C, among other anti-aging ingredients, in encouraging elastin synthesis and cell regeneration. But Dr. McDaniel, who does research into using plant-derived products to lengthen the life of cells, says he thinks the comparative data must be viewed with caution because the studies that yielded it are “challenging to do accurately, hard to interpret and not necessarily predictive of final products.”

Soon, consumers will judge whether Algenist products are a breakthrough. In an unusual move, Sephora is introducing the line in 800 locations in 8 countries all at once, in a rollout coordinated with QVC. “It was a brand nobody has ever heard of,” said Allen Burke, the senior adviser for beauty strategy and development at QVC. “We want to give it a lot of visibility all at the same time.” But Mr. Burke knows that marketing has its limits. “It can be the most interesting story in the world,” he said. “But if it doesn’t deliver, it’s not a business that we can do.”",1
"Whether you've been relatively inactive or fairly athletic, age is the enemy of one of the most important sets of muscles in the body: the group of four known as the rotator cuff that surround the ball of the shoulder joint.

About 54% of adults older than 60 have a completely or partially torn rotator cuff, compared with just 4% of those between 40 and 60. But tears are most frequently caused by degeneration of the tendon due to age, rather than injury from sports or trauma. Studies show that tears can be managed without surgery in half of patients, mainly through physical therapy, pain medications, and avoiding activities that cause pain.

But one's strength tends not to improve without surgery to reattach tendons to the ball of the shoulder joint. So, the question for many patients who want to have full use of their shoulder is less whether to have surgery than when and how. In a recent review in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers noted that patients and doctors struggle with when to stop nonoperative treatment in favor of surgery, but that repairing a tear earlier rather than later may result in better patient outcomes, earlier return to work and lower costs.

The Price of Delay

""Many patients who have a tear figure they can take six months and live with it, but left alone the tear will progress and you can get to the point where it is irreparable,"" says David Altchek, a surgeon at New York's Hospital for Special Surgery. Dr. Altchek says repairing torn rotator cuffs earlier with a new technique that uses a double row of sutures to fix tendons to bone, rather than a single row, is improving healing rates in his studies.

While some tears may never worsen or need surgery, says Ken Yamaguchi, an orthopedic surgeon at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, ""the older somebody is when they get a repair, the less likely it is for the repair to heal.""

The good news is that surgery results in reduced pain and improved function in 80% to 95% of patients. And open surgery with big incisions is being replaced by new, less-invasive techniques known as mini-open and arthroscopic repair, which involve less pain and blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a generally easier rehabilitation period, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons.

Ask Your Doctor

The academy, which recently updated its guidelines for rotator-cuff repair, doesn't recommend for or against a specific technique for surgery. Dr. Yamaguchi, vice chairman of a working group that developed the guidelines, says there isn't enough high-quality evidence to recommend any specific technique, a conclusion also reached by the Annals of Internal Medicine researchers. He advises that patients confer with surgeons about their options.

The most common procedure is mini-open repair, which uses a smaller incision than traditional open repair. To remove any bone spurs, a surgeon uses arthroscopic, pencil-size instruments to magnify and illuminate the structures inside the joint. Once that is completed, the surgeon repairs the rotator cuff through the small incision. But some surgeons are now performing the entire operation using the small camera-guided instruments, in what's known as an all-arthroscopic procedure.

There are possible complications with all surgical procedures, of course. An Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons review of about 40 published studies showed that as many as 2% of patients have nerve injuries, while 1% may get an infection at the surgical site. About 6% may have a tendon re-tear, though that doesn't mean a repeat surgery will be needed or that pain and poor function will result.

Lengthy Recovery

And as with any surgery, postoperative recovery depends largely on how well patients adhere to their physical-therapy regimens. Initially, that means being extra careful: A repair needs to be protected until the tendon heals strongly to the bone. Patients may be advised to use a sling for the first four to six weeks after surgery and to limit active use of the arm. Therapy usually starts with passive-motion exercises, then range-of-motion exercises continue during the next six to 12 weeks. It can take as long as six months after surgery to return to a functional range of motion and adequate strength.

Eric Taylor, a 62-year-old documentary filmmaker who plays sports like tennis with his right arm, says he was surprised when he began developing pain in his left shoulder. He tried to ease it by doing yoga, but after six months with no relief, he scheduled an MRI. It confirmed that a bone spur digging into a tendon had caused a tear in the left rotator cuff.

He scheduled surgery with Dr. Altchek at the Hospital for Special Surgery last June, but wishes he had acted sooner. Because he waited so long, he says, his surgery required three incisions instead of one. He was surprised at how much work was involved in rehabilitation but has been diligent about his recovery and physical therapy.

Back to playing tennis now, Mr. Taylor says, ""When it comes to our own bodies, as baby boomers we've always been active, and we are going to stay active any way we can.""

"March 20, 2011 -- Elevated levels of a group of five amino acids may predict the development of diabetes years before any noticeable symptoms occur, according to a new study.

Researchers found that blood tests that screened for these amino acids accurately predicted risk of type 2 diabetes in otherwise healthy adults as well as in those with traditional risk factors such as obesity.

""These findings could provide insight into metabolic pathways that are altered very early in the process leading to diabetes,"" says researcher Thomas Wang, MD, of Massachusetts General Hospital's Cardiovascular Research Center, in a news release. ""They also raise the possibility that, in selected individuals, these measurements could identify those at highest risk of developing diabetes so that early preventive measures could be instituted.""

Researchers say metabolic abnormalities that eventually lead to type 2 diabetes can be present years before diabetes is diagnosed. For example, insulin resistance, where the body does not use insulin effectively, occurs long before blood sugars reach the level seen in type 2 diabetes.",1

Sheiner suspected he had sleep apnea because it ran in his family. But he was not overweight, which is the biggest risk factor for the disorder — some 60 percent to 90 percent of patients diagnosed with apnea have a body mass index, or BMI, over 28.

A sleep study confirmed Sheiner had one of the worst cases of apnea his doctors had ever seen. After trying a number of different treatments, his doctors finally tried a surgery using robots to treat his stubborn apnea — with positive results.

'Gasping For Breath'

According to Erica Thaler, an ear, nose and throat surgeon at the Hospital of the University of Pennsylvania, Sheiner's sleep study found that he woke up about 112 times every hour. That meant Sheiner stopped breathing for at least 10 seconds about two times every minute.

Sleep apnea is a chronic and common sleep disorder. People with this condition stop breathing while sleeping.

Like Sheiner, they often find themselves suddenly and repeatedly gasping for breath during the night. Their airway is clogged, sometimes because their tonsils and tonsilar tissue in the back of their throat are enlarged.

This was exactly the case for Sheiner.

""Daniel's obstruction was both at the level of the soft palate and at the back of the tongue,"" Thaler says. ""He had very large tonsils, but his tonsil tissue was also enlarged in the palate area and also at the back of his tongue.""

Sheiner was put on a nighttime breathing machine. In bed he wore a face mask, which was connected to a tube that was connected to a device that pumped air into his nose and mouth.

The Continuous Positive Airway Pressure machine, or CPAP, as it is often referred to, works for about half of all patients who try it. It can be cumbersome, Thaler says.

But Sheiner was extremely committed to trying it. In fact, he tried a number of different types of machines, but none of them worked.

Handing Surgery Off To Robots

So Thaler suggested a type of robotic surgery currently used to remove cancerous tumors at the back of the throat. Thaler was starting to perform it on sleep apnea patients, to remove tonsils and excess tissue.

""What the robot allows you to do is get into a small, confined space without using hands,"" Thaler says. ""Human hands are huge, and robot hands are tiny, and yet they can do exactly the same thing if you control them remotely.""

So, about a year ago, Thaler performed surgery on Sheiner, removing both his tonsils and excess tissue. Sheiner is one of only about a half-dozen patients to have this robotic surgery for apnea.

After surgery, Sheiner says, ""it was a whole new life."" He had energy, an ability to focus and get things done. ""I find myself solving problems much more quickly and more confidently.""

He's exercising at the gym three times a week, lifting weights. He is also starting to experiment with recipes and cooking, something he had absolutely no energy or interest in doing before the surgery.

Surgery Not For Everyone

The surgery Sheiner had isn't right for everyone. Rashmi N. Aurora is a sleep specialist at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. She is also chairwoman of the Standards of Practice Committee of the American Academy of Sleep Medicine.

""I wouldn't send a middle-age obese man for surgery as their first option,"" Aurora says. ""I would say let's lose the weight; let's use CPAP and see a nutritionist; let's avoid the alcohol and let's see how you do."" The apnea can probably be taken care of with these noninvasive techniques, she says, and invasive surgery can be avoided.

But when she sees a young, thin person with severe apnea, Aurora says, surgery might be the answer.

""The upper airway starts with the nose and mouth and runs down to the vocal chords, so there's a lot of room for obstruction to occur,"" Aurora says. Some patients may require surgery to remove the uvula or the tonsils or excess tissue, or all of them, she says. Then, there's surgery to remove blockage in the nasal passage.

Oftentimes, Aurora says, patients need a series of surgeries to completely treat apnea. And even then, success rates aren't high; they're effective only 20 to 30 percent of the time.

The only surgery proved effective more than 90 percent of the time is a significant and highly invasive surgery. Maxillomandibular advancement, or MMA, involves literally slicing the jaw in half and moving it forward in order to widen the patient's airway.

For patients with recessed chins, small jaws and airways narrowed by facial structure, this might be the surgery for them. But it can take nearly a year to recover, and many patients opt not to have it.

The ""new"" CPAP machines are more sophisticated, Aurora says. They're less cumbersome, less noisy and can actually ""sense"" the magnitude of blockage and adjust air pressure being blown into the nose or mouth, she says. Noninvasive measures are always the first lines of defense, she says.",1
"Say Aaa! Then Zzz: Tonsillectomy Helps Kids Sleep

toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR

Getting your tonsils out used to be just part of childhood — a rite of passage for children in the 1950s and '60s. Then it fell out of favor.

But tonsillectomy is back.

Today, the most common reason for the surgery is ""sleep disordered breathing,"" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore.

Doctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats.

Back then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad's tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn't need it.

Turning Point For Tonsillectomies

It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections. People were growing up with their tonsils.

The tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body's immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs.

Then doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn't until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections.

""It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,"" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. ""People were growing up with their tonsils.""

But growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR Maggie Starbard/NPR

""It was loud,"" Moran says. ""You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing.""

At first, Tyler's pediatrician thought he'd outgrow the snoring. But he wasn't sleeping well and often didn't have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler's adenoids were enlarged, they weren't that bad.

By then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen.

""But the real problem is the tonsils!"" Moran recalls. ""He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat — very small.""

Enlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy.

Complications From Surgery

But Tyler's parents were worried about the surgery. It's usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That's never without some risk.

""Your child is under,"" says Moran, ""completely under. This is not a local.""

Other complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital.

Despite hundreds of studies, there's still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial.

What's A Sleep Study? Sleep studies are a way for doctors to diagnose sleep disorders like apnea by observing patients overnight while they sleep. During a sleep study, the patient is connected to an array of sensors monitoring brainwaves, eye movements, heart rate, breathing and blood-oxygen levels. This information, called a polysomnogram, lets doctors see whether the patient has stopped breathing and for how long. Apnea in adults happens when 10 seconds pass without breathing; for children, it's a disruption of two cycles of inhaling and exhaling. Some patients can also use portable sleep monitors to record what's happening in their sleep as an alternative to the sleep study, but that approach is not as comprehensive. Many sleep disorders can be diagnosed without costly sleep studies, which can run anywhere from $600 to several-thousand dollars. More children are undergoing sleep studies as awareness of the condition — particularly in children — rises. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says about 2 percent of children have obstructive sleep apnea. Before a sleep study is ordered, doctors typically ask for medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. — Eliza Barclay

No less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: "" 'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid's tonsils out.' ""

Rosenfeld disputes Obama's claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery.

Sleep Study Before Tonsillectomy

The picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered.

About 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children.

With sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They'd recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years.

There have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children.

Tyler's family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards.

A year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. ""Completely gone,"" his mom says. ""You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps.""

Tyler still hears snoring at night, he says. But he knows that the culprit is not him, or the family dog. It's Dad.",1

TUESDAY, March 8, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture may help reduce the severity of hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, according to a small study.

The research included 53 postmenopausal women, with about half receiving traditional Chinese acupuncture twice a week and the others given sham acupuncture treatments.

After 10 weeks, the women in the traditional acupuncture group had significantly less severe hot flashes and mood swings than those who'd gotten the fake treatment. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of vaginal dryness and urinary tract infection.

The beneficial effects of traditional acupuncture, according to the researchers, did not appear to be associated with changes in levels of hormones that trigger menopause and its associated symptoms.

The findings were published online March 7 in Acupuncture in Medicine.

Though the researchers acknowledged that they did not monitor how long symptom relief lasted, they suggested that traditional acupuncture may offer an alternative for women who can't or don't want to use hormone replacement therapy to ease menopause symptoms.

"By now, you've probably heard all the buzz about the Mediterranean diet, or perhaps you've tried it. Aside from helping to prevent the metabolic syndrome– a cluster of risk factors for heart disease and diabetes- a new study in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology says, the diet can have positive global effects on the individual risk factors: low HDL (""good"") cholesterol, high triglycerides, high blood pressure and a high blood sugar rate, as seen by your doctor through a blood test. In addition, waist size is a risk factor- a waist more than 35 inches for women and 40 inches for men is of concern.

The syndrome is present when someone has three of those five risk factors.

""[The study is] one of the first studies that evaluated the role of Mediterranean diet on metabolic syndrome, and revealed a beneficial association- quite a big influence, taking into account that the Mediterranean diet is a non-pharmacological mean,"" said study author Demosthenes Panagiotakos, from the Department of Science of Dietetics-Nutrition at Harokopio University of Athens in Greece.

Take this test to see how well you're managing your diabetes

The researchers looked at over half a million people from 50 previous studies on the Mediterranean diet, which included people in Spain, Greece, the U.S., France, Sweden, Italy and Australia, among other countries.

They found the beneficial effects from diets rich in fruits and vegetables, olives and olive oil, low-fat dairy products and whole grain cereals. Other components included: a moderate daily intake of alcohol with meals- mostly from red wine; eating fish, poultry or tree nuts (like walnuts or cashews) weekly; and limiting eating red meat to about twice a month. The researchers say what's responsible are the antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects.

Panagiotakos added that the diet includes all main food groups, but in a balanced way. The study notes physical activity is also an important part in preventing the risk factors for the metabolic syndrome.

Tips for managing your diabetes

The Mediterranean diet isn't just a little extra olive oil, noted Dr. Robert Eckel, an endocrinologist and past president of the American Heart Association.

""It's all these other components,"" Eckel said.

""I think the health professional needs to recognize that people that meet the criteria for the metabolic syndrome are at higher risk [for heart disease and diabetes] and we strongly recommend that lifestyle intervention is used to prevent the syndrome and also to modify its prevalence,"" he said.

According to the American Heart Association, data from 2003-2006 shows a third of adults age 20 and older met that criteria. And just a few years earlier, over 9 percent of adolescents ages 12-19 were classified as having the syndrome. That translates into 2.9 million young people.

But it's not only in the U.S.

""This is a global epidemic,"" Eckel emphasized. ""This is not simply America. It's occurring throughout Mexico, Central and South America, Southeast Asia, Australia and around the world.""

Eckel said obesity is by far the largest issue responsible for the metabolic syndrome. According to the World Health Organization's 2008 figures, at least one in three of the world's adult population is overweight, and almost one in 10 people is obese. For children, the numbers are also sobering: 20 million kids under age 5 are overweight.

Panagiotakos concludes that this pattern of eating can be easily adopted by people of various cultures and populations.

""The macro-environment we are living promotes obesity in all age groups of people... the choice of a healthy diet, like the Mediterranean diet, is on our hands. Better eating (from childhood to older life) contributes to better quality of life,"" he said.",1
"March 7, 2011 -- Traditional Chinese acupuncture may be useful in reducing the severity of hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, a new study suggests.

Researchers in Turkey conducted experiments with 53 postmenopausal women. Half of them received traditional acupuncture treatment. The rest were treated with “sham” acupuncture needles that were blunted and did not penetrate the skin.

A five-point scale was used to measure the severity of hot flashes, vaginal dryness, urinary symptoms, mood swings, and other symptoms in the postmenopausal women.

Twenty-seven women received traditional Chinese acupuncture twice a week for 10 sessions from an experienced and licensed acupuncturist. Those in the comparison group were treated with shams needles at the same acupuncture points.

Levels of estrogen and other hormones were measured before the study and after the first and last acupuncture sessions in both those receiving real and sham treatments.",0

SUNDAY, March 6, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A simple blood test may one day offer a safe way to detect Down syndrome during pregnancy, researchers say.

In a small study, an experimental blood test identified a gene mutation associated with Down syndrome with 100 percent accuracy, according to the Cyprus scientists.

""Down syndrome is a common birth defect, with one Down syndrome birth in every 600 births in all populations,"" said lead researcher Philippos Patsalis, chief executive medical director of the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics in Nicosia. ""This is due to an extra chromosome 21, and that leads to physical and mental impairment.""

""With our method we identify all normal and all Down syndrome [pregnancies],"" Patsalis said.

Currently, Down syndrome is diagnosed using one of two invasive procedures, amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling. Because these tests, while 80 percent accurate, carry a 1 percent to 2 percent risk of miscarriage, only about one in 10 pregnant women opts for them, he said.

The new test eliminates the risk of miscarriage, Patsalis said.

It also can identify Down syndrome in the 11th week of pregnancy, early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses, Patsalis said.

Although Down syndrome varies in severity, it usually causes some intellectual impairment and distinguishing facial features. Heart defects and other health problems are also common, according to the March of Dimes. Older mothers are more likely to give birth to Down syndrome babies.

People with Down syndrome, also known as Trisomy 21, carry three copies of chromosome 21, instead of two.

For the study, published online March 6 in Nature Medicine, Patsalis and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women and mothers of Down syndrome and healthy babies. In each case, the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation, identifying 14 Down syndrome cases and 26 normal fetuses, the study authors said.

If larger clinical trials confirm the results, the test could become standard practice, Patsalis said. ""The cost is much lower than the invasive procedures,"" he said. ""We estimate we can introduce this to clinical practice in a couple of years.""

Dr. Brian Skotko, clinical fellow in genetics at Children's Hospital Boston and a spokesman for the National Down Syndrome Society, said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of Down syndrome.

With this new test, women will know if their baby has Down syndrome even before they look pregnant, Skotko said. ""So they will be able to make a very personal decision without anyone realizing it,"" he said.

Noting that most of his Down syndrome patients say they lead fulfilling lives, Skotko said, ""The overwhelming majority of family members say they can't imagine their life without their family member with Down syndrome.""

"NICOSIA/LONDON (Reuters) - Pregnant women may soon be able to have a blood test to predict whether their babies are likely to have Down’s Syndrome instead of undergoing risky, invasive tests, scientists said on Sunday.

In a study in the Nature Medicine journal researchers from Cyprus said a trial on 40 pregnancies using the test, which involves analyzing the woman’s blood to detect DNA differences between the mother and the fetus, showed it accurately predicted which fetuses were at risk of developing the syndrome.

Philippos Patsalis, medical director of the Cyprus Institute of Neurology and Genetics, who led the study, said the results were “very exciting” and the test now needed to be trialed in a larger study of about 1,000 pregnancies, but could lead to changes in clinical practice within two years.

“We believe we can modify this test and make it much easier and simple... (and then) we can have something ready to be introduced into the clinic,” he told Reuters in Nicosia.

Down’s Syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation, occurring in 1 out of 700 live births worldwide.

The risk of having a baby with Down’s — which occurs when a child has three copies of chromosome 21 instead of the normal two — increases sharply as women get older. The risk for a 40-year-old mother is 16 times that for one who is 25.

Doctors currently use a test known as amniocentesis to check whether a baby is likely to be born with Down’s. This test is generally done at about 15 or 16 weeks gestation and involves taking amniotic fluid from the mother by inserting a hollow needle into the uterus.

Since amniocentesis carries a small risk of spontaneous miscarriage — Patsalis put it at around one or two percent — scientists have been looking for new less invasive ways to test for Down’s and other potential genetic problems.

Patsalis’ method takes advantage of differences in the DNA methylation patterns — which are important to control levels of genes — between mother and fetus.

It involves taking a small amount of blood from the mother when she is between the 11th and 13th week of her pregnancy and detecting extra copies chromosome 21 in the fetus by analyzing the maternal blood.

In a small trial, Patsalis’ team were able to correctly diagnose 14 cases where there were extra copies of the chromosome, and 26 normal fetuses — results they said highlighted its clinical potential.

“Such a non-invasive approach will avoid the risk of miscarriages of normal pregnancies caused by current, more invasive procedures,” the scientists wrote in their paper.",1
"A study finds that use of virtual colonoscopy, a non-invasive way of scanning the colon for potentially cancerous growths, is on the rise.

That’s a bit of a surprise, given that not all medical experts agree on whether the virtual screen is as reliable as a traditional colonoscopy, in which doctors insert a scope with a small camera into the colon. Plus, Medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy, but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy. Add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like Katie Couric, who allowed TV cameras in as she got her first test, and it’s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin.

But in spite of those challenges, Megan McHugh at the Health Research and Educational Trust in Chicago and her team report that about 17% of hospitals in the U.S. now offer the screening test, up from 13% in 2005.

As its name implies, virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope. Patients lie in a CT scanner, which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles, and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways. The images can be viewed as two dimensional CT scans, which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon. Or, the images can be combined to generate a 3D view of the colon, allowing the doctors to “fly through” the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions.

The prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same — the dreaded “colon cleanse” that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure. The night before the test, they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isn’t mistaken for a tumor during the screen.

While the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does, it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation. But according to Dr. Marc Gollub, director of CT and gastrointestinal radiology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, “the radiation is much lower than a regular CT scan and has not been proven to be of any risk. It’s similar to [the exposure from cosmic radiation] you might get on a long airplane flight.”

While a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors, not all cancer experts agree that it’s a good alternative to the gold-standard scope. While the American Cancer Society, the American College of Physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a congressionally mandated but non-federal, independent group of medical experts, concluded the evidence wasn’t strong enough to justify Medicare coverage of the service.

So which one is right for you? Virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can’t be sedated for colonoscopy, or who simply can’t tolerate the scope. In McHugh’s survey, hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use. And given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan, more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services. The virtual scan does involve radiation exposure, and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed, you’ll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway (to avoid another colon cleanse, consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed). But Gollub notes that only about 8% of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors.

Given the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy, it’s worth discussing with your doctor. In the end, it’s a matter of personal preference — it’s less important how you get screened, just that you do get screened.",1
"As a nicotine-gum addict, Mike Metzger used to worry about the warning on its label: ""Stop using the nicotine gum at the end of 12 weeks.""

But that was before a prominent smoking-cessation scientist, K. Michael Cummings, told him to keep chewing the gum as long as it helped him stay off cigarettes. So 15 years after quitting smoking, Mr. Metzger, a 63-year old retired New York telephone worker, still chews 16 pieces of nicotine gum a day.

Public health officials are backing away from recommending against the long-term use of nicotine gum, lozenges and patches. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to eliminate the 12-week warning and instead recommend nicotine-based quit-smoking aids for extended—perhaps even permanent—use. Anti-tobacco activists and GlaxoSmithKline PLC, the U.S.'s leading marketer of nicotine-replacement therapy, or NRT, are also backing the potential move.

""There really doesn't appear to be any great harm"" with long-term use of NRT, says Mr. Cummings, chair of the department of health behavior in the cancer-prevention division at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.. ""You're better off chewing gum or wearing a patch than smoking.""

By giving former smokers the most addictive chemical in cigarettes—nicotine—NRT is designed to ease the difficulty of quitting. In more than a quarter century on the market, nicotine gum, lozenges and patches have amassed a strong safety record. Even among most long-term NRT users, the hazards of nicotine pale beside the dangers of smoking, which is the number one cause of lung cancer and the most preventable cause of cardiac death.

Nicotine itself is not believed by scientists to raise the risk of developing cancer. It may raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, however. It can elevate heart rate, constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Some people have adverse skin reactions to nicotine patches.

Like other addictive substances, nicotine essentially hijacks the brain's reward system, conditioning users to associate intake with pleasure. But while other addictive drugs tend either to stimulate or relax users, nicotine can do both, depending on the user's mood, giving it a particularly tight grip.

Sudden withdrawal from the drug can induce intense cravings, nervousness, irritability, confusion and insomnia, among other symptoms.

Obtaining nicotine from gum, lozenge or patch doesn't replace entirely the pleasure of smoking any more than popping a tablet of caffeine—the addictive element in coffee—could equal the pleasure of a fresh-brewed cup of cappuccino. But jolts of nicotine can reduce the physical symptoms of withdrawal while quitters battle longings for the taste of tobacco, the sensation of smoke and various rituals that accompany the habit. (Going off NRT can also lead to withdrawal symptoms.)

Studies, typically funded by NRT-manufacturers, have shown that those who use the products are about twice as likely to quit smoking after 12 weeks, compared to those who don't use NRT. But studies of those who successfully quit outside of NRT clinical trials often show no NRT advantage over the cold-turkey approach.

About one in five American adults smokes—a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004.

NRT makers offer different dosages for heavy and light smokers, and recommend that the frequency of use decline over time, for instance, from a piece of gum every hour or two in the first six weeks of quitting to every four to eight hours in weeks 10 through 12.

Glaxo products—which include Nicorette gum and lozenges and NicoDerm patches—account for more than half of the $835 million market in annual U.S. retail sales of over-the-counter smoking-cessation aids, according to market-research firm Euromonitor International. Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG also market NRT.

Those skeptical of any move to eliminate warnings on long-term NRT use note that many public-health officials and anti-tobacco agencies have received funding from NRT's makers. ""There's no money to be made in cold turkey quitting, even though cold turkey is how the vast majority of former smokers kicked the habit,"" says John Polito, editor of WhyQuit, a popular blog that endorses cold-turkey cessation from tobacco.

The FDA has faced increasing pressure in recent years to loosen its rules on quit-smoking aids. Some public-health groups have filed petitions with the agency urging changes.

Another impetus is the landmark 2009 law signed by President Barack Obama that, for the first time, empowered the FDA to regulate tobacco products. The law, which is partly aimed at reducing smoking's toll on the nation's health, instructs the agency to consider rewriting the warnings on nicotine-replacement products, which range from eight to 12 weeks, depending on the type.

The warnings date back to when nicotine gum first received FDA approval back in 1984. They weren't based on hard science connecting health hazards to long-term nicotine addiction, but were set to mirror the length of use in clinical trials.

Britain's Royal College of Physicians, which sets health standards in the U.K., concluded in a 2007 report on nicotine addiction that ""medicinal nicotine is a very safe drug"" and ""there are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects on health.""

Many other countries have less-stringent policies on NRT. Canada, Germany, Japan and the U.K. have approved recommended-use periods of anywhere from six to 12 months.

A few studies have examined the use of NRT beyond the current recommendations. Last year, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania published a study in Annals of Internal Medicine that found that smokers who use a nicotine patch for 24 weeks may be more likely to stay off cigarettes than those treated for eight weeks.

However, the study reported no difference in the quit rates of the two groups when they were checked at the one-year mark, revealing the fact that many people began smoking again. The senior author of the study, funded by federal grants, has served as a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline.

Barbara Gregg says that without nicotine gum she likely would have returned to smoking. Ms. Gregg, a 41-year-old executive assistant in the University of Minnesota's department of medicine, smoked for 22 years before she quit by going cold-turkey in 2007. She started chewing the gum about six months later, after experiencing nicotine cravings.

In 2009, before the start of her mother's funeral, she kept her father company as he smoked a cigarette in the parking lot.

""I can guarantee you that if I didn't have nicotine gum with me, I absolutely would have bummed a cigarette off my dad and picked back up again,"" she says.

MONDAY, Feb. 28, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may be able to avoid the accompanying muscle loss and malnutrition by taking fish oil supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids, new research suggests.

The finding is based on a small study involving just 40 lung cancer patients. Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss.

""Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,"" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. ""This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition.""

Mazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer.

To explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA).

While these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil.

The results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight.

What's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains.

Specifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass.

Total fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed.

The authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss.

Lona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings.

""Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,"" she noted. ""Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores. And then with chemotherapy, there is some inflammation that's detrimental to the heart and muscle, as it can cause muscle breakdown. And preservation of lean muscle tissue, we know, leads to better outcomes.""

""So certainly this does seem to be promising,"" Sandon said. ""And other similar studies have looked at omega-3 and muscle preservation and have also suggested that fish oil can act to prevent inflammation caused by both disease and hardcore medications, like chemotherapy agents.""

""But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot,"" she added. ""Much much more than any recommended dietary allowance, along the lines of two to three servings of fish per week.""

But, she said, ""I would say this is certainly worthy of continuing research and exploration. But meanwhile, people should definitely not go out and start consuming huge amounts of fish oil.""

TUESDAY, Feb. 22, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- By analyzing patterns in the brain's electrical activity, researchers say they've been able to assess autism risk in children as young as 6 months of age.

Researchers hooked up 79 babies aged 6 to 24 months to an EEG, or electroencephalogram, which records electrical activity in the brain. Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism.

Children who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children's Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder.

While the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained.

When the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy.

""In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,"" Bosl said.

When broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant.

At six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn't do the same for boys that young.

""It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,"" Bosl said.

The study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine.

EEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics.

But it's the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said.

""Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,"" Bosl said. ""One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it's very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called 'normal' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle.""

EEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said.

""My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,"" Bosl said. ""That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don't know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be.""

Dr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated.

Also, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted.

""If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,"" Ewen said. ""Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.""

"Feb. 17, 2011 (Orlando, Fla.) -- Taking a pomegranate pill a day may help slow the progression of prostate cancer, preliminary research suggests.

The study is the latest to demonstrate pomegranate's promising antitumor effects, says study head Michael Carducci, MD, professor of oncology and urology at Johns Hopkins Medical Institutes.

In 2009, other researchers reported that pomegranate juice may also prevent prostate cancer from getting worse.

The new study involved 92 men with cancer that had not spread beyond the prostate and rising PSA levels. Rising levels of PSA (prostate-specific antigen) are a sign that prostate cancer may be getting worse.

The men took either one capsule containing 1 gram of pomegranate extract or three pomegranate capsules daily.

At the start of the study, the men's PSA levels were doubling every 12 months. After six months of taking the capsules, it took 19 months for their PSA levels to double.

""The results were similar regardless of whether the men took one capsule or three,"" Carducci tells WebMD.

However, men who took three pills daily were more likely to suffer mild to moderate diarrhea: 14% vs. 2% of those who took one pill.

Carducci credits antioxidants in the pomegranate for its anticancer effect.

The study was presented at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium.",1

TUESDAY, Feb. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Men who have a low prostate-specific antigen (PSA) score when they're first tested may not need to be screened annually and probably don't need to undergo a biopsy, a new study suggests.

Dutch researchers presenting the findings at the Genitourinary Cancers Symposium in Orlando, Fla., said that few men with a PSA below 3.0 ng/ml were likely to develop prostate cancer and die of the disease.

""PSA can identify those at low risk of prostate cancer and once you have done that, you can remove almost 50 percent of men in the age group 55 to 74 [from undergoing biopsies],"" said study senior author Monique Roobol, an epidemiologist in the department of urology at Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam.

For this study, about 20,000 men aged 55 to 74 in the Rotterdam area were screened, with those having PSA scores at or above the cut-off of 3.0 sent for biopsies and additional screenings every four years. Eighty percent of men in the group had PSA levels below that threshold.

In this group of men, the higher the PSA level at baseline, the more likely the person was to develop prostate cancer and to die of the disease. Only 1.8 percent of men with PSA scores below 1.0 were diagnosed with prostate cancer, with only 0.04 percent dying of the disease. This compares with 15.7 percent of those with scores from 2 percent to 2.9 percent developing a malignancy and 0.36 percent dying of the disease.

""This gives us some confidence that annual PSA screening is going to soon become a thing of the past,"" said Dr. Nicholas J. Vogelzang, chair of the Developmental Therapeutics Committee of US Oncology, who moderated the teleconference. ""A low PSA, particularly those in men who have less than 1.0, and probably those less than 2.0, certainly could be considered for substantially longer intervals of PSA screening... Personalization of PSA screening is clearly underway.""

A second study also being presented at the symposium found that a drug already used to treat enlarged prostate gland may delay the progression of low-risk, early prostate cancer among men who choose a wait-and-see approach to treatment.

In comparison to men with low-risk, early-stage prostate cancer who took a placebo, ""men randomized to receive Avodart saw their chance of progression significantly reduced, by approximately 40 percent,"" said study author Dr. Neil Fleshner, head of urology at the University Health Network and Love Chair in Prostate Cancer Prevention at Princess Margaret Hospital, both in Toronto. ""Men with low-risk prostate cancer who want to have a period of observation should consider using this drug.""

But the maker of Avodart (dutasteride), GlaxoSmithKline, is unlikely to apply for new approval to market the drug for what is essentially prevention, meaning it would be used off-label in this context, he added.

A final study of almost 4,000 patients found that surgeons needed to perform 1,600 procedures known as robotic-assisted laparoscopic radical prostatectomies (RALP) to become adept at the procedure. In comparison with typical laparoscopic surgery, RALP offers surgeons three-dimensional vision and such improvements as better magnification and hand tremor filtering.

""We recommend that this operation should not be done by all urologists in small community hospitals but should be focused and concentrated on high volume centers of excellence... in order to achieve best possible results for patients,"" said study author Dr. Prasanna Sooriakumaran, a visiting fellow in urology at the Weill Cornell Medical College in New York.

""The procedure is not as easy as manufacturers make it out to be, and enthusiasm in the U.S. needs to be tempered in terms of which hospitals should be buying the equipment and which surgeons should be doing these sorts of operations,"" he added.

One caution, though, is that the study only looked at three surgeons performing RALP.

"Feb. 15, 2011 -- Taking zinc, either as a syrup or lozenge, through the first few days of a cold may shorten the misery of an upper respiratory infection, a new research review shows.

The review also found that zinc cut the number of days that kids missed school because of being sick and reduced the use of antibiotics by cold sufferers. It also appeared to prevent colds in people who used it over the course of about five months.

“This is great news,” says Kay Dickersin, PhD, an epidemiologist with the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health and director of the U.S. Cochrane Center. “We really don’t have interventions for colds that work.”

The review of 15 studies with 1,360 participants was published by the Cochrane group, an international collaboration of researchers that reviews evidence behind therapeutic interventions. It updates a 1999 Cochrane review that found no strong evidence to recommend zinc as a help for colds.

“The evidence from the recent trials does support the use of zinc lozenges in treatment of common cold,” says study researcher Meenu Singh, MD, a pediatric pulmonologist at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Research in Chandigarh, India.",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new look at the medical evidence shows zinc supplements may take the edge off the common cold.

But not a whole lot.

Although the precise estimate is still uncertain, researchers found that people who started taking zinc-loaded lozenges or syrups within 24 hours of showing symptoms — a sore throat, say, or runny nose — shortened their cold by one day. By comparison, a normal cold lasts about a week.

Still, with an infection that currently has no good treatment and leads to an estimated 275 million lost work days a year in the U.S., well, what a difference a day makes.

The review, published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research, also shows that people taking the supplements tended to have milder symptoms.

“I think one can give it a try,” said Dr. Meenu Singh, a pediatrician at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India, who led the new work.

“But giving zinc over a long period of time for prevention should be done very carefully,” she told Reuters Health.

Zinc may interfere with other metals in the body, and that may have unpredictable consequences over the long haul, Singh said.

An earlier Cochrane review from 1999 didn’t find any signs that zinc supplements would work. But since then several new studies - known as randomized controlled trials - have been completed.

The new review is based on 13 trials with 966 participants who either took zinc or a dummy treatment at the beginning of their symptoms. Another two trials found that zinc helped stave off colds, but the quality of that research was low.

The bottom line: After seven days of treatment, those taking the supplements had less than half the chance of still being sick.

A typical adult has a few colds every year. While the episodes usually aren’t serious, the resulting visits to the doctor alone cost the U.S. an annual $7.7 billion, according to the new report.

Singh said the side effects of zinc lozenges, which can be bought for a few dollars in any drug store in the U.S., come down to bad taste and some cases of nausea.

The researchers did not study nasal zinc remedies, however.

In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Matrixx Initiatives to stop selling its widely used supplement Zicam after more than 130 users reportedly lost their sense of smell.

Singh said there was no evidence of a similar danger from the lozenges or syrups.

Exactly how well zinc works is a matter of future research, and the one day estimate may well change, the researchers note. They add it is currently unclear what dose and particular formulation of the supplement will be most helpful.

TUESDAY, Feb. 15, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- People who take drugs called bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss may also reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by almost 60 percent compared to those not on the drugs, a new study suggests.

Bisphosphonates include such common drugs as Fosamax (alendronate), Boniva (ibandronate), Actonel (risedronate) and Reclast (zoledronic acid). These drugs work by increasing bone thickness, thereby reducing the risk of fractures, the researchers said.

In prior studies, bisphosphonates have already been shown to be associated with a reduced odds for breast cancer.

""These [new] findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers,"" said lead researcher Dr. Gad Rennert, from the Technion-Israel Institute of Technology Faculty of Medicine and chairman of the department of community medicine and epidemiology at the Carmel Medical Center of Clalit Health Services in Haifa, Israel.

""This is [similar] to the effect that we and others have shown for [cholesterol-lowering] statins,"" he said, noting that ""bisphosphonates and statins share the same metabolic pathway.""

The results of the U.S. National Cancer Institute-supported study are published in the Feb. 14 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology.

For the study, Rennert's team collected data on almost 1,900 postmenopausal women who took part in the Molecular Epidemiology of Colorectal Cancer study, which is a population-based trial in northern Israel.

The researchers found that taking bisphosphonates, mostly Fosamax, for at least a year was associated with a significant 59 percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer.

""The magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study; however, it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors,"" Rennert said.

They took into account factors such as family history, ethnic background, diet, physical activity, weight, vitamin D consumption and the use of other drugs such as aspirin, statins and hormone replacement therapy.

The findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer, but they cannot confirm a causal effect -- that is, the study doesn't prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer.

However, the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body, which is similar to how cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins work, according to Rennert. These same researchers also found in another study that statin use also reduced the risk of colorectal cancer, he noted.

""We also found a similar effect last year with risk of breast cancer, which has already been replicated by three other groups,"" Rennert added.

A randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer, Rennert said. ""It should be relatively easy, as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect,"" he said.

The researchers noted, however, that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility, in rare cases, of osteonecrosis of the jaw (destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue). Bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh, according to the U.S. Food and Drug Administration.

""The adverse effects profile is of major importance if bisphosphonates are going to be recommended for cancer prevention in healthy people,"" the study authors cautioned.

Commenting on the study, Eric Jacobs, Strategic Director of Pharmacoepidemiology at the American Cancer Society, said that ""the lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing.""

However, these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies, he said. ""Results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer, a recent large study from the United Kingdom, do not support an important protective effect,"" Jacobs noted.

Fortunately, there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal cancer, he said. ""In particular, all Americans, 50 or older, should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer.""

"Parkinson’s disease is a progressive neurological disease that causes symptoms including muscle tremors, shaking, and stiffness. The cause of the disease is unknown, and the risk of developing it increases with age.

""This is the first study in humans to examine the association between flavonoids and risk of developing Parkinson's disease ,"" says researcher Xiang Gao, MD, PhD, of the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston, in a news release. ""Our findings suggest that flavonoids, specifically a group called anthocyanins, may have neuroprotective effects. If confirmed, flavonoids may be a natural and healthy way to reduce your risk of developing Parkinson's disease .""

A new study shows men who ate the most foods rich in a group of antioxidants known as flavonoids were 35% less likely to develop Parkinson’s disease than those who ate the least. Major dietary sources of flavonoids include berries, apples, tea, red wine, chocolate , and citrus fruits.

Feb. 14, 2011 -- Incorporating berries and other fruits in your diet may pay off by reducing the risk of Parkinson’s disease.

Berries Blunt Parkinson’s Disease Risk

The study, to be presented in April at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in Honolulu, looked at the relationship between flavonoid intake and Parkinson’s disease in 49,281 men who participated in the Health Professional Follow-up Study and 80,336 women who participated in the Nurses’ Health Study.

The participants were followed for 20-22 years and filled out questionnaires about the foods they ate.

Researchers calculated total flavonoid intake based on the participants’ consumption of five flavonoid-rich foods included on the questionnaires: tea, berries, apples, red wine, and oranges/orange juice.

The results showed that men who ate the most foods rich in flavonoids had a 35% lower risk of Parkinson’s disease compared with those who ate the least. No link between overall flavonoid consumption and Parkinson’s disease risk was found in women.

But when researchers looked at specific sub-groups of flavonoids, they found both men and women who ate the most foods rich in anthocyanins, which are found primarily in berries and apples, had a 22% lower risk of Parkinson’s disease compared to those who ate the least.

The study doesn’t prove that berries (or flavonoids in any other food) prevent Parkinson’s disease. This was an observational study and therefore can’t establish cause and effect. Nor is it clear why the results differed for men and women.

This study will be presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the ""peer review"" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.",0
"Feb. 10, 2011 (Los Angeles) -- Giving clot-busting drugs to people with mild strokes could prevent more than 2,000 of them from becoming disabled each year, researchers say.

A stroke occurs when a clot cuts off blood flow to parts of the brain. Those parts of the brain soon start to die. A drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) dissolves clots and restores blood flow.

Mild strokes -- characterized by such symptoms as clumsiness in the hand, weakness of an extremity, some slurred speech, temporary loss of vision, and/or dizziness -- account for more than half of strokes in the U.S.

But people with mild strokes are typically denied tPA because the studies that established its effectiveness excluded mild cases, says Pooja Khatri, MD, of the University of Cincinnati.

It's been assumed that people with mild strokes ""generally [do] well and the risk of tPA treatment, which includes a slight but significant risk of life-threatening bleeding in the brain, would not be worth the benefit,"" she says.

In fact, one in three people who suffer a mild stroke are disabled three months later, Khatri says.",1
"London, England (CNN) -- Researchers hope a new treatment developed in the United Kingdom will prove vital in controlling future flu pandemics such as H1N1 (swine) flu, bird flu as well as ending the need for annual flu jabs.

Developed by scientists at Oxford University, the new vaccine works by targeting protein cells inside the influenza A virus, instead of current vaccines that attack proteins on the outside of the flu virus.

According to Sarah Gilbert, head of the project at Oxford's Jenner Institute, this method is effective because proteins inside the virus are far more similar across all the influenza strains and are less likely to mutate.

In the first successful trial on humans, 11 healthy people were vaccinated and infected with the seasonal flu strain along with 11 non-vaccinated volunteers.

The results, say Gilbert, are important in developing a new form of protection that researchers hope could spell the end of flu vaccination supply problems.

The most recent global pandemic was the 2009 H1N1 flu pandemic, in which the estimates of deaths ranged as high as 12,500 in the U.S. alone, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention.



Gilbert explained: ""With the swine flu pandemic it took four months before the first doses of the vaccine were available and there was only a small amount available,"" Gilbert explained. ""It took a further six months before it was possible to vaccinate a large number of people.

""With this type of vaccine, you would at least be able to start using the vaccine as soon as you knew a new pandemic was starting. You could stockpile the vaccine and wouldn't have this wait to make a new pandemic-specific vaccine,"" she said.

The vaccine would be an important step in treating seasonal flu, not just pandemics.

""Flu kills every year. It's not just swine flu. Normally it's the very old or very young that die from flu, but every year there are deaths from influenza A,"" said Gilbert.

In the U.S alone it's believed about 36,000 people die from seasonal flu-related causes in an average year, according to the CDC.

The initial results are positive, says Peter Palese, professor and chair of microbiology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine, New York, but more research is needed before the new treatment is approved.

""I think it's a very interesting and very elegant approach and the data so far looks very, very good,"" he said.

""But although the vaccine has been give to humans, unfortunately there is no evidence presented to say if it really results in protection against infection.""

Gilbert agrees more work is required before the vaccine becomes available, estimating a wait of at least five year, but says the results are a fundamental next step in the treatment of flu.

""It's fairly certain flu vaccines are going to change a lot in the next few years,"" she said.

""Whether it's this vaccine or another one someone else develops, I don't think we'll be continuing with the type of flu vaccines that we have at the moment.""",1
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Women derive twice the benefit from a device to treat heart failure as men, U.S. researchers said on Monday, underscoring the different ways in which men and women experience heart disease.

Women treated with a combination pacemaker and defibrillator device had a 70 percent reduction in heart failure compared with a 35 percent decline in men, they said.

“Our finding was unexpected, but extremely important because this is the only heart treatment that is clearly better in women than men,” Dr. Arthur Moss of the University of Rochester Medical Center, whose study appears in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, said in a statement.

The findings come from a large Boston Scientific study of cardiac resynchronization therapy known as MADIT-CRT, in which a pacemaker is used to restore normal coordinated heart beats in people whose damaged hearts are less efficient at pumping blood.

The device also included a defibrillator used to shock dangerous heart beats back into normal rhythm.

The original study, published in 2009 in the New England Journal of Medicine, showed patients fared better with a combination cardiac resynchronization therapy and a defibrillator rather than a defibrillator alone.

But it also suggested that women benefited more from resynchronization therapy than men. In the latest study, Moss and colleagues explore how much better women did, and why.

“We found there was a dramatic reduction not only in heart failure events, but a very dramatic reduction in death from any cause,” Moss said in a telephone interview.

“This was far greater than expected. Men got a good result but women got a fantastic result,” he said.

“We think this is the first (study) to show this.”

Moss said women have often been overlooked in studies of heart disease, which until recently were dominated by men.

Other studies have shown heart attack symptoms are much different in women than in men, something that has been publicized with the American Heart Association’s “Go Red for Women” campaign.

In the MADIT-CRT trial, women were more likely to suffer heart failure caused by a viral infection of the heart, whereas in men, the condition is more often caused by blocked heart arteries, Moss said.

Women are also more likely to experience a condition known as left bundle branch block, a pattern of disorganized electrical impulses that responds well when the left side of the heart is treated with a pacemaker.

Women tend to have smaller hearts than men and Moss said the treatment works better in smaller hearts.

Boston Scientific’s device was originally approved to treat severe heart failure, but last September, U.S. regulators extended the approval to patients with mild heart failure.

In November, Medtronic Inc showed its heart failure device helped mild heart failure and its study also suggested women benefited more than men.

Currently, 42 million American women are living with heart disease. It is the leading killer of women in the United States, claiming more women each year than men.",1

Researchers found the antioxidant activity of dark chocolate and cocoa powder was equivalent to or higher than that found in some other so-called “super fruit"" powders or juices, including acai berry, blueberry, cranberry, and pomegranate.

Antioxidants are a group of compounds known to fight the damaging effects of oxidative stress on cells within the body and are increasingly thought to have many heart-healthy properties.

Two groups of antioxidants in particular, polyphenols and flavonols, which are found in various fruits and seeds, have been the focus of much research due to their potentially healthy effects.

MONDAY, Feb. 7, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Feeding children lots of fatty, sugary and processed foods may lower their IQ, while a diet rich in vitamins and nutrients appears to boost it, British researchers say.

This is particularly true during the first three years of life when the brain is developing rapidly, the study authors explained. They speculate that good nutrition may promote brain growth and cognitive development.

""We have found some evidence to suggest that a diet associated with increasing consumption of foods that are high in fat, sugar and processed foods in early childhood is associated with small reductions in IQ in later childhood,"" said lead researcher Kate Northstone, a research fellow in the department of social medicine at the University of Bristol.

A more health-conscious diet was associated with small increases in IQ, she said.

Children should be encouraged to eat healthy foods from an early age, she said. ""We know this is important for physical growth and development, but it may also be important for mental ability,"" she added.

For the study, published online Feb. 7 in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health, Northstone's team collected data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children on 3,966 children born in 1991 and 1992.

The children's parents had answered questions about their kids' diets at age 3, 4, 7 and 8.5 years. The children's IQs were measured using the standard Wechsler Intelligence Scale for Children when they were 8.5 years old.

The researchers identified three basic diets: ""processed,"" crammed with fats, sugar and convenience foods; a ""traditional"" diet high in meats and vegetables; and a ""health conscious"" diet with lots of fruit, vegetables, salads, fish, rice and pasta.

Children who ate a diet high in processed foods at age 3 had a lower IQ at 8.5 years than kids with a healthy diet. For every one point increase in processed foods consumption, they lost 1.67 points in IQ. Conversely, every one point increase in healthy eating translated into a 1.2 point increase in IQ, the researchers found.

The key seemed to be the diet at age 3, since diet at 4 and 7 seemed to have no effect on IQ, the research team noted. However, to truly understand the effect of diet on children's intelligence, further studies are needed, they said.

Commenting on the study, Samantha Heller, a dietitian, nutritionist and exercise physiologist in Fairfield, Conn., said that ""most of us do not realize that the foods we eat have direct consequences on brain growth, function and performance.""

When a child's diet consists primarily of high-calorie foods that are low in the nutrients they need (such as healthy fats, vitamins and minerals), their brains don't get the compounds necessary to develop and function properly, Heller said. ""This can have a series of deleterious effects, including decreased cognitive ability, poor behavior and social skills,"" she said.

""Fast and junk food seem like an easy and affordable option for busy parents, but defaulting to high-fat, high-sugar, high-calorie foods is putting their children's health and future at risk,"" Heller said.

Cooking easy, healthy meals for the family will give ""children's brains a boost in essential nutrients needed for healthy development and improved cognitive skills,"" she added.

THURSDAY, Feb. 3, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A special restrictive diet may significantly reduce symptoms of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in young children, a new study suggests.

When children between the ages of 4 and 8 were placed on a diet containing no processed foods for five weeks, ADHD symptoms diminished in 78 percent of them. And, when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet, two-thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms.

""A strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether ADHD is induced by food,"" wrote the study authors. ""We think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with ADHD, provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five-week period, and provided expert supervision is available,"" they concluded.

Results of the study are published in the Feb. 5 issue of The Lancet.

ADHD is a common childhood disorder, according to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH). Children with ADHD have trouble paying attention, focusing and can be hyperactive. Parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms, but there's not a lot of evidence to support this theory, according to the NIMH. However, food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children's behavior, though the evidence isn't yet conclusive.

Since some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods -- such as eczema, asthma and gastrointestinal problems -- that affect different organ systems, it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior, according to information in the study.

To test this theory, the researchers recruited 100 children from Belgium and the Netherlands. The children were between the ages of 4 and 8, and all had been diagnosed with ADHD. Most of the children were boys.

The children were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet, and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating.

The restrictive diet began with a diet called the ""few foods diet,"" which includes just rice, meat, vegetables, pears and water. The researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods, such as potatoes, fruits and wheat. The restrictive diet lasted for five weeks.

During the next four weeks, kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets, in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet. The researchers selected foods that were considered both low- and high-IgG foods.

IgG is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities; however, IgG testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths, according to background information in the study.

Some complementary medicine practices test for IgG and recommend eliminating foods high in IgG, explained Dr. Jaswinder Ghuman, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal.

Forty-one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet. Of those, 78 percent had a reduction in their ADHD symptoms, compared with no improvement in the controls. Nine children (22 percent) didn't respond to the diet. On an ADHD symptom scale that ranges from 0 to 72 points, with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms, the average reduction was 24 points, according to the study.

Thirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test. Nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test. What's more, it didn't appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low- or high-IgG food.

""Measuring IgG levels in kids doesn't seem helpful,"" Ghuman said, but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children.

""If parents have noticed that a child's behavior seems to get worse with certain foods, it may be worth considering,"" said Ghuman, who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

""But, for this diet to work, you have to be very consistent with it, and you have to pay attention to nutrition. It should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor, and if possible, a dietician,"" she advised.

Ghuman said that this study doesn't answer a number of questions, such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long-term. And, she added, that clinical practice shouldn't be changed based on the results of one study.

Dr. Andrew Adesman, chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the Steven and Alexandra Cohen Children's Medical Center of New York in New Hyde Park, echoed Ghuman's concerns.

""Since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks, it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit,"" he said, adding, ""Since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children, this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with ADHD.""

Adesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with ADHD, not to children who had ADD without the hyperactivity component.

"Feb. 3, 2011 -- Children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) should be offered a special ADHD diet to see if eliminating certain foods might reduce their symptoms, Dutch researchers say.

The diet studied, known as the restricted elimination diet (RED), can work, the researchers say, because they believe ADHD symptoms in some children might be affected by eating specific foods.

''I am of the opinion that every child deserves this diagnostic intervention,"" researcher Lidy Pelsser, PhD, of the ADHD Research Centre in Eindhoven, the Netherlands, tells WebMD.

In the study, published in The Lancet, 78% of children who stuck with the diet did respond by having fewer symptoms.

In five weeks of trying the diet, Pelsser says, parents will know if their child is responding or not; if not, they can move on to other treatments.

U.S. experts had some caveats, saying that the results of the study, which included 100 children, should be repeated in other populations to see if the findings hold up.",1
"Feb. 2, 2011 -- The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine can help stave off genital warts in boys and men, according to a new study in the Feb. 3 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

Of 4,065 boys and men aged 16 to 26 from 18 countries, vaccination with an HPV vaccine that targets four types of HPV infection -- HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18 -- protects against infection with these types of HPV and potentially the development of related external genital warts or lesions.

HPV, a sexually transmitted disease, can be transmitted through vaginal, anal, and oral sex and has been linked to genital warts as well as cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oral, penile, and anal cancers.

Two HPV vaccines are now approved by the FDA: Cervarix and Gardasil. Both of these vaccines are recommended to prevent cervical cancers. These vaccines are now on the CDC’s routine childhood vaccine schedule for girls starting at age 9.

The Gardasil vaccine has also received FDA approval for prevention of genital warts. The vaccine is recommended for optional use in boys and men. The vaccine is used in girls and boys and young adults ages 9 to 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11.

“The most salient message is that the [Gardasil] vaccine can prevent HPV infection on the external genital region, which means that we can now prevent most cases of genital warts if the boy is vaccinated at a sufficiently early age,” says study researcher Joel Palefsky, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.",1

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 2, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A large international trial finds that the Gardasil vaccine shields young men from human papillomavirus (HPV) as well as it protects young women.

HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women, but also has been linked to penile cancer and other malignancies in men.

According to a study in the Feb. 3 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, which was funded by the vaccine's maker, Merck & Co., Gardasil was 90 percent effective in older teenaged boys and young men.

""Studies like this underscore the 'human' in human papillomavirus,"" said Fred Wyand, director of the HPV Resource Center at the American Social Health Association. ""This well-designed study reinforces the idea that there is value in vaccinating young men against a virus that is nearly ubiquitous among sexually active individuals.""

Gardasil protects against several strains of HPV, which is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women. It has also been linked to vulvar, anal and throat cancers. Studies have shown it to be about 100 percent effective in preventing precancerous cervical lesions in females.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for girls in 2008 and for boys aged 9 through 26 in 2009. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that 11- and 12-year-old girls begin receiving the vaccine as part of school vaccination efforts, an advisory panel voted against routine use of the vaccine in boys and men.

Uptake of the vaccine, which costs about $390 for the 3-shot regimen, has been far from universal among girls. According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don't start it at all.

But study author Anna Giuliano believes that, ""vaccinating males would have a direct benefit that men would receive, as well as a community benefit. If you reduce infections in men, you're going to reduce transmission to their partners so you have the herd immunity effect.""

HPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm.

This study involved more than 4,000 boys and men aged 16-to-26 from 18 different countries who were randomly assigned to get the vaccine or not. All were HPV-free at the beginning of the trial, and were followed for about three years.

Among participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV.

""It's a similar efficacy to what we've seen in females,"" said Giuliano, who is chair of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa.

The researchers also saw some reduction in the number of precancerous penile lesions, although at this point they said it's impossible to know whether this will result in a lower rate of penile cancers.

""We're going to finally be able to see men benefit from vaccine, as women have, in coming years,"" said Giuliano.

"LONDON (Reuters Life!) - Britain’s leading heart charity launched a 50 million pound ($80 million) research project on Tuesday into the potential of stem cells to regenerate heart tissue and “mend broken hearts”.

Scientists leading the work for the British Heart Foundation (BHF) said they hope that within the next decade they may have experimental drugs in development that would give certain kinds of cells in the heart the ability to regenerate tissue, repair damage and therefore combat heart failure.

The ability of heart tissue to regenerate already occurs in some animals, such as zebrafish, which can regrow portions of their own hearts if they are damaged.

At a briefing in London to launch a “mending broken hearts” fundraising campaign, scientists said research into stem cells and developmental biology may in future make this possible in people too.

“Scientifically, mending human hearts is an achievable goal and we really could make recovering from a heart attack as simple as getting over a broken leg,” said Professor Peter Weissberg, medical director at the BHF.

Scientists in the United States reported last year that they had been able to turn structural heart cells into beating cells by identifying genes that, in a developing embryo, turn an immature cell into a beating heart cell or cardiomyocyte.

One of the British teams, led by Professor Paul Riley of the Institute of Child Health at University College London (UCL) has already found a natural protein, called thymosin beta 4, that plays a role in developing heart tissue.

He said his researchers had already had some success in using this protein to “wake up” cells known as epicardial cells in mice with damaged hearts.

“We hope to find similar molecules or drug-like compounds that might be able to stimulate these cells further,” he told reporters at the briefing.

Another team of researchers at Imperial College London will be looking at a group of rare latent stem cells that can be harvested and then grown in the laboratory.

These cells are highly active in developing hearts and can grow into new functioning tissue, but something in them gets switched off soon after humans are born, meaning that the heart is no longer able to repair any damage, said Professor Michael Schneider, who leads this team.

His researchers will be trying to find ways of re-activating the cells in a controlled and safe way, so that they are able to repair damaged heart tissue but will not grow out of control.

“One strategy would be to give a drug that would activate this kind of process,” he said, adding that this “requires more knowledge about what signals trigger these cells”.

Weissberg said if the research was as successful as they hoped, it could one day reduce or even eliminate the need for heart transplants for patients whose hearts are damaged. (Editing by Steve Addison)",0
"Doctor Challenges Cause Of MS And Treatment

One day 7 years ago, after a long walk with his dog along the Hudson River in Manhattan, Marc Stecker noticed he was limping. Not long after, he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis.

""Fast forward now, and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening,"" Stecker says.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography/Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography

Stecker is now confined to a wheelchair, from where he writes a blog about his disease, called Wheelchair Kamikaze.

More than a year ago, Stecker started writing about a theory Italian physician Paolo Zamboni proposed in 2008 called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency, or CCSVI.

It's been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness, paralysis and death. However, Zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins — leading to inflammation, which, in turn, causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord.

Zamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up. Stecker was hopeful.

""Because my disease is so aggressive, I have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it,"" Stecker says.

The 'Liberation Procedure'

To clear the veins, his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon. Zamboni calls it ""the liberation procedure"" but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it's used to open clogged arteries — not veins.

A Brief History Of Multiple Sclerosis In 1822, Augustus D'Este, the grandson of England's King George III, began documenting his illness, which would one day be identified as multiple sclerosis. Since D'Este's day, researchers have learned how to better treat the disease, but have not yet found a cure. Here is a timeline of some key events along the way.

1868: Scientists identify multiple sclerosis as a distinct condition. 1878: Myelin, which insulates nerve fibers, is discovered. In MS, the body erodes the myelin, which damages nerve fibers and interrupts brain signals. 1916: Using a microscope James Dawson examines the brains of people who died from MS. He is able to describe in depth the damage done by the disease. 1969: Researchers use a hormone typically made by the pituitary gland to treat the symptoms of MS. 1981: The MRI is first used to help diagnose MS, reducing diagnosis time from seven years to six months after the first symptom. 1993: Doctors begin using a drug called Beta interferon 1-b to reduce disease flare-ups. 2008: Paolo Zamboni proposes the theory Chronic Cerebrospinal Venous Insufficiency. — From the National Multiple Sclerosis Society

""At first, I was very skeptical. But anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it.…So, I decided, you know, hey it was worth a shot,"" Stecker says.

But it didn't work. Although the doctor who treated him in New York found a significant blockage, he was unable to correct it, Stecker says.

Still, some would say Stecker was lucky. Many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure, only to have it fail a few months later. Others elect to have tiny metal tubes, known as ""stents,"" placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications, including life-threatening blood clots. Several patients have even died as a result.

Stecker says if he had it to do over again, he would have waited for more research. But he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure.

""CCSVI equals hope and a lot of MS patients just are completely devoid of hope,"" Stecker says. ""People don't want to have MS. They want to go back to who they used to be. You know, along comes this theory that offers an easy-to-understand solution, so it's very, very, very seductive.""

Growing Public Controversy



It's so seductive, in fact, that Canadians and Americans with MS have been flocking overseas to get the ""liberation procedure."" Something that many researchers find very troubling. Robert Zivadinov of the Buffalo Neuroimaging Analysis Center in New York says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients, it is impeding necessary research.

Enlarge this image toggle caption Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography Cleveland Clinic Center for Medical Art & Photography

""Even if the treatment is not useful for patients with MS, I don't think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in MS,"" Zivadinov says. ""And I think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on.""

What is going on is still a bit of a mystery. Critics argue that although Zamboni's original research suggests a vascular cause for MS, other studies don't. These discrepancies, and growing public controversy, prompted the National Multiple Sclerosis Society in the U.S. and the Multiple Sclerosis Society of Canada to take Zamboni's claims seriously. They funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between CCSVI and MS.

Robert Fox, a neurologist at the Cleveland Clinic, currently oversees one of the studies funded by an MS Society grant. He says part of the confusion comes from variations in how CCSVI is measured.

""That's absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies: Are the techs who got negative results, did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that Dr. Zamboni described doing the ultrasound? And that's a very important issue,"" Fox says.

Fox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it's not something most technicians ever do.

'Bigger Than Multiple Sclerosis'

Meanwhile in Buffalo, Zivadinov says his research on CCSVI already shows a clear picture emerging.

""CCSVI is not the cause of MS but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression, and I think that has to be studied,"" Zivadinov says.

Studying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept, Zivadinov says. One that may have an impact beyond any single disease.

""What professor Zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis,"" Zivadinov says. ""We need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging.""

Zamboni himself says that even if it turns out he's wrong, coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward — both for him and thousands of MS patients.",1
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A new analysis of evidence used by a U.S. advisory panel to roll back breast cancer screening guidelines suggests it may have ignored evidence that more frequent mammograms save more lives, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.

Researchers at the University of Colorado and University of Michigan studied some of the same risk models used by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) to issue controversial breast screening guidelines in 2009.

Those guidelines recommended against routine mammograms for women in their 40s and said women in their 50s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year.

In the new analysis, the team found that annual mammograms starting at age 40 save 65,000 more women from breast cancer than mammograms done every other year in women 50 and older.

“It is not a small difference,” said Dr. Mark Helvie of the University of Michigan Health System, who worked on the study published in the February issue of the American Journal of Roentgenology.

His team calculated that a woman who gets a yearly mammogram starting at age 40 cuts her risk of dying from breast cancer by 71 percent compared to a 23 percent reduction in risk if a woman followed the task force recommendations.

When they were issued, the task force’s guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age 40, kicking off a fury of protest among breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation of fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer.

They were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps.

But Helvie and colleague Edward Hendrick of the University of Colorado wrote that “the USPSTF chose to ignore the science available to them and overemphasized the potential harms of screening mammography, to the serious detriment of U.S. women who follow their flawed recommendations.”

Dr. Carol Lee who chairs the American College of Radiology’s Breast Imaging Commission said the new study highlights the risk of setting policy based on the conclusions of one group of scientists.

She said breast mammograms have contributed significantly to reducing deaths from breast cancer, a fact that should not be ignored in favor of mathematical models.

“It’s like a weather man using a computer model to see what the weather is rather than looking outside the window,” Lee said in a telephone interview.

Many groups, including the American Cancer Society, have stuck by their long-standing recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age 40, stressing that the breast X-rays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early, when they are most easily treated.

Breast cancer is the second-leading cause of cancer death among U.S. women, after lung cancer. It kills 500,000 people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to 1.3 million people around the world.",0
"LONDON (Reuters) - British scientists have discovered a “rogue gene” which helps cancer spread around the body and say blocking it with the right kind of drugs could stop many types of the disease in their tracks.

A laboratory researcher in a file photo. REUTERS/File

Researchers from the University of East Anglia said their findings could lead within a decade to the development of new medicines to halt a critical late stage of the disease known as metastasis, when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body.

The culprit gene, called WWP2, is an enzymic bonding agent found inside cancer cells, the researchers explained in their study, published in the journal Oncogene Monday.

It attacks and breaks down a naturally-occurring protein in the body which normally prevents cancer cells from spreading.

In tests in the laboratory, the UEA team found that by blocking WWP2, levels of the natural inhibitor protein were boosted and the cancer cells remained dormant.

Surinder Soond, who worked on the study, said it was a “novel and exciting approach to treating cancer and the spread of tumors which holds great potential.”

“The challenge now is to identify a potent drug that will get inside cancer cells and destroy the activity of the rogue gene,” said Andrew Chantry of UEA’s school of biological sciences, who led the research.

He said this was “a difficult but not impossible task” and one that would be made easier by the better understanding of the biological processes gained in this early research.

Chantry said in a telephone interview the findings mean drugs could be developed in the next 10 years that could be used to halt the aggressive spread of many forms of cancer, including breast cancer, brain, colon and skin cancer.

If a drug was developed that deactivated WWP2, he said, conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy could be used on primary tumors with no risk of the disease taking hold elsewhere.

He said his team is now working with other scientists to try to design a drug which could interrupt the gene’s activity.",1
"Jan. 24, 2011 -- Using electrical pulses to stimulate nerve centers deep within the brain may reduce high blood pressure that can’t be controlled with medication, a case report shows.

Doctors in the U.K. made the discovery after implanting a device that works as an electric stimulator of a region of the brain in a 55-year-old man who had developed chronic pain on the left side of his body following a stroke.

Though his pain eventually returned after four months, his doctors report that their patient’s previously uncontrolled blood pressure has remained normal for nearly three years.

That was a surprise because experts had long thought that pain had to be reduced to see a reduction in blood pressure.

“Pain creates stress and that can have an effect on one’s blood pressure,” says Nikunj J. Patel, MD, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, U.K., and an author of the case study.

Patel says that makes the impact of the case study “startling and exciting” because if studies bear the findings out, deep brain stimulation may one day help people with hypertension whose blood pressure remains uncontrolled on multiple medications.

The case study is published in the Jan. 25 issue of Neurology.

While the case study is only an example of the phenomenon occurring in a single person, previous reports have observed the same kinds of reductions in blood pressure in people getting deep brain stimulation for pain, though researchers had believed that the blood pressure benefit was directly tied to the degree of pain relief the person experienced.

“What their case report shows is that blood pressure can be reduced in a sustained fashion in a patient with unsuccessful deep brain stimulation for pain,” says Erlick Pereira, MD, a neurosurgeon at the University of Oxford. Pereira wrote about blood pressure reductions in a patient getting deep brain stimulation in the January 2010 issue of the Journal of Clinical Neuroscience.

“I think that’s important because it paves the way for potentially studying patients without chronic pain and offering the treatment sometime in the future to reduce blood pressure,” he says.",1

MONDAY, Jan. 24, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors administering deep brain stimulation to control a patient's severe pain report that they discovered the treatment consistently lowered the man's hard-to-control high blood pressure.

The finding introduces the possibility that deep brain stimulation -- a surgical implant that delivers electrical pulses to the brain -- might one day become a treatment for drug-resistant hypertension or lead to clues about the brain's role in regulating blood pressure.

The study is reported in the Jan. 25 print issue of the journal Neurology.

About 10 percent of high blood pressure cases either can't be controlled with medication or patients cannot tolerate them, study author Dr. Nikunj K. Patel, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, England, said in a journal news release.

According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, high blood pressure affects 30 percent of American adults. The condition raises the risk of heart attack and stroke.

""It's a really interesting paper,"" said Dr. Nicholas D. Schiff, director of the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuromodulation at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""I thought it was compelling, though single cases are always questionable"" to generalize.

In the case study, a 55-year-old man was implanted with a deep brain stimulator to treat severe pain stemming from a stroke. Although the patient was taking four drugs to control his high blood pressure, which was diagnosed at the time of his stroke, his blood pressure had remained high.

The man's blood pressure gradually decreased enough for him to stop taking all blood pressure medications, though the deep brain stimulation failed to control his pain long-term. When researchers tested turning off the stimulator after two years, the patient's blood pressure rose significantly.

The study adds to other recent research focused on neuromodulation, which harnesses the power of electrical impulses in the body for therapeutic benefit. Tactics being tested include renal nerve ablation, a procedure that emits low-power radiofrequency along the nerves next to the kidneys, interrupting signals that trigger high blood pressure.

""In the general sense, neuromodulation for blood pressure is really going to be a revolutionary treatment for chronic [high] blood pressure,"" said cardiologist Dr. Marc Penn, director of the Cleveland Clinic's Bakken Heart-Brain Center.

""I think it's really interesting physiology,"" added Penn, noting that the results would need to be repeated multiple times before a therapy based on it could be developed.

Schiff, however, was hesitant to predict that deep brain stimulation might become a common treatment for hard-to-control high blood pressure.

""This is a case report, and not a treatment for anything,"" he said, adding, ""There are risks to this procedure and one has to really look at the tradeoffs.""

"Images of the Hindu goddess Lakshmi often portray her carrying a coconut.

The symbolism has meant something to East Indians for thousands of years. And, increasingly, it resonates for Westerners.

Move over, pomegranate and acai berry. Coconuts are the new “in” food, touted by natural-foods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday.

“It’s a good time to own a coconut farm, that’s for sure,” said Daniel Fabricant, vice president for government and scientific affairs at the Natural Products Association, a trade association in Washington.

Fabricant said companies that belong to his organization, representing natural-foods retailers and manufacturers, are increasingly offering coconut-based products.

“You’ve got fiber, fats and oils, water-based compounds, and you’ve got the milk,” he said. “It’s a holistic approach.”

The fruit’s appeal rests, in part, on this versatility. A single coconut produces water, nectar, flesh, milk and even textile fiber. That translates into a broad slate of products. And in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products — petroleum — coconuts are viewed as healthy.

But are they?

It depends.

Coconut water comes from young, green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes, sodium and potassium.

It is very healthy.

“It’s an effective drink for rehydration that doesn’t bring in the added sugars and the additives,” said Dani Little, dietitian for the Whole Foods Market on Pearl Street in Boulder. “A lot of rehydrating beverages have additives, whereas the coconut water — it’s super clean.”

Coconut oil and milk, though, are receiving mixed reviews.

The facts on fats

Coconut fat is saturated, like the fat in lard and butter. The healthiest fats, those found in olive and canola oils, contain more monounsaturated fats, which do not raise LDL cholesterol and might even help lower it. Doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterol-boosting saturated fats for years. Coconut fats are not an exception.

“I’ve had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that, and their cholesterol has gone up significantly,” said Jessica Crandall, a Denver dietitian who is president of the Colorado Dietetic Association. “Saturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health. I was meeting with a cardiologist recently, and he said he doesn’t advise (coconut oil) for any clients.”

The fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut, versus other saturated fats. While most other saturated fats contain “long- chain” fatty acids, most coconut fats are “medium-chain.”

This is advantageous for coconuts because the medium-chain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes, said Little. In general, she said, fats high in medium-chain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with long-chain acids.

In addition, coconut fats are high in lauric acid, which many believe acts as an antimicrobial, helping prevent viruses, fungi and parasites.

Even so, Little, a coconut enthusiast, doesn’t recommend loading up on coconut fats. Instead of buying oils or supplements, just use the whole coconut.

“What we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything,” she said. “If you focus on coconut oil, you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories. It’s the whole coconut that needs to be talked about.”

The coconut gold rush

Entrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days. Some — those toiling to make money with coconut water — are worried about the coconut supply.

Coconut water “is much different from Red Bull or Vitamin Water,” said John Craven, the founder of Bevnet.com, a trade publication for the beverage industry. “If they want to make more, they just build more factories.”

Craven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market, like iced tea or energy drinks, as something akin to a gold rush.

“Right now, coconut water is all the rage,” he said. “With the natural movement being in the forefront right now, the timing is right. In the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle — electrolytes and hydration.”

Craven estimated the coconut-water market at about $100 million annually right now, but companies are doubling their sales year after year. By next year, he said, one company alone — Vita Coco — could do $100 million or more in sales. He predicted within a few years it will be a billion-dollar market.

Mammoth beverage companies like Coca-Cola, Dr Pepper Snapple Group, and PepsiCo have investments in coconut water. Grocers shelves add new coconut-water products regularly.

“Demand has increased exponentially, primarily in mainstream groceries like Walmart and Costco,” said Arthur Gallego, a spokesman for the New York-based Vita Coco. “It’s trickling down to the mass market.”

The company is growing so quickly, he said, it had to hunt for coconuts from outside of Brazil, where it previously harvested most of its fruit. Now it also gets coconuts from Asia.

“The volume is going through the roof,” said Laura Sauls, a spokeswoman for Hermosa Beach, Calif.-based Zico. “We are seeing new competitors by the week.”

It’s not just the pure water that is exciting marketers. It’s increasingly being used as an additive, too.

Coconut water “is very healthy, and that’s our aim,” said Kevin Conrad, a sales executive with GoFast, a Denver energy drink that now includes a version containing coconut-water concentrate.

It’s healthy — and simple, too. That’s one of the attractions, said Tom Rich, who is in charge of grocery operations for Whole Foods Rocky Mountain region.

“It’s something you don’t have to figure out,” he said. “People know what it is and where it grows. It’s simple all the way around.”

Coconut by the numbers

One tablespoon of coconut oil contains 120 calories and 14 grams of fat, 12.5 grams of which is saturated. A tablespoon of butter, by comparison, contains 102 calories and 11.5 grams of fat; 7.3 of those grams are saturated.

Coconut milk doesn’t pack quite the wallop of oil, but consume it in moderation: a quarter-cup has 240 calories and 14.5 grams of fat, with 12.5 grams of the fat saturated.

One cup of coconut water contains 46 calories, a half-gram of fat , 252 milligrams of sodium and 8.9 grams of carbohydrates.",0

But a new form of pain relief seems to be catching on: analgesics delivered through a medicated patch placed directly where it hurts.

The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the country's first over-the-counter, pain-relieving transdermal patches in 2008. But the patches, marketed under the brand name Salonpas, are nothing new. They've been sold in various countries in Asia since the 1930s, according to their manufacturer, the Japanese firm Hisamitsu Pharmaceutical.

""Salonpas is the Western world catching up with Asia,"" said Dr. Rick Rosenquist, a professor of anesthesia and director of pain medicine at the University of Iowa Carver College of Medicine and chairman of the American Society of Anesthesiologists' committee on pain medicine.

""If you are an Asian kid, you've had these placed on you since time immemorial,"" he said. ""It's just now starting to hit more mainstream in the United States. They're gaining more acceptance.""

Before the FDA action, pain-relieving patches were available in the United States only by prescription, said Dr. John Dombrowski, director of the Washington Pain Center in Washington, D.C. Their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine, capsaicin and non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. The active ingredients in Salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol, common components of pain-relieving gels and creams, such as Bengay.

Pain patches have a number of benefits, Rosenquist and Dombrowski said, not the least of which is convenience. With a patch, you ""put [it] on and forget about it, rather than having to remember to take pills,"" Dombrowski said.

The patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person's pain. This may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills. For instance, some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they're taken with food. ""Obviously, patches get around that,"" he said. ""It's a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be.""

And, because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin, people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills.

On the other hand, people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches, to avoid overdose.

The main downside to pain patches, however, apparently comes from their effect on the skin. Some people may find themselves allergic to either the active ingredient in a patch or the adhesive used to keep the patch on the body.

""You need to pay attention when you put them on, to see if you have any kind of skin reaction to the compounds that are contained in the patch,"" Rosenquist said.

Both doctors said that they expect more over-the-counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of Salonpas continues to grow. Future over-the-counter options, they predicted, could include reduced-dosage versions of the NSAID-delivering patches now available through prescription.

""Success begets success,"" Dombrowski said. ""If this does very well, other drug companies will say, 'I want a piece of this action.'""

"Tired? Depressed? Forgetting things? Who isn't these days?

Those are also symptoms of a deficiency of B12, a key nutrient needed to make red blood cells and DNA and keep the nervous system working right.

Vitamin B12 deficiency is officially considered rare, affecting about 1 in 1,000 Americans, according to a 2005 study. But the incidence rises with age, to about 15% of elderly people. The rate is also much higher among people who don't eat meat or dairy products, people with absorption problems, people taking acid-blocking medications and those with Type 2 diabetes who take the drug Metformin.

""B12 deficiency is much more common than the textbooks and journal articles say it is,"" says Alan Pocinki, an internist in Washington D.C., who routinely tests his patients who fall into those categories. He also notes that since the Metformin connection was discovered only recently, some physicians aren't aware of it. ""They assume that if patients complain of numbness and tingling in the feet, it's a diabetes issue and not a B12 issue.""

Other symptoms of low B12 include anemia, depression, dementia, confusion, loss of appetite and balance problems. Long-term deficiency can bring severe anemia, nerve damage and neurological changes that may be irreversible.

Sometimes the symptoms are subtle. Internist Linda Assatourians, one of Dr. Pocinki's partners, says that a surprising number of her young female patients also have low levels of B12. Typically they are healthy and active, but they don't eat much meat and they have minor mood, memory or balance problems. ""When I supplement their B12, they feel better,"" Dr. Assatourians says. ""It's not a controlled study, but I see a lot of them.""

""I was sort of tired, but I thought, 'It's winter and I'm doing too much,' "" says Jessica Riester, 27, editor of publications for a German-American think tank. Her B12 level was slightly over 200 picograms per milliliter (the normal range is considered 200 to 800 pg per ml). After several weeks of B12 injections, then 1,000 milligrams daily in pill form, her B12 is now over 600 pg per ml and she says she feels better. ""My color is better and the shadows under my eyes are gone,"" she says.

Indeed, several studies have shown that some symptoms of B12 deficiency, particularly early problems with cognitive function, can be apparent even when patients' blood levels are still in the normal range.

How Much Recommended Dietary Allowances for vitamin B12 by age: 0-6 months: 400 nanograms

6-12 months: 500 ng

1-3 years: 900 ng

4-8 years: 1.2 micrograms

9-13 years: 1.8 mcg

14 years and older: 2.4 mcg

Pregnant women: 2.6 mcg

Nursing mothers: 2.8 mcg Source: National Academy of Sciences, 1998

Still, vitamin B12 isn't a miracle pick-me-up, a performance enhancer, a weight-loss aid or a quick way to sober up after a long night of drinking, as some celebrities and Internet marketers claim. For people who aren't deficient, ""there's no evidence whatsoever that these injections are useful to pep you up,"" says Irwin H. Rosenberg, a professor and former dean of the Friedman School of Nutrition at Tufts University. Taking too much B12 is unlikely to be harmful, he adds; the excess is simply excreted.

B12 is one of the newest of the human vitamins, identified in 1948. It originates in bacteria, yeast and microbes in soil. Plants can't store it, so people get their B12 almost exclusively from meat, liver, poultry, fish and dairy products. Adults need just 2.4 micrograms a day, the amount in three ounces of beef, and can generally store it in fat tissue for several years. Dr. Pocinki speculates that some of his very lean patients are B12 deficient because they don't have much fat to store it in.

Some people have trouble absorbing B12 in the first place. Stomach acid is needed to release it from food particles. People who have used acid-blocking medications, particularly proton-pump inhibitors, for years may not have enough. And many elderly people naturally stop making stomach acid, so B12 deficiencies are increasingly common as people age.

Boosting B12 B12 comes almost exclusively from meat, liver, poultry, fish and dairy products. Some breakfast cereals are also fortified with the vitamin. Selected Food Sources of Vitamin B12 Food Micrograms (mcg) per serving Percent DV* Liver, beef, braised, 1 slice 48 800 Clams, cooked, breaded and fried, 3 ounces 34.2 570 Breakfast cereals, fortified with 100% of the DV for vitamin B12, 1 serving 6 100 Trout, rainbow, wild, cooked, 3 ounces 5.4 90 Salmon, sockeye, cooked, 3 ounces 4.9 80 Trout, rainbow, farmed, cooked, 3 ounces 4.2 50 Beef, top sirloin, broiled, 3 ounces 2.4 40 Cheeseburger, double patty and bun, 1 sandwich 1.9 30 Breakfast cereals, fortified with 25% of the DV for vitamin B12, 1 serving 1.5 25 Yogurt, plain, 1 cup 1.4 25 Haddock, cooked, 3 ounces 1.2 20 Tuna, white, 3 ounces 1 15 Milk, 1 cup 0.9 15 Cheese, Swiss, 1 ounce 0.9 15 Beef taco, 1 taco 0.8 13 Ham, cured, roasted, 3 ounces 0.6 10 Egg, large, 1 whole 0.6 10 Chicken, roasted, ½ breast 0.3 6

That's why the Institute of Medicine recommends that people over age 51 get most of their daily requirement from B12 supplements or cereals fortified with the vitamin that break down more easily in the digestive tract.

Further down the digestive tract, B12 must combine with a protein called intrinsic factor to be absorbed into the body. Without intrinsic factor, people absorb much less B12, resulting in a condition called pernicious anemia, in which red blood cells don't develop properly. Left untreated, pernicious anemia can bring on neurological changes, delusions and hallucinations. The discovery that eating large amounts of liver could cure pernicious anemia led to the Nobel Prize for medicine in 1934.

Other conditions can also interfere with B12 absorption, including celiac disease and Crohn's disease. ""I thought I was going to die in my sleep because I had so little energy,"" says Ellen Icochea, a senior executive at the Federal Bureau of Investigation who had a very low B12 level along with several major medical problems. Weekly B12 injections made a dramatic difference. ""It was like, 'Wow, here's energy!' "" she says.

David H. Johnson, a 54-year old wildlife biologist, takes B12 shots every three days to cope with the challenges of chronic fatigue syndrome. ""Imagine you are on a small roller coaster,"" he says. ""You feel up one day and the next and then you start slumping until you're really flat again.""

B12 comes in pill form and a new nasal spray, but injections are the fastest way to correct a severe deficiency, since it does not need to be absorbed in the digestive tract. Many patients learn to inject themselves or have a spouse do it to cut down on doctor visits. ""I have world travelers who take their B12 and needles with them. It's like traveling with insulin,"" says Dr. Pocinki.

He says he has seen low-grade depression lift when patients were given B12 supplements.

Researchers are still investigating possible links between long-term B12 deficiency and other health problems. It's known, for example, that B12 and the other B vitamins help reduce homocysteine, an amino acid in the bloodstream that may be associated with heart disease. But several large prospective studies have not shown that taking B12 supplements reduces the risk.

It's also not clear whether low B12 raises the risk of dementia and Alzheimer's disease, although cognitive impairment brought on by low B12 is sometimes mistaken for Alzheimer's.

""It's really easy to miss, and really easy to fix,"" says Dr. Pocinki.

An additional concern: A high level of folic acid can mask symptoms of B12 deficiency, and many people are getting more folic acid than they realize. Since 1996, all enriched flour must contain folic acid to reduce the risk of neural-tube defects, a severe malformation that occurs in developing fetuses. Some studies suggest that having high folic acid can make cognitive damage from low B12 even worse.

""To this day, we are concerned about the trade-off,"" says Dr. Rosenberg, who was on the advisory panel that recommended enriching flour.

"“We have found many of the same results,” said Dr. Hamill, professor of kinesiology and the director of the university’s biomechanics laboratory. “I guess the main thing to note is that, as biomechanists, we really do not know how orthotics work.”

Orthotists say Dr. Nigg’s sweeping statement does not take into account the benefits their patients perceive.

The key measure of success, said Jeffrey P. Wensman, director of clinical and technical services at the Orthotics and Prosthetics Center at the University of Michigan, is that patients feel better.

“The vast majority of our patients are happier having them than not,” he said about orthotics that are inserted in shoes.

Seamus Kennedy, president and co-owner of Hersco Ortho Labs in New York, said there was an abundance of evidence — hundreds of published papers — that orthotics can treat and prevent “mechanically induced foot problems,” leading to common injuries like knee pain, shinsplints and pain along the bottom of the foot.

“Orthotics do work,” Mr. Kennedy said. “But choosing the right one requires a great deal of care.”

Yet Scott D. Cummings, president of the American Academy of Orthotists and Prosthetists, says the trade is only now moving toward becoming a science. So far, most of the focus in that direction has been on rigorously assessing orthotics and prosthetics for other conditions, like scoliosis, with less work on shoe orthotics for otherwise healthy athletes.

“Anecdotally, we know what designs work and what designs don’t work” for foot orthotics, said Mr. Cummings, who is an orthotist and prosthetist at Next Step in Manchester, N.H. But when it comes to science and rigorous studies, he added, “comparatively, there isn’t a whole lot of evidence out there.”

Dr. Nigg would agree.

In his studies, he found there was no way to predict the effect of a given orthotic. Consider, for example, an insert that pushes the foot away from a pronated position, or rotated excessively outward. You might think it would have the same effect on everyone who pronates, but it does not.

One person might respond by increasing the stress on the outside of the foot, another on the inside. Another might not respond at all, unconsciously correcting the orthotic’s correction.

“That’s the first problem we have,” Dr. Nigg said. “If you do something to a shoe, different people will react differently.”

The next problem is that there may be little agreement among orthotics makers about what sort of insert to prescribe.

In one study discussed in his new book, “Biomechanics of Sport Shoes,” Dr. Nigg sent a talented distance runner to five certified orthotics makers. Each made a different type of insert to “correct” his pronation.

The athlete wore each set of orthotics for three days and then ran 10 kilometers, about 6 miles. He liked two of the orthotics and ran faster with them than with the other three. But the construction of the two he liked was completely different.

Then what, Dr. Nigg asked in series of studies, do orthotics actually do?

They turn out to have little effect on kinematics — the actual movement of the skeleton during a run. But they can have large effects on muscles and joints, often making muscles work as much as 50 percent harder for the same movement and increasing stress on joints by a similar amount.

As for “corrective” orthotics, he says, they do not correct so much as lead to a reduction in muscle strength.

In one recent review of published papers, Dr. Nigg and his colleagues analyzed studies on orthotics and injury prevention. Nearly all published studies, they report, lacked scientific rigor. For example, they did not include groups that, for comparison, did not receive orthotics. Or they discounted people who dropped out of the study, even though dropouts are often those who are not benefiting from a treatment.

Being generous about studies with design flaws that could overstate effects, Dr. Nigg and his colleagues concluded that custom-made orthotics could help prevent and treat plantar fasciitis, a common injury to a tendon at the bottom of the foot, and stress fractures of the tibia, along the shin. They added, though, that the research was inadequate for them to have confidence in those conclusions.

Dr. Nigg also did his own study with 240 Canadian soldiers. Half of them got inserts and the others, for comparison, did not.

Those who got inserts had a choice of six different types that did different things to foot positioning. Each man chose the insert he found most comfortable and wore it for four months. The men selected five of the six inserts with equal frequency.

The findings were somewhat puzzling: While the group that used inserts had about half as many injuries — defined as pain that kept them from exercising for at least half a day — there was no obvious relation between the insert a soldier chose and his biomechanics without it.

That’s why Dr. Nigg says for now it is difficult to figure out which orthotic will help an individual. The only indication seems to be that a comfortable orthotic might be better than none at all, at least for the activities of people in the military.

So where does this leave people like Jason Stallman, my friend and colleague at The New York Times? Jason has perfectly flat feet — no arch. He got his first pair of orthotics at 12 or 13 and has worn orthotics all the time, for walking and running ever since. About a year ago he decided to try going without them in his everyday life; he still wears them when he runs.

Every medical specialist Jason has seen tried to correct his flat feet, but with little agreement on how to do it.

Every new podiatrist or orthopedist, he told me, would invariably look at his orthotics and say: “Oh, these aren’t any good. The lab I use makes much better ones. Your injury is probably linked to these poor-fitting orthotics.”

So he tried different orthotic styles, different materials, different orthotics labs with every new doctor.

That is a typical story, Dr. Nigg says. In fact, he adds, there is no need to “correct” a flat foot. All Jason needs to do is strengthen his foot and ankle muscles and then try running without orthotics.

Dr. Nigg says he always wondered what was wrong with having flat feet. Arches, he explains, are an evolutionary remnant, needed by primates that gripped trees with their feet.

“Since we don’t do that anymore, we don’t really need an arch,” he wrote in an e-mail. “Why would we? For landing — no need. For the stance phase — no need. For the takeoff phase — no need. Thus a flat foot is not something that is bad per se.”

So why shouldn’t Jason — or anyone, for that matter — just go to a store and buy whatever shoe feels good, without worrying about “correcting” a perceived biomechanical defect?

“That is exactly what you should do,” Dr. Nigg replied.",1
"(CNN) -- Taking dietary supplements containing essential fatty acids can help reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome, according to the results of study by researchers at a Brazilian university.

The study, published Monday in the journal Reproductive Health, found that taking capsules containing about 1 gram of a blend of three essential fatty acids produced a significant reduction in PMS symptoms.

Essential fatty acids are substances that are not produced by the human body and are only available from diet. Eggs, nuts, vegetable oils and fish are examples of foods that provide such acids, which are also available in supplement form.

The study, authored by researchers from the Federal University of Pernambuco, is not the first to address the possible link between PMS and essential fatty acids, substances that play a complicated role in a woman's reproductive system. The study cites research dating back to 1983 examining such a possible link.

According to the study, the 120 women who participated reported few side effects, and most of those were mild and may have been due to sensitivity to mineral oil, the placebo taken by some of the participants.

The supplements taken by women in the study contained 210 mg of gamma linolenic acid, 175 mg of oleic acid, 345 mg of linoleic acid, 250 mg of other polyunsaturated acids and 20 mg of vitamin E, according to researchers.

According to the study, women who took the supplements for six months saw a bigger benefit than those who took them for three months.

The researchers do not make any recommendation in their study about whether women who suffer from PMS should increase their intake of essential fatty acids or, instead, consult with their doctor.

Other treatments studied for PMS include vitamin B6, ascorbic acid and niacin.",1
"Antidepressants relieve hot flashes

By Rob Stein

An antidepressant can help alleviate hot flashes that plague many menopausal women, according to new federally funded research.

A study involving 205 women found those taking the antidepressant Lexapro experienced a 47 percent reduction in number of hot flashes they were experiencing and the hot flashes they did have tended to be less severe, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

For years, many women took hormones to alleviate hots flashes. But hormone use plummeted after the federal government's massive Women's Health Initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits.

Since then, many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives. Some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) might be effective.

In the new study, Ellen Freeman of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues gave 205 women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either Lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks. When the study started, the women were having an average of nearly 10 hot flashes each day.

The number of hot flashes among the women taking Lexapro, which is also known as escitalopram, dropped to about five on average after eight weeks--a 47 percent decrease or about 4.6 fewer hot flashes per day, the researchers reported. The severity of the hot flashes also decreased. Among those taking a placebo, the number of hot flashes dropped to 6.43 per day, a 33 percent decrease of 3.2 fewer hot flashes per day. Lexapro seemed to work even among women who were not anxious or depressed.

The hot flashes increased after the women stopped taking the drug but not among those taking a placebo.

Although the benefit was modest, it appeared to be significant enough that women might consider trying it, the researchers said. The study is the first to examine whether there are any racial differences in how well an antidepressant works in alleviating hot flashes. African-American women are more likely than white women to report hot flashes. The study found none.",1
"Studies show that for kids' ear infections, antibiotics work better than waiting

By Jennifer LaRue Huget

Being a parent these days sometimes entails this hypocrisy: Yes, I know overuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that may soon conquer the universe. But please give some to my kid anyway.

Now two new studies (bolstered by an accompanying editorial) in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrate what we parents have suspected for years: When it comes to ear infections, antibiotics are in order.

Current practice guidelines for treating kids' mild middle-ear infections -- or acute otitis media -- call for watchful waiting, to be followed by antibiotics only if symptoms worsen or don't cease. That sounds fine in theory, but it's a tough pill to swallow when it's your own wee one who's wailing and writhing in pain. Ear infections hurt, and waiting for them to run their course can be excruciating.

Both of the studies, in contrast to earlier research on which the ""watchful waiting"" approach has been based, are considered well-designed, even if they are on the small side. Both show that antibiotics are more effective than placebos in relieving ear-infection symptoms such as fever, poor appetite, decreased activity and irritability and suggested that their benefits warrant their being administered early on, regardless of the seeming severity of a child's symptoms. Interestingly, antibiotics were no more effective at reducing pain, as reported by parents or children, than placebos.

One of the studies noted that while antibiotics -- specifically, amoxicillin paired with clavulanate -- shortened the duration of symptoms, half the children on placebo eventually got better without the aid of those drugs. Still, some of the placebo-group kids required ""rescue treatment"" when their symptoms grew markedly worse.

The studies also noted that the use of antibiotics must be weighed against the risk of antimicrobial resistance, to which prescriptions for childhood maladies such as ear infections are thought to contribute mightily, and against antibiotics' side effects, which can include diarrhea and eczema.

As it happens, on Christmas Eve, my daughter (who, at 17, is wee no more) woke up with a wicked pain in her ear. Her doctor took one quick look inside and wrote a prescription for Augmentin, a popular drug that combines amoxicillin with clavulanate potassium. By Christmas morning, the pain had subsided.

Did I feel guilty for potentially contributing to the development of a superbug? The thought never crossed my mind. It doesn't tend to, when you're worried about your kid -- and grateful when her pain goes away.",0
"NEW YORK (Reuters Life!) - The herpes zoster vaccine could prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles each year if it was offered to everyone who is eligible, with vaccinated adults half as likely to develop shingles, a study said.

In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine against shingles — a painful and potentially serious condition — for adults over 60. The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors’ offices.

The study, led by Hung Fu Tseng, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, compared about 75,000 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente Health plan with about 225,000 similarly aged members who weren’t vaccinated.

“We didn’t know how well the vaccine actually performed in the community setting,” Tseng told Reuters Health.

Shingles is a viral disease produced by the chicken pox virus, a common childhood disease, and is characterized by pain and a blistering rash along the nerves that have housed the dormant virus.

Most shingles patients are older adults, but people with a weak immune system or those under stress may also develop it.

Everyone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn’t include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended.

Using electronic health records, researchers tracked patients for up to three years after vaccination.

About six out of every 1,000 people vaccinated got shingles each year, compared to 13 of every 1,000 unvaccinated patients. Researchers calculated that for every 71 people who were vaccinated, one case of shingles was prevented.

But researchers cautioned that because they did not follow patients over the longer term, they didn’t know how effective the vaccine is years later.

Despite the FDA’s approval, the vaccine has not caught on as much as some had hoped.

Cost is one hurdle, with the vaccine sometimes costing up to $200 for people whose insurance doesn’t cover it. It also requires stringent storage and handling.

“The human cost of shingles is enormous,” said Michael Oxman, who studies infectious diseases at the University of California, San Diego, and was involved in a previous study of the vaccine.

“Adult medicine is really geared toward diagnosis and treatment of existing diseases. The adult medical community is not as attuned to preventing disease... as pediatricians are,” he told Reuters Health.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Giving the antidepressant drug Prozac to people who have just had a stroke could help them to regain more control over their movements and allow more of them to live independently, scientists said Monday.

The antidepressant drug Prozac, also known as fluoxetine, are seen on a table in Leicester, central England February 26, 2008 in this posed photograph. REUTERS/Darren Staples

In the largest study yet of the effect of this type of antidepressant on stroke recovery, French researchers found that stroke patients given Prozac improved their scores in motor skills tests more than those given a placebo, or dummy pill.

Experts commenting on the findings said they had “enormous potential to change clinical practice” and raised the question of whether most stroke patients with motor skill problems should be treated with this relatively cheap type of antidepressant.

Stroke is the single largest cause of adult disability and the third-largest cause of death in the developed world.

The cost of caring for its victims, who often have motor function difficulties like paralysis or weakness on one side, puts a heavy burden on already stretched healthcare systems.

A few previous small trials had already suggested that giving drugs like Prozac, which belongs to a drug class known as selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors (SSRIs), might improve motor skill recovery after stroke.

Prozac was developed by Eli Lilly and is now available in a cheaper generic form as fluoxetine.

Hemiplegia — paralysis to one side of the body — and hemiparesis — weakness on one side of the body — are the most common disabilities after stroke and scientists believe SSRIs might help improve movement by increasing the level of the brain chemical serotonin in the central nervous system.

“The positive effect of the drug on motor function... suggests that the neuronal ... action of SSRIs provides a new pathway that should be explored further,” said Francois Chollet of Toulouse University Hospital, who led this research.

In the study, conducted between March 2005 and June 2009 and published in The Lancet Neurology journal Monday, 118 patients in France were given either Prozac or a placebo for three months starting between five and 10 days after they had suffered a stroke.

All patients were also given physiotherapy, and had their motor skills tested at the start of the trial and on day 90.

Significantly greater improvements in motor function were recorded after three months in patients taking Prozac, where the average test score improved by 34.0 points, than in the placebo group, where the average improvement was 24.3 points.

There were also more independent patients and depression was less common in the Prozac group than in the placebo group, and side effects of the drug were rare and mild, researchers said.

Commenting on the study, Robert Robinson and Harold Adams from the University of Iowa in the United States, said it could change the way doctors treat stroke victims in future, but more research is needed to see if the effects continue over time.

Roger Bonomo, director of stroke care at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, said another way to look at the implications of this trial would be as justification for treatment of post-stroke depression before it progresses.

“Depression after stroke is a common enough complication to have raised the question of treating with antidepressants early after stroke,” he said in an emailed comment. “If motor function is also more likely to improve, then treating before symptoms of depression emerge is likely to be even more beneficial.",1
"Jan. 5, 2011 -- A two-week course of the antibiotic rifaximin (Xifaxan) helps to relieve the symptoms of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), and the relief lasts up to 10 weeks after stopping the medication, according to new research.

''The major finding was that all IBS symptoms improved,"" says Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the GI Motility Program at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center, Los Angeles, who led the clinical trial of the drug at Cedars.

The study looked only at those IBS patients with the non-constipation form, he tells WebMD. For those with this type of IBS, symptoms can include abdominal pain, bloating, and changes in bowel function such as diarrhea.

IBS is considered a functional gastrointestinal disorder without a known physiologic cause, with the symptoms recurring and often worsened by stress. Existing treatment options -- diet and lifestyle modification, psychological therapy, and other drugs -- do not help all people with the condition.

With the new antibiotic treatment, Pimentel tells WebMD, many participants ''say they are 80% improved, 90% improved, that kind of results. The stool was more solid, the diarrhea goes away, and the bloating is much less.""

That can translate to big changes in the lives of those with IBS, estimated to affect about 15% of adult Americans. With the drug treatment, Pimentel says, those with the IBS ''can enjoy social outings without the worry of having to run to the bathroom and having diarrhea.""

The drug is approved by the FDA only for traveler's diarrhea and hepatic encephalopathy, a brain disorder caused by chronic liver failure.",1
"Injections of botulinum toxin, best known as a wrinkle treatment, are now being used increasingly to prevent chronic migraine sufferers. Scientific data are mixed, but two large recent studies show Botox can reduce the number of headache days in chronic sufferers.

Migraine headache is a debilitating neurological condition that manifests itself as an intense throbbing pain on one or both sides of the head, according to the Migraine Research Foundation, a New York nonprofit. Some 14 million people experience migraine attacks nearly every day, and attacks typically last from four to 72 hours, according to the foundation. The causes of migraines aren't fully understood, and oral medications—while helpful for some—leave others still suffering, doctors say.

Botulinum toxin is a bacterial protein that scientists say blocks chemicals responsible for muscle contractions and pain. Botox—a form of the toxin sold by Allergan Inc. of Irvine, Calif.—was approved this fall as a migraine treatment by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. It is approved to treat chronic migraine sufferers, defined as people who suffer from headaches on 15 or more days per month with headaches lasting four hours a day or longer.

Tim Foley

Allergan, whose Botox drug is the only botulinum toxin FDA-approved to treat migraines, recommends an injection regime of 31 shots a session in seven separate locations on the head, neck and shoulders. Costs per session range from $1,000 to $1,500 or more, and are sometimes covered by insurance. The shots should be repeated every three months, Allergan says.

""What I tell my patients is that Botox is probably the most well-studied therapy for chronic migraine, and has the best evidence"" of efficacy, says Sheena K. Aurora, director of the Swedish Pain and Headache Center in Seattle and a principal investigator on two recent Allergan-funded studies. Chronic migraine sufferers are a poorly studied patient group, she adds, because their condition is so hard to treat that most pharmaceutical companies exclude them from migraine studies altogether.

Other physicians, such as Joel Saper, director of the Michigan Headache & Neurological Institute in Ann Arbor, who has participated in an Allergan-funded study, are more cautious. Botox ""does not help everybody,"" Dr. Saper says. ""It may not even help most everyone. But it does in my personal anecdotal experience help some people.""

If patients are overusing other medications due to chronic headache pain, he adds, it is important to discontinue those medications before beginning Botox because the medication overuse can actually make the headaches worse. Other physicians say Botox treatments will help patients discontinue medication overuse on their own.

The best evidence so far for Botox's use for migraines comes from two Allergan-funded studies on a combined total of 1,384 patients at 122 study sites across North America and Europe. Compared with injections of salt water, the studies—published online in March in the journal Cephalagia—found that Botox injections reduced the number of days with headaches. In the second study, for example, those treated with Botox had the number of headache days in a 28-day period drop to 11 from 20. Those getting the salt-water treatment saw headache days drop to 13 from 20.

But even those studies had mixed results, with the first study not showing a reduction in the number of headache episodes compared with placebo. Headache episodes are different from headache days because some people have single episodes that last for days, says Mitchell Brin, Allergan's senior vice president, global drug development and an author on both papers. Headache days is a better, more sensitive measure of effectiveness, he adds.

The study subjects included only very severe chronic migraine sufferers. Doctors can legally use Botox to treat people who with less severe migraine history if they like, but ""there is no good evidence"" that it will work, says Dr. Brin. Earlier trials looked at patients who experienced fewer than 15 migraine days a month and didn't find a significant treatment effect, he adds.

It is also legal for doctors to use other forms of botulinum toxin to treat migraines. Other injections may work, scientists say, but ""it's absolutely clear that the data exists for Botox and not the other drugs,"" says David Simpson, a professor of neurology at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York and a consultant to Allergan and several other makers of botulinum toxin.

Side effects from botulinium toxins can include temporary weakness in face muscles, where eyes may not close fully or eyelids droop. In very rare cases, botulinum toxins can weaken muscles throughout the body—causing a lack of bladder control, trouble speaking, swallowing and breathing. Those side effects—while potentially fatal—are very unlikely at the doses used for migraine treatment, Dr. Simpson says.

"In more than 22% of cases, implantable defibrillators are given to heart patients who don't meet the guidelines for receiving the pricey devices, according to a study just published in JAMA.

The research, based on 111,707 cases submitted to a national registry over a three-and-a-half-year period, also finds that those patients who didn't meet the guidelines had a higher risk of dying in the hospital and of complications from the implantation.

ICDs, which can cost north of $30,000, monitor the rhythm of the heart and produce a shock to bring irregular beating back to normal. This study covers primary prevention, or devices implanted in patients who have never had a serious heart-rhythm incident.

""I was surprised -- I expected [the proportion] to be lower,"" Sana Al-Khatib, lead author of the study and a cardiologist at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, tells the Health Blog. Previous research has suggested that the devices are underused in some eligible patients, she says.

Here's the WSJ story on the study. As the paper reports, the study was released early after an embargo break, and shares of device makers seemed to drop as word leaked out. Analysts at Wells Fargo said in a research note that the study could provoke a decline of about 5% in the worldwide ICD market. Medtronic shares were down less than 1% to $37.10 in late trading, while Boston Scientific shares were down 1.5% to $7.49 and St. Jude Medical shares were down 2.9% to $41.06. Read the WSJ story to get perspective from Medtronic and Boston Scientific.

Some of the patients in the study weren't appropriate candidates for an ICD because they'd been excluded from trials -- such as newly diagnosed heart failure patients who are supposed to first try tinkering with medication levels. Other patients weren't considered appropriate because studies showed they weren't likely to benefit from them, for example, patients newly recovering from a heart attack.

The authors emphasize that decisions about ICDs will ultimately come down to the best judgment of the physician and patient. But even if some cases fall into a gray zone where a decision to implant an ICD is not based on evidence but is nonetheless ""reasonable,"" not all of the 22.5% of cases identified in the study likely fit the bill, says Al-Khatib.

In a statement, the Heart Rhythm Society, a professional group for cardiac arrhythmia specialists, says that ""the vast majority of implanting physicians are prescribing ICDs with the confidence that they are providing the best care for their patients."" The group ""encourages research that will further improve the use and effectiveness of ICDs to improve overall quality of care,"" the statement says.

While the characteristics of patients receiving non-evidence-based ICD implants likely contribute to higher rates of in-hospital mortality and complications, those complications are particularly worrisome when there's no likely benefit from the procedure, Al-Khatib says.

The study also finds that electrophysiologists, who specialize in heart-rhythm issues, were less likely to implant ICDs in patients for whom there was no evidence of benefit. (Read: Specialty Matters When Implanting Defibrillators)

""The way I look at this is that it's an opportunity for improvement"" and to see if a ""lack of knowledge or awareness of the guidelines is playing a role,"" says Al-Khatib.

Authors of the study reported receiving funding from Medtronic and other device- and drug makers.

"(CNN) -- Johnson and Johnson will partner with Massachusetts General Hospital to develop and market a blood test that could find a single cancer cell circulating in a person's blood, the company said Monday.

Researchers hope the test will be used by oncologists as a diagnostic tool aimed at discovering as early as possible if a cancer has spread, as well as by researchers in coming up with new drug therapies.

Dr. Mehmet Toner, director of the BioMicroElectroMechanical Systems Resource Center in Massachusetts General's Center for Engineering in Medicine, says while it will take at least five years before the test is on the market, it's another step toward personalized medicine and the implications for patients are significant. ""It is very big. It has the potential to turn cancer into a chronic disease, because we can monitor patients individually and respond with treatment to the genetic makeup of their cancer.""

Toner says the test is like a liquid biopsy and targets almost all solid cancers -- cancers found in ""solid"" organs like the breast or prostate. The cancer cells it finds would be analyzed and their genetic makeup determined, which would be useful in monitoring patients and targeting therapies to the individual.

Veridex, a Johnson and Johnson company, announced the partnership in a statement, saying it involves Ortho Biotech Oncology Research and Development, a unit of Johnson and Johnson Pharmaceutical Research and Development.

""This new technology has the potential to facilitate an easy-to-administer, noninvasive blood test that would allow us to count tumor cells, and to characterize the biology of the cells,"" said Robert McCormack, Veridex's head of technology innovation and strategy. ""Harnessing the information contained in these cells in an in-vitro clinical setting could enable tools to help select treatment and monitor how patients are responding.""

Veridex launched the first commercial test using circulating tumor cell technology in 2004, the company said. It describes circulating tumor cells as cancer cells that have detached from a tumor and are found at very low levels in the bloodstream. Capturing and counting those cells can provide information to patients and doctors about prognoses with certain types of metastatic cancers, the statement said.

""The value of capturing and counting CTCs is evolving as more research data is gathered about the utility of these markers in monitoring disease progression and potentially guiding personalized cancer therapy,"" the Veridex statement said.

Toner said you are likely to find just one circulating tumor cell in 5 to 10 billion blood cells. In fact, a tube of blood taken during an annual exam would only have a few CTCs.

""The challenging goal of sorting extremely rare circulating tumor cells from blood requires continuous technological, biological and clinical innovation to fully explore the utility of these precious cells in clinical oncology,"" Toner said. ""We have developed and continue to develop a broad range of technologies that are evolving what we know about cancer and cancer care.""

The American Cancer Society said the new research is exciting, but it's important to remember it's just another step in the scientific process. ""Researchers have been working on this and similar technologies for some time, and others have predicted a day when we will be able to diagnose cancers before they are otherwise visible by current techniques,"" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, the group's deputy chief medical officer. ""It is appropriate to view announcements such as the one today with enthusiasm, but recognize that we must temper that excitement with the realization that there is still much research to be done to determine the true impact of this test on the treatment of patients with cancer.""

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Children in rural Nepal whose mothers were given iron and folic acid supplements during pregnancy were smarter, more organized and had better fine motor skills than children whose mothers did not get them, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.

They said ensuring that pregnant women get this basic prenatal care could have a big effect on the educational futures of children who live in poor communities where iron deficiency is common.

“Iron is essential for the development of the central nervous system,” said Parul Christian, an expert in international health at the Johns Hopkins University Bloomberg School of Public Health, whose study appears in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Iron deficiency is the most common and widespread nutritional disorder in the world, affecting 2 billion people, according to the World Health Organization.

Early iron deficiency can interfere with nerve development, biochemistry and metabolism, hampering both intellectual and fine motor development.

Christian’s team studied 676 school-age children whose mothers had been in a clinical trial in which some got iron and folic acid supplements and other nutrients while they were pregnant. About 80 percent of the children — aged 7 to 9 — were enrolled in school.

“We had the opportunity to follow the offspring of women who had participated in a randomized trial of iron and folic acid and other micronutrients to assess neurocognitive function and outcomes,” Christian said in a telephone interview.

“What we showed is prenatal iron and folic acid supplementation had a significant impact on the offspring’s intellectual level and motor ability and ability during school age, which was a very exciting finding,” she said.

“It had an impact across a range of function, including intellectual function, executive function and fine motor function,” factors that could affect a child’s later academic success, Christian said.

She said many children in poor communities would benefit from better prenatal programs that include the low-cost nutritional supplements.

“These results speak to a large swath of people residing in that part of the world. Iron and folic acid deficiency are very common,” she said.

The World Health Organization estimates that in developing countries, every other pregnant woman is anemic and about 40 percent of preschool children are anemic.

TUESDAY, Dec. 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- The recreational drug known as ecstasy may have a medicinal role to play in helping people who have trouble connecting to others socially, new research suggests.

In a study involving a small group of healthy people, investigators found that the drug -- also known as MDMA -- prompted heightened feelings of friendliness, playfulness and love, and induced a lowering of the guard that might have therapeutic uses for improving social interactions.

Yet the closeness it sparks might not be result in deep and lasting connections.

The findings ""suggest that MDMA enhances sociability, but does not necessarily increase empathy,"" noted study author Gillinder Bedi, an assistant professor of clinical psychology at Columbia University and a research scientist at the New York State Psychiatric Institute in New York City.

The study, funded by the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse and conducted at the Human Behavioral Pharmacology Laboratory at the University of Chicago, was published in the Dec. 15 issue of Biological Psychiatry.

In July, another study reported that MDMA might be useful in treating post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), based on the drug's apparent boosting of the ability to cope with grief by helping to control fears without numbing people emotionally.

MDMA is part of a family of so-called ""club drugs,"" which are popular with some teens and young at all night dances or ""raves."" These drugs, which are often used in combination with alcohol, have potentially life-threatening effects, according to the U.S. National Institute on Drug Abuse.

The newest study explored the effects of MDMA on 21 healthy volunteers, nine women and 12 men aged 18 to 38. All said they had taken MDMA for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives. They were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of MDMA, methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three-week period.

Each session lasted at least 4.5 hours, or until all effects of the drug had worn off. During that time, participants stayed in a laboratory testing room, and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams.

A moderate dose of MDMA was found to significantly increase feelings of loving, friendliness and playfulness, the researchers said, whereas the low dose of MDMA boosted feelings of loneliness.

The moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people's faces, determined by having the participants look at a range of photos, the study found, but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person's eyes or voice, determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips.

This effect, the Bedi and his team suggested, could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others.

In a twist, the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving. In fact, those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking MDMA.

As a warning, the researchers noted that MDMA might indeed facilitate socializing, but it also might impair a person's perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk-taking.

Nonetheless, the researchers suggested that MDMA might help people with PTSD as well those with autism, schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties.

""More controlled research is needed to establish whether MDMA can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and, if so, what the mechanisms of these effects are,"" Bedi said.

Dr. Michael Mithoefer, author of the earlier study on MDMA and PTSD, also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug.

""First, I think it's very important that we investigate potential new therapies, and that we shouldn't be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused,"" he said. ""Many things can be life-threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly. But if used in the right setting wisely, many things can also be helpful. So there's no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering.""

The results of his earlier study, which had focused on the moderate dose of MDMA, ""were very promising,"" Mithoefer said. ""Now, there's a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness. But it certainly suggests, just as these findings suggest, that the question merits further investigation.""

"Dec. 20, 2010 -- Scientists using brain scanning technologies say they have been able to predict with 90% accuracy which children with dyslexia will be able to improve reading skills over a period of a few years.

Researchers say their findings reveal activity in specific brain regions during reading that could eventually lead to new treatments for people with dyslexia.

“At this time, we cannot say which treatment type will each child benefit from,” study researcher Fumiko Hoeft, MD, PhD, an imaging expert at Stanford University, tells WebMD in an email. “But with more research, and if researchers combine it with intervention studies, then we should be able to identify brain patterns that are predictive of responding to one type of intervention or another.”

She says in a news release that the study “gives us hope that we can identify which children might get better over time” and that the findings represent “a huge step forward.”

The discovery of brain regions involved in the learning disorder “may provide a mechanism for enduring improvement that promotes relatively successful reading development,” according to the study, published in the Dec. 20 issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.",0
"Varicose veins are one of the more unsightly signs of aging. But new, less-invasive treatments are making it easier to remove them painlessly, bypassing a difficult surgical procedure that was often the only option in the past.

As many as 25% of women and 15% of men suffer from varicose veins; over the age of 50, one out of two people are affected. Heredity plays a part, but obesity, prolonged standing on the job and hormone therapy increase the risks. Sometimes, varicose veins have no signs or symptoms and require no treatment, though doctors may recommend wearing compression stockings and elevating the legs. Exercise can also help relieve pain. But often, varicose veins can be disabling and dangerous, as well as a warning sign of more serious problems in the circulatory system.

While vein problems aren't related to artery problems—such as those that can cause heart disease—serious complications of varicose veins can include deep vein thrombosis, a blood clot that can travel to the lungs and cause death, and venous ulcers, shallow wounds that develop on the lower leg and can be hard to heal. Veins near the surface of the skin can also rupture and bleed heavily.

Valve Trouble

Normally, the heart pumps blood filled with nutrients and oxygen to the entire body through the arteries, and then veins carry the blood from the body back up to the heart. The exact cause of varicose veins isn't known, but they develop when one-way valves in the veins that prevent blood from flowing backward stop working properly, so blood pools in the superficial veins under the surface of the skin and causes them to get larger and less elastic.

Darren Schneider, director of the Center for Vascular and Endovascular Surgery at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center, says determining the right treatment depends in large part on the size and location of the veins. Patients typically need an ultrasound study to see if there are any blood clots in the deeper vein system, and to assess the function of the valves.

Smaller veins can often be treated with sclerotherapy, which involves injecting a chemical solution into the vein to destroy it, and costs $250 to $500 per treatment. For larger veins, doctors may recommend endovascular procedures, which range in price from $2,500 to $3,000. These involve threading a catheter into the vein and directing a heat source such as a laser or radio-frequency device into the vein to incinerate it.

Vein procedures are offered by a range of physicians, including vascular surgeons, dermatologists and cardiologists. Dr. Schneider, trained as both a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist, suggests that patients ask if a doctor is board-certified in a vascular specialty, or what specialized training the doctor has received in vein therapy.

The Old Way

In a procedure that dates to the 19th century, varicose veins can be removed by stripping—pulling them out with a wire threaded in through an incision. The surgery can cause bleeding, bruising, nerve injuries, scarring and infection, and legs may have to be wrapped with bandages for several weeks.

While some veins may still require stripping surgery, most can be treated with less invasive therapies. Last summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved an injectable drug for sclerotherapy that has been widely used in Europe for years, polidocanol—sold under the brand name Asclera—for use in the tiniest varicose veins, known as spider veins, and for so-called reticular veins that are one to three millimeters in diameter.

The drug has a strong safety record, and it also has anesthetic properties, which makes treatments more comfortable for patients, according to Suman Rathbun, director of the vascular medicine program at the University of Oklahoma Health Sciences Center in Oklahoma City. Although Asclera isn't approved to treat large veins, Dr. Rathbun and others are using it off-label for that purpose, converting the liquid into a foam. When injected, Dr., Rathbun says, it fills the vein better than the liquid, which sometimes leaks out, making it less effective.

Laser Procedures

Studies have shown that minimally invasive endovenous laser procedures that use local anesthesia are highly effective for removing the so-called saphenous veins—a large one that runs from the foot to the thigh and a smaller one up the back of the leg behind the knee—and have a high rate of success over time.

Nancy Neukam, 67, says she decided to try the procedure because the bulging blue varicose veins in her lower left leg were increasingly unsightly and painful. Though she feared treatment would be painful and difficult, Ms. Neukam took half a Valium and slept, feeling nothing as Baltimore dermatologist Robert Weiss guided a catheter and laser tip into the vein to seal it closed in 40 minutes.

Ms. Neukam had to wear compression stockings for three days afterward and had some bruising, but now, she says, ""I play golf and don't mind wearing a skirt or Bermuda shorts anymore, and my legs look and feel wonderful.""

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Sophisticated brain scans accurately predicted which teens with dyslexia would learn to read within three years, a finding that could lead to better ways to treat the common learning disability, researchers said on Monday.

By looking for a specific pattern of brain activity in teens with dyslexia, the researchers predicted with 90 percent accuracy which students would learn to read.

“This gives us hope that we can identify which children might get better over time,” Dr. Fumiko Hoeft of Stanford University School of Medicine, whose study appears in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, said in a statement.

“More study is needed before the technique is clinically useful, but this is a huge step forward.”

Dyslexia is a brain-based learning disability that affects 5 to 17 percent of U.S. children. People with dyslexia have difficulties with reading, spelling, writing and pronouncing words.

About one-fifth of people with severe dyslexia learn to read. Hoeft and colleagues wanted to see what was occurring in the brain in these students.

They studied 45 teens aged 11 to 14 who took a battery of tests to determine their reading abilities. Based on these, they classified 25 of them as dyslexics.

The team used two different imaging techniques, including functional magnetic resonance imaging, which measures oxygen used by the brain during different activities, and diffusion tensor magnetic resonance imaging or DTI, which reveals connections between brain areas.

The researchers then showed the teens different pairs of words and asked then to identify which ones rhymed, even though they were spelled differently.

They found that about half of the children who were dyslexic had extra activity in a part of the brain near the right temple known as the right inferior frontal gyrus.

And some of the children with dyslexia had stronger connections in a network of brain fibers that links the front and the back of the brain.

When they checked these same children two and a half years later, they found children who had this unusual brain activity were more likely to have learned to read than other dyslexics.

Paper and pencil tests typically used for these children, however, were unable to predict which students would succeed.

“The reason this is exciting is that until now, there have been no known measures that predicted who will learn to compensate,” Hoeft said.

Alan Guttmacher, director the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, one of the National Institutes of Health, said the finding gives insight into how certain people with dyslexia compensate for reading problems.

“Learning why other individuals have difficulty compensating may lead to new treatments to help them overcome reading disability,” Guttmacher, whose agency funded the study, said in a statement.

The study is part of a new field called “educational neuroscience” that uses brain imaging studies to help improve learning problems in children and teens.",0

More than a third of American adults use some form of complementary or alternative medicine, according to a government report. Natural remedies have an obvious appeal, but how do you know which ones to choose and whether the claims are backed by science? In this occasional series, the New York Times “Really?” columnist, Anahad O’Connor, explores the claims and the science behind alternative remedies that you may want to consider for your family medicine cabinet.

The Remedy: Honey

The Claim: It relieves coughing.

The Science: For decades, parents looking for an over-the-counter medicine to cure a child’s sickness and coughing have turned to syrupy medicines containing dextromethorphan, a popular cough suppressant found in products like Children’s Dimetapp DM and Robitussin DM.

But in 2007, a Food and Drug Administration advisory panel declared the products potentially harmful in small children and recommended a ban on many of them. As an alternative, many experts suggest something as simple as a spoonful of honey or even a small cup of flavored water, which have few side effects and seem to be effective.

The thinking is that sweet substances of any kind help soothe the back of the throat and break up mucus in the airways. Honey is also known to have antioxidant and antimicrobial properties.

In one double-blind study published in The Archives of Pediatric and Adolescent Medicine, researchers recruited 105 children and teenagers who had coughs from upper-respiratory infections. The subjects were randomly divided into three groups: one that received no treatment, another that received one or two teaspoons of buckwheat honey, and a third that received a dose of honey-flavored dextromethorphan. Ultimately, the honey produced the greatest improvements when it came to better sleep and reduced cough frequency and severity.

The study was carried out by pediatricians at the Pennsylvania State University medical school and supported by a grant from the National Honey Board, an industry-backed agency of the Department of Agriculture.

In a similar study published in the journal Pediatrics in 2004, researchers recruited 100 children with upper respiratory tract infections who had been coughing for an average of over three days. The children were given a cough syrup with dextromethorphan, a cough syrup containing an antihistamine, or a placebo, which was essentially flavored water. Although children in all three groups experienced a reduction in coughing, those who received the flavored water fared the best.

The Risks: According to the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, honey may be useful in relieving coughing, but it should never be given to children under a year of age because in rare cases it can cause infantile botulism.",1

MONDAY, Dec. 13, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture may be an effective way to treat older children struggling with a certain form of lazy eye, new research from China suggests, although experts say more studies are needed.

Lazy eye (amblyopia) is essentially a state of miscommunication between the brain and the eyes, resulting in the favoring of one eye over the other, according to the National Eye Institute.

The study authors noted that anywhere from less than 1 percent to 5 percent of people worldwide are affected with the condition. Of those, between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia, which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes.

Standard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues. However, while this approach is often successful in younger children (between the ages of 3 and 7), it is successful among only about a third of older children (between the ages of 7 and 12).

For the latter group, doctors will often place a patch over the ""good"" eye temporarily in addition to eyeglasses, and treatment success is typically achieved in two-thirds of cases.

Children, however, often have trouble adhering to patch therapy, the treatment can bring emotional issues for some and a reverse form of lazy eye can also take root, the researchers said.

Study author Dr. Dennis S.C. Lam, from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and Institute of Chinese Medicine at the Joint Shantou International Eye Center of Shantou University and Chinese University of Hong Kong, and his colleagues report their observations in the December issue of the Archives of Ophthalmology.

In the search for a better option than patch therapy, Lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture, noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia.

Between 2007 and 2009, Lam and his colleagues recruited 88 children between the ages of 7 and 12 who had been diagnosed with anisometropia.

About half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture, targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points (located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region, as well as the legs and hands). The other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy, combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near-vision exercises such as reading.

After about four months of treatment, the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group. In fact, they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly 42 percent of the acupuncture patients, that figure dropped to less than 17 percent among the patch patients.

Neither treatment prompted significant side effects, the authors said.

The team nonetheless pointed out that their study's tracking period was relatively short, and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates, depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist.

And while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow, retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity, the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood.

Dr. Richard Bensinger, a Seattle-based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the American Academy of Ophthalmology, said that the finding is ""certainly suggestive and worth following up.""

""This is kind of cool,"" he said. ""But I will say that I don't know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision. There are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain, and I think there's pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect. But for vision therapy this is the first I've heard of it, and I don't know that anyone has ever tried this before. So this is like a teaser.""

""Of course people in those parts of the country, like where I live, where there's fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others,"" Bensinger cautioned. ""And no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it's not the best treatment. And as an alternative approach, this may not be covered.""

""But if it works,"" he added, ""people will certainly be excited -- although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it's really beneficial or not.""

For his part, Dr. Stanley Chang, chairman of the ophthalmology department at Columbia University in New York City, did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture's potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy.

""Acupuncture I think definitely works for pain amelioration, but I'm not sure it works for some of these other things,"" he cautioned. ""They've tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma, without much success. And so although there haven't been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies, my guess is that it's probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye.""

""However, I think it's worth considering or trying,"" Chang added, ""because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age, including patch therapy. But what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - Taking low doses of aspirin can reduce the risk of many kinds of cancer, scientists said on Tuesday, and the evidence is strong enough to suggest people over 40 should take it daily as protection.

The findings will fuel an already intense debate about the merits of taking aspirin, which increases the risk of bleeding in the stomach to around one patient in every thousand per year.

In a study of eight trials involving 25,570 patients, researchers found that cancer deaths among those who took aspirin in doses as low as 75 milligrams a day were 21 percent lower during the studies and 34 percent lower after five years.

Aspirin protected people against gastrointestinal cancers the most, the study found, with rates of death from these cancers around 54 percent lower after five years among those who took aspirin compared to those who did not.

Peter Rothwell of Britain’s Oxford University said that while taking aspirin carries a small risk of stomach bleeding, that risk was beginning to be “drowned out” by its benefits in reducing the risk of cancer and the risk of heart attacks.

“Previous guidelines have rightly cautioned that in healthy middle-aged people the small risk of bleeding on aspirin partly offsets the benefit from prevention of strokes and heart attacks, but the reductions in deaths due to several common cancers will now alter this balance for many people,” he said.

His suggestion was that healthy people could start taking a small 75 mg dose of aspirin every day from the age of about 40 or 45 and continue doing so until they reached around 70 to 75, when the risk of the aspirin causing stomach bleeding rises.

“REMARKABLE DRUG”

Aspirin, originally developed by Bayer, is a cheap over-the-counter drug used for pain and to reduce fever.

Previous studies have found taking aspirin can cut the risk of developing colon or bowel cancer and suggested it does so by blocking the enzyme cyclooxygenase2 which promotes inflammation and cell division and is found in high levels in tumors.

Alastair Watson, professor of translational medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the study was an important step in scientists’ understanding of how to prevent cancer.

“It is further proof that aspirin is, by a long way, the most amazing drug in the world,” he said.

In Rothwell’s study, published in The Lancet, researchers found the 20-year risk of death was reduced by about 10 percent for prostate cancer, 30 percent for lung cancer, 40 percent for colorectal or bowel cancer and 60 percent for oesophageal cancer in those taking aspirin.

Reductions in pancreas, stomach and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths.

The researchers added, however, that treatment with aspirin during the trials lasted for only for between four and eight years on average, so the effects on risk of deaths due to cancer may underestimate possible results of longer-term treatment.

Peter Elwood, an expert on aspirin from Cardiff University’s medical school who was not involved in this study, described aspirin as “a remarkable drug.”

“This risk of a bleed is so small compared to the benefits,” he told reporters. “Yes, okay, it’s a tragedy if a person is rushed into hospital and given a transfusion (because of a stomach bleed) but in relation to the things we are preventing, that is trivial.”",1
"Many Americans take aspirin to lower their risk of heart disease, but a new study suggests a remarkable added benefit, reporting that patients who took aspirin regularly for a period of several years were 21 percent less likely decades later to die of solid tumor cancers, including cancers of the stomach, esophagus and lung.

As part of the new study, published online Monday in the journal Lancet, researchers examined the cancer death rates of 25,570 patients who had participated in eight different randomized controlled trials of aspirin that ended up to 20 years earlier.

Participants who had been assigned to the aspirin arms of the studies were 20 percent less likely after 20 years to have died of solid tumor cancers than those who had been in the comparison group taking dummy pills during the clinical trials, and their risk of gastrointestinal cancer death was 35 percent lower. The risk of lung cancer death was 30 percent lower, the risk of colorectal cancer death was 40 percent lower and the risk of esophageal cancer death was 60 percent lower, the study reported.

The specific dose of aspirin taken did not seem to matter — most trials gave out low doses of 75 to 100 milligrams — but the participants in the longest lasting trials had the most drastic reductions in cancer death years later.

“This is important as a proof of principle that a single simple compound like aspirin can reduce the risk of cancer substantially,” said the study’s lead author, Dr. Peter M. Rothwell, professor of neurology at the University of Oxford. “There’s been a lot of work over the years showing that certain compounds can increase the risk of cancer, but it’s not been shown before that we can reduce the risk with something as simple as aspirin.”",1
"Dec. 6, 2010 -- Taking aspirin over a long period of time can substantially cut the risk of dying from a variety of cancers, according to a study showing that the benefit is independent of dose, gender, or smoking. It also found that the protective effect increases with age. The study is by Peter Rothwell, MD, PhD, FRCP, of John Radcliffe Hospital in Oxford, England, and colleagues, and has been published online by the journal the Lancet. A previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin (75-300 milligrams) reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third. The latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers.

New Aspirin-Cancer Findings The study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving 25,570 patients, 674 of whom died from cancer. They showed a 21% reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin, compared with people who had not. The investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time. After five years, death rates were shown to fall by 34% for all cancers and by 54% for gastrointestinal cancers. Participants were also followed up after 20 years, by which point 1,634 of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer. This 20-year follow-up established that the risk of cancer death remained 20% lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers, including lung, prostate, brain, bladder, and kidney cancers, and by 35% for gastrointestinal cancers. The fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer: Esophageal cancer (60%)

Colorectal cancer (40%)

Lung cancer (30%)

Prostate cancer (10%) Reductions in pancreatic, stomach, and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths, the authors say.",1

MONDAY, Dec. 6, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Long-term use of a daily low-dose aspirin dramatically cuts the risk of dying from a wide array of cancers, a new investigation reveals.

Specifically, a British research team unearthed evidence that a low-dose aspirin (75 milligrams) taken daily for at least five years brings about a 10 percent to 60 percent drop in fatalities depending on the type of cancer.

The finding stems from a fresh analysis of eight studies involving more than 25,500 patients, which had originally been conducted to examine the protective potential of a low-dose aspirin regimen on cardiovascular disease.

The current observations follow prior research conducted by the same study team, which reported in October that a long-term regimen of low-dose aspirin appears to shave the risk of dying from colorectal cancer by a third.

""These findings provide the first proof in man that aspirin reduces deaths due to several common cancers,"" the study team noted in a news release.

But the study's lead author, Prof. Peter Rothwell from John Radcliffe Hospital and the University of Oxford, stressed that ""these results do not mean that all adults should immediately start taking aspirin.""

""They do demonstrate major new benefits that have not previously been factored into guideline recommendations,"" he added, noting that ""previous guidelines have rightly cautioned that in healthy middle-aged people, the small risk of bleeding on aspirin partly offsets the benefit from prevention of strokes and heart attacks.""

""But the reductions in deaths due to several common cancers will now alter this balance for many people,"" Rothwell suggested.

Rothwell and his colleagues published their findings Dec. 7 in the online edition of The Lancet.

The research involved in the current review had been conducted for an average period of four to eight years. The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after.

The authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended.

At five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin.

The protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road.

Twenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients.

The potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases.

They also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients.

And while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this ""proof of principle,"" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most.

Dr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as ""very significant.""

""[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,"" he noted.

""The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,"" Arslan added. ""However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting. Aspirin has risks of side effects, including bleeding and stroke.""

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. researchers are closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment.

An autistic child peers from between curtains at the Consulting Centre for Autism in Amman, March 30, 2010. REUTERS/Ali Jarekji

The test, which uses conventional magnetic resonance imaging or MRI machines, detected 94 percent of individuals with a high-functioning form of autism, they reported on Thursday.

“These results are the best yet in the search for a biological basis in terms of being able to distinguish those with and without the disease,” said Nicholas Lange of Harvard Medical School, who directs the Neurostatistics Laboratory at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts.

He said the findings, published in the journal Autism Research, were very preliminary, but if confirmed in several more and larger studies, they might replace current subjective tests now used to diagnose the disorder.

And, he said, they might also lead to better management and treatment of people with autism, a complex and mysterious brain disorder usually first diagnosed in early childhood.

Autism is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding other people’s emotions and behavior.

For the study, researchers at McLean and a team led by Dr. Janet Lainhart the University of Utah used an MRI that was tuned to pick up microscopic features of the brain’s wiring — a technique known as diffusion tensor imaging.

“You don’t need any fancy equipment. This is performed around the world,” Lange said in a telephone interview.

The team did scans of this type on the brains of 30 people with autism and 30 people without.

They found that the brain circuitry is significantly different in those with autism compared to people with normal brain function, specifically in areas of the brain that are engaged in language and social and emotional functioning.

By measuring six aspects of the brain’s circuitry, the test was able to correctly pick out people who had been diagnosed with autism with 94 percent accuracy.

A repeat study using two different sets of subjects showed the same high level of performance.

Lange said the findings should help make the process of diagnosing autism more scientific because it would rely on a test rather than a subjective assessment.

And it may also offer an early diagnosis, which could help affected children get earlier intervention, when it is most likely to do some good.

“The basis of autism in the brain is very deep. There may be very little that one can actually change about the disorder for an individual with a severe case,” Lange said.

“However, it has been shown that in the early stages of development, individuals have been aided by intense one-on-one caring to help them with language, social function with their peers and also with emotional problems,” he said.

Autism disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States and affect four times as many boys as girls.",0
"Scientists are finding more pieces of the autism puzzle of with the help of MRI scans of brain circuitry, according to a study published Thursday online in the journal Autism Research.

By scanning the brain for 10 minutes using magnetic resonance imaging, researchers were able to measure six physical differences of microscopic fibers in the brains of 30 males with confirmed high-functioning autism and 30 males without autism.

The images of the brains helped researchers correctly identify those with autism with 94 percent accuracy, says Nicholas Lange, an associate professor of psychiatry at Harvard Medical School and one of the study authors.

""No one has measured what we measured,"" says Lange of the MRI test he and Dr. Janet Lainhart from the University of Utah developed.

While previous studies using different types of scans have been able to identify people with autism, Lange says, ""no one has looked at it [the brain] the way we have and no one has gotten these type of results.""

Lange is quick to caution that this type of test is not yet ready for prime time. ""We do not want to give anyone false hopes that this is ready for the clinic yet. This method, this test, needs to be tried [and confirmed] with many more subjects outside our laboratory,"" he says. Plus, the research needs to be expanded to many more study participants and tried on younger people with autism and those who are not as high-functioning as the subjects in this first trial.

Using the MRI, the study authors measured how the water in the brain flows along the axons or nerve fibers in the parts of the brain that control language, social and emotional functioning. The scans revealed that the wiring of the brains of those with autism was disorganized compared with the brains of a typical person without autism. This is how they could determine which brains scans belonged those study participants with autism.

The study included only males between the ages of 7 and 28 because they were part of a bigger research project at the University of Utah, which is following males with autism for a longer period. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates 1 in 110 children in the United States have an autism spectrum disorder and boys are far more likely to have this neurological disorder that affects language and social behavior – that number is about 1 in 70. However future studies will include girls too.

Currently there's no biologic test for autism, so pediatricians look to see if a child is meeting certain developmental milestones as well as signs and symptoms of autism. (The advocacy group Autism Speaks has posted videos to help parents see the signs of autism)

The earlier a child has been identified as having autism, the earlier behavioral therapies can be applied to lessen the impact of the disorder later in life. Lange believes this brain scans can be done on younger children, as long as they can go to sleep in the scanner – on their own, without sedation (because you can't move during the test).

Carissa Cascio, an assistant professor of psychiatry from Vanderbilt University School of Medicine, who specializes in autism and neuro-imaging, believes these study results are important. But she cautions that using this method as a true diagnostic tool to detect autism in a child is ""a long way off."" ""What this paper seems to be doing is taking the first steps towards parlaying what we are able to glean from brain imaging into potential diagnostic tools.""

Zachary Warren, who is the director of the Vanderbilt Kennedy Center Treatment and Research Institute for Autism Spectrum Disorders (TRIAD), says since there are many types of autism, ""it becomes very challenging to capture all these differences with one test."" Still he believes this is new study can help pinpoint the earliest markers of concern in developing brains.",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - Men with long index fingers have a lower risk of prostate cancer, British scientists said on Wednesday, a finding that could be used to help select those who need regular screening for the disease.

Researchers at Britain’s Warwick University and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) found that men whose index finger is longer than their ring finger were one-third less likely to develop the disease than men with the opposite pattern of finger lengths.

“Relative finger length could be used as a simple test for prostate cancer risk, particularly in men aged under 60,” said Ros Eeles from the ICR, who helped lead the study.

She said the finding, which the scientists believe may be related to levels of the male hormone testosterone, could be used in combination with other factors such as family history or genetic testing to select at-risk men for screening.

Screening for prostate cancer is controversial because the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests used cannot differentiate between men with aggressive cancer and those who would never have symptoms or need treatment.

A study in the United States last year found routine prostate cancer screening there had resulted in more than one million men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.

In the latest study, published in the British Journal of Cancer, Eeles’s team explained that the relative length of index and ring fingers is set before birth and is believed to relate to the levels of sex hormones to which a baby is exposed in the womb.

The researchers said they believed that being exposed to less testosterone before birth helped protect against prostate cancer later in life. The phenomenon was believed to occur because genes known as HOXA and HOXD controlled finger length and the development of sex organs, they said.

HORMONE LEVELS

Previous studies have linked finger length to aggression, fertility, sporting ability and confidence and reaction times.

“Our study indicates it is the hormone levels that babies are exposed to in the womb that can have an effect decades later,” said Ken Muir of Warwick University, who co-led the research.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men after lung cancer and kills around 254,000 men a year worldwide.

The scientists questioned more than 1,500 prostate cancer patients at three British hospitals between 1994 and 2009 and compared them with 3,000 healthy men. The men were shown pictures of different finger length patterns and asked to identify the one most similar to their own.

The most common pattern, which was seen in more than half the men in the study, was a shorter index than ring finger, the researchers reported.

Men whose index and ring fingers were the same length — about 19 percent of those studied — had a similar prostate cancer risk, but men whose index fingers were longer than their ring finger were 33 percent less likely to have prostate cancer.",0

MONDAY, Nov. 29, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Women who have had breast cancer should consider annual screening with breast MRI in addition to an annual mammogram, new research indicates.

Currently, the American Cancer Society recommends annual breast MRI plus mammography for women at very high risk for breast cancer, such as those with a known genetic mutation known as BRCA or those with a very strong family history. But it takes no position on MRI imaging for women who have had breast cancer, saying there is not enough evidence to recommend one way or the other.

Studying the effectiveness of MRI screening on all three groups of women, Dr. Wendy DeMartini, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Washington Medical School, said MRI imaging found proportionally more cancers in women who had been treated for breast cancer than in the women considered at very high risk.

""Women in the personal history group [who had MRI] were also less likely to be recalled for additional testing, and less likely to have a biopsy for a false positive finding,"" she said.

DeMartini was scheduled to present the findings Sunday at the annual meeting of the Radiological Society of North America in Chicago.

For the study, her team reviewed initial breast MRI exams of 1,026 women, conducted from January 2004 to June 2009. Of these, 327 had a genetic or family history; 646 had a personal history of breast cancer that had been treated.

Overall, the MRI detected 25 of 27 cancers, DeMartini said. With the MRI screen, ""we found cancer in just over 3 percent of women [with a personal history], which was double [that found in those with a genetic or family history],"" she said.

However, still more research is needed to clarify the role of MRI in this population, she said.

""The findings are impressive,"" said Dr. Robert Smith, director of cancer screening for the American Cancer Society. While the society recommends neither for nor against MRI imaging for those with a personal history of breast cancer, he said it regularly reviews study findings to determine if the guidelines need updating.

""There are some tumors that don't show up on mammography as well as they do on MRI,"" he explained. MRI highlights angiogenesis, the formation of new blood vessels, especially those that feed cancerous tissues.

Until more research is in, what should a woman with a personal history of breast cancer do?

""She should talk to her doctor,"" Smith said. He doesn't see a downside to getting an MRI, except perhaps an increased risk of false positives and perhaps a need to pay out of pocket.

"WASHINGTON—The Food and Drug Administration questioned the clinical benefit of using GlaxoSmithKline PLC's Avodart to cut the risk of prostate cancer.

Avodart is currently approved to treat benign enlargement of the prostate. The company is seeking FDA approval to market the drug to certain men to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. The drug will be reviewed by an FDA advisory panel on Wednesday along with Merck & Co.'s Proscar, a drug similar to Avodart.

GlaxoSmithKline conducted a study involving more than 8,000 men considered at high risk of developing prostate cancer. Overall, the study found a 23% reduction in the risk of developing prostate cancer over a four-year period among those treated with Avodart, compared to patients receiving a placebo. The company has proposed that men considered at high risk for the development of prostate cancer are those who have had a prior negative biopsy and have an elevated serum prostate-specific antigen, or PSA.

In a document posted on the FDA's website Monday, the agency said the study results involving Avodart ""do not appear to confer clinical benefit for the indication under consideration.""

The agency said the reduction in prostate cancer risk was driven by prostate cancers considered to be low-risk. There was an increase in prostate cancers considered ""high-risk"" or those with a so-called Gleason Score of 8 to 10 among patients treated with Avodart compared to those receiving a placebo drug, the FDA said. Higher Gleason Scores indicate more aggressive cancers.

Specifically, 29 high-grade tumors were found among patients being treated with Avodart compared to 19 in the placebo group.

Anne Phillips, a medicines development leader at GlaxoSmithKline, said the company believes Avodart can be safely used to lower the risk of prostate cancer ""without interfering with the ability to pick up the high-grade cancer."" She noted that men diagnosed with prostate cancer are often treated aggressively even in cases where their tumors are low-grade or low-risk.

Merck is seeking to add the results of a separate clinical study sponsored by the National Cancer Institute that suggested Proscar cut the risk of prostate cancer, although the company isn't seeking FDA approval to market Proscar to reduce the risk of prostate cancer. Proscar is widely available as a generic drug.

The FDA said the proposed label changes ""could be interpreted to suggest that Proscar is safe and effective for the prevention of prostate cancer in healthy men.""

The agency said there was an increased risk of high-grade cancers among men treated with Proscar and a decreased risk of lower-grade cancers compared to those treated with a placebo over a period of about seven years.

TUESDAY, Nov. 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Implantable devices designed to control heart rhythm and efficiency while preventing sudden death among heart failure patients are as effective at ensuring patient survival in real-world situations as they are in controlled study environments, new research suggests.

The finding is based on an analysis of nearly 186,000 patients outfitted with either an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD), a cardiac resynchronization therapy device (CRT), or a defibrillator combined with a CRT device (a CRT-D).

The study authors noted that the observation is somewhat surprising, given that some of the patients not enrolled in structured studies have already experienced a cardiac event and are therefore prescribed such devices to prevent a recurrence.

This would suggest that real-world heart failure patients, as a whole, might be more vulnerable to fatal events than those tracked in a study setting.

""I'm very encouraged that survival after defibrillator implant is as good as it is for as long as it is,"" co-author Dr. Leslie A. Saxon, chief of the division of cardiovascular medicine at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles, said in a news release from the American Heart Association.

""There's a lot of good news here,"" she added.

Saxon and her team reported their observations in the Nov. 22 online edition of Circulation.

Crunching the numbers, the authors determined that 92 percent of ICD patients survive one year out from device implantation. The same is true for 88 percent of CRT-D patients, they noted.

Five years out, those figures dipped to 68 percent for ICD patients and 54 percent for CRT-D patients.

Among those outfitted with CRT devices alone, one-year survival was pegged at 82 percent, while five-year survival came in at 48 percent, the investigators found.

The poorer prognosis for CRT-only patients was attributed to their older average age (76 years), and the fact that they may be relatively sicker overall. Patients today tend to receive CRT devices with defibrillators.

The study team also found that patients whose implants were monitored remotely, on a continual basis, by a health facility network were about half as likely to die as patients who only had intermittent in-person assessments.

Remote monitoring via telephone lines and online physician access is available for all ICD and CRT-D devices, the authors noted, and enrollment in such programs is typically free with a cardiologist's recommendation.

""It's highly likely the reason these patients did better is that they were receiving earlier diagnoses, and they were also empowered to take charge of their own health care more,"" Saxon said. ""I don't think there's any reason not to put a patient on it.""

Dr. Eric N. Prystowsky, cardiologist and director of clinical electrophysiology at St. Vincent Medical Center in Indianapolis, said that the findings are ""good news,"" but cautioned against over-interpreting the data.

""These are very basic facts, concerning simply who lived and died,"" he noted. ""So we don't really know what it all means, and it's inappropriate to suggest that we could, based only on this compilation of data.""

But, Prystowsky continued, ""this analysis does show two impressive things: one, that patients who are not super-selected for a trial do well with these devices from a mortality standpoint; and two, that patients who had home-monitoring had better outcomes.""

Prystowsky added, ""Now on the latter point, again, from this data we can't say exactly why that is. But at our facility we think it makes caring for a patient much easier. Physicians knowing things sooner will theoretically give a patient a better chance for quicker access to appropriate care. And that has to be good. So we think there's certainly no downside to remote monitoring and, wherever possible, it's reasonable to want to do this.""

"But the drug works best when given every four weeks, which can be inconvenient for patients and doctors. Doctors often give Lucentis less frequently, but even if that regimen produces good results, patients must still get checkups every month to make sure their vision is not deteriorating.

Regeneron’s drug, which is called VEGF Trap-Eye, “gives us the opportunity to not have to see them monthly,” said Dr. Jeffrey Heier of Boston, an investigator in one of the trials and a consultant to Regeneron. That would be “very meaningful to patients and their families,” he said.

Regeneron and its partner, Bayer, said they planned to apply for approval of the drug in the first half of 2011.

The two similar trials involved a total of 2,457 patients who were randomly chosen to receive either Lucentis every four weeks or VEGF Trap-Eye either every four weeks or every eight weeks. In the eight-week arm, the first three doses were given every four weeks.

After a year, roughly 95 percent of the patients in all the arms of the trial maintained their vision, meaning their ability to read an eye chart declined by no more than 15 letters, or three lines.

VEGF Trap-Eye was also “noninferior” to Lucentis in terms of the average change in vision after one year. Lucentis recipients had a mean gain of 8.1 letters and 9.4 letters in the two trials. Those getting Regeneron’s drug every eight weeks had gains of 7.9 letters and 8.9 letters.

Regeneron said the two drugs were equally safe.

Both VEGF Trap-Eye and Lucentis block a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor that causes blood vessels to grow and leak into the eye.

VEGF Trap-Eye could become the first big product for Regeneron, which was founded in 1988 and is based in Tarrytown, N.Y. It sells one drug for a rare disease and has garnered hundreds of millions of dollars from licensing deals with big pharmaceutical companies.

Regeneron’s drug is likely to face competition from off-label use of Genentech’s cancer drug Avastin. When used in the eye, Avastin costs about $50 a dose, compared with about $2,000 for Lucentis. Still, even with such low-priced competition, Lucentis has sales exceeding $2 billion globally.

Meanwhile, Advanced Cell Technology, of Marlborough, Mass., said it would test its stem cell therapy on 12 adults with severe vision loss caused by Stargardt’s, an inherited disease.

The company has turned human embryonic stem cells into retinal pigment epithelial cells, which will be surgically implanted into the eye. The hope is that the implanted cells will replace those injured by the disease.

Human embryonic stem cells are controversial because their creation usually entails the destruction of human embryos, although Advanced Cell Technology is working on a technique to avoid that.

Embryonic cells can also form tumors if injected into the body. Dr. Robert Lanza, chief scientist at Advanced Cell, said the company had to prove to the F.D.A. that its retinal cells contained virtually no residual embryonic stem cells. It took a year for the company to get clearance for the trial from the F.D.A.

It is likely to be several years before such a treatment can reach the market, if it works. Still, even starting the trial could be a boost to Advanced Cell, which often makes headlines but has struggled to raise money. Its shares closed at 5 cents on Friday.

Dr. Peter J. Francis, an associate professor at the Oregon Health and Science University, which will be a site for the trial, says the eye is a good place to test stem cell therapy because it is accessible. Also, he said, there is less chance of rejection of the implanted cells because the eye is shielded somewhat from the body’s immune system.

There is no treatment for Stargardt’s, which affects more than 25,000 people in the United States. The disease is usually diagnosed during childhood and it causes a loss of central vision, though not usually peripheral vision.

Ryan Rapoport of Newcastle, Wash., who has the disease, “basically went from normal vision to legally blind in seven months,” said his father, Darrin.

Ryan, now 10, cannot be in the trial because, for safety reasons, it is confined to adults. Still, Mr. Rapoport said, “It gives us some hope, because up until recently there was no hope.”",1
"Nov. 22, 2010 -- Exercising to piano music may help improve balance and prevent falls among the elderly.

A new study shows older men and women who participated in a piano-music-based exercise program were less likely to suffer a fall than those who didn't. Those who exercised to piano music also showed improvements in balance and the manner or style of walking.

“Each year, one-third of the population 65 years and older experiences at least one fall, and half of those fall repeatedly,” write researcher Andrea Trombetti, MD, of University Hospitals and Faculty of Medicine of Geneva, Switzerland, and colleagues in the Archives of Internal Medicine. “Exercise can counteract key risk factors for falls, such as poor balance, and consequently reduce risk of falling in elderly community-dwelling individuals.”

Researchers say a large proportion of falls in elderly people occur while walking, so improving gait and balance can have a major impact on fall prevention.",0
"Nov. 22, 2010 -- Eat your veggies and you may live longer, a study suggests.

The study shows that eating foods rich in antioxidants, like vegetables and fruits, fights disease and may prolong life.

Researchers found that people with the highest levels of the antioxidant alpha-carotene in their blood had a 39% lower risk of death from any cause, including heart disease and cancer, than those who had the lowest levels of the antioxidant during the 14-year study.

""These findings support increasing fruit and vegetable consumption as a means of preventing premature death,"" write researcher Chaoyang Li, MD, PhD, of the CDC and colleagues in the Archives of Internal Medicine.

Alpha-carotene is part of a group of antioxidants known as carotenoids, which also includes beta-carotene and lycopene. Vegetables particularly high in alpha-carotene include yellow-orange vegetables, such as carrots, sweet potatoes, pumpkin, and winter squash, and dark green vegetables, such as broccoli, green beans, green peas, spinach, turnip greens, collards, and lettuce.

Although previous studies have suggested eating more fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of disease, studies have not shown that taking beta-carotene supplements reduces the risk of dying from heart disease or cancer.

Researchers wanted to see if other carotenoids may also play a role in reducing the risk of disease.",0
"“There’s really no precedent for another drug that does this,” said Dr. Matthew R. Smith, a prostate cancer specialist at the Massachusetts General Hospital.

Also, bone scans actually measure bone formation, not the presence of cancer itself. So it cannot be completely ruled out that XL184 somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer. However, Dr. Smith said he doubted that was the case because there were signs the drug also controlled tumors outside the bones.

Drugs now used to treat advanced prostate cancer, like Taxotere, do not have much affect on bone scans, Dr. Smith said. Bone drugs like Zometa from Novartis and denosumab from Amgen can protect cancerous bones from fractures, but have not been shown to fight the cancer itself.

Another investigator in the trial, Dr. David C. Smith of the University of Michigan, said he could not believe it when the bone scan of one patient, who previously had widespread cancer in his bones, came back completely clean.

“I thought they had scanned the wrong person,” said Dr. Smith, who is not related to the doctor in Massachusetts. “I’ve never seen anything like this.”

Exelixis will now add many prostate cancer patients to the midstage clinical trial from which the results were drawn, said Michael M. Morrissey, the company’s chief executive. A late-stage trial could begin as early as next year, he said.

XL184 is believed to block the formation of blood vessels that feed tumors and also inhibits a protein called MET that helps spur tumor growth.

Provenge from Dendreon, by contrast, trains the patient’s immune system to attack the tumor. The drug was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in April after a clinical trial showed that those getting the drug had a median survival of about 26 months, four months longer than those in a control group.

Some critics say Medicare would not be doing a review of a drug already approved by the F.D.A. were it not for its high cost.

“One has to wonder if today’s meeting is about something other than science, namely the cost,” Brad Loncar, an investor in Dendreon whose grandfather died of prostate cancer, told the Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee on Wednesday.

Dr. Louis Jacques, director of the coverage and analysis group at the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, said cost was not a factor and that the agency had reviewed products approved by the F.D.A. in the past.

Dr. Jacques said he ordered the review after being contacted by federal lawmakers questioning why their constituents could not get the drug. He realized that reimbursement by regional Medicare contractors was inconsistent, so he decided the agency should have a uniform national policy.

The Medicare Coverage Advisory Committee, which met in Baltimore, did not discuss the cost of Provenge or make a coverage recommendation. It reviewed the clinical trial data and then rated the strength of the data on a scale of 1 to 5.

The 10 voting members, mainly doctors and health policy experts, averaged 3.6 on the question of how much confidence they had that there was adequate evidence to conclude that Provenge significantly prolongs survival.

That is between 3, which is intermediate confidence and 5, which is high confidence. But some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement. Trading in Dendreon shares, halted during regular market hours, rose 6 percent after hours.

However, the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer patients other than the type who participated in the clinical trial, which were men with advanced cancer, but no or minimal symptoms. That could give Medicare grounds for denying payment when the drug is used off-label, as cancer drugs often are.

Medicare is scheduled to put a proposed decision out for comment by March 30, with a final decision around the end of June.

Provenge has stirred passions since the F.D.A. initially declined to approve it in 2007. Some Dendreon investors and prostate cancer patients staged protests and advertising campaigns and sued the F.D.A. Two doctors who had spurred investor wrath by voting against the drug’s approval at an advisory committee meeting attended a major cancer conference accompanied by bodyguards.

Medicare’s review has drawn hundreds of comments, mostly in favor of coverage. One criticism of the drug was filed by a law firm, Willkie Farr & Gallagher, on behalf of a client who the law firm said wanted to remain anonymous because of the “public vilification of anyone that questions Provenge.”",1
"People who can’t control cholesterol with diet, exercise and statin drugs could soon have a new option.

According to a new study, a medication, ancetrapib, appears to simultaneously raise the level of HDL – sometimes called “good” cholesterol- and to lower the level of LDL, or “bad” cholesterol.

HDL cholesterol is not fully understood, but essentially sucks cholesterol out of cells, to be flushed from the body through the liver.

The study was sponsored by Merck, the drug’s manufacturer. It was published in the New England Journal of Medicine and results were to be presented Wednesday at a meeting of American Heart Association in Chicago.

The so-called DEFINE trial involved 1,623 patients with coronary heart disease or at high risk for it. All were taking statins to lower LDL cholesterol. Roughly half also received ancetrapib, while half got a placebo. On average, within 24 weeks patients getting ancetrapib saw LDL levels drop by nearly 40 percent compared with the placebo group, while their HDL levels rose by 138 percent. There were no significant side effects.

If the same benefit were seen in all patients at risk of heart disease – far from a sure thing – it would translate to hundreds of thousands of fewer deaths and heart attacks over a five-year period, according to Dr. Christopher Cannon, the lead study author and a cardiologist at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston.

“It’s an amazing result,” said Dr. Robert Eckel of the University of Colorado, a past president of the American Heart Association. “It’s like a rocket that landed on Jupiter, rather than the moon.” Still, Eckel warned it’s too soon to say whether ancetrapib would actually prevent disease over the long run.

There’s ample reason for caution. A similar medication, torcetrapib, was considered promising four years ago, but was shelved by Pfizer after studies found it actually raised blood pressure and the risk of heart problems and death.

Dr. PK Shah, cardiologist at the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute, said that he’s encouraged by DEFINE but that some of the details give him pause. “It appears to be safe and to not raise blood pressure,” Shah told CNN, “but it’s not a slam-dunk.” For one thing, despite improved cholesterol levels, patients did not see less inflammation in their blood vessels. Inflammation is a sign of damage from cholesterol.

To try to provide final answers, Merck is launching a study – called REVEAL – to follow 30,000 people, in several countries, over four years. The first patients will be enrolled in April, according to Dr. Rory Collins of Oxford University, where the research will be overseen.

Lee Davies, a Merck spokesman, said the company is not likely to seek FDA approval until those results are in, most likely in 2015. By then, results will also be in on a large study of a similar drug, dalcetrapib, made by Merck’s competitor, Roche.",1

TUESDAY, Nov. 16, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- By substituting a healthy gene for a defective one, scientists were able to partially restore the heart's ability to pump in 39 heart failure patients, researchers report.

""This is the first time gene therapy has been tested and shown to improve outcomes for patients with advanced heart failure,"" study lead author Dr. Donna Mancini, professor of medicine and the Sudhir Choudhrie professor of cardiology at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, said in a university news release.

""The therapy works by replenishing levels of an enzyme necessary for the heart to pump more efficiently by introducing the gene for SERCA2a, which is depressed in these patients. If these results are confirmed in future trials, this approach could be an alternative to heart transplant for patients without any other options,"" she added.

Mancini presented the results Monday at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association (AHA) in Chicago.

The gene for SERCA2a raises levels of the enzyme back to where the heart can pump more efficiently. The enzyme regulates calcium cycling, which, in turn, is involved in how well the heart contracts, the researchers said.

""Heart failure is a defect in contractility related to calcium cycling,"" explained Dr. Robert Eckel, past president of the AHA and professor of medicine at the University of Colorado Denver.

The study authors hope that, if replicated in larger trials, the gene-therapy treatment could actually delay or obviate the need for heart transplants in patients with heart failure.

""There are a lot of treatments for heart failure but at some point patients stop responding and then the prognosis is poor,"" said Dr. Rita Redberg, AHA spokeswoman and professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco. After that, the only option is a transplant.

For this phase 2 study, 39 patients with advanced heart failure were randomly chosen to receive either the gene therapy (through cardiac catheterization) or a placebo.

At both six months and a year later, the patients who had received the new gene saw their risk for death, cardiac transplantation, worsening heart failure and hospitalization decline by half.

Results were even more heartening at higher doses, where participants had an 88 percent decrease in risk for death, cardiac transplant, hospitalizations and other outcomes, the study authors said.

Redberg cautioned that the study was still preliminary and ""requires more investigation.""

And research presented at meetings isn't subjected to the same level of scrutiny as studies published in peer-reviewed journals.

The study was funded by the Celladon Corp. of La Jolla, Calif.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Men who underwent heart bypass surgery and consumed about two drinks a day afterward had fewer subsequent cardiovascular procedures than those who abstained, according to a study released Sunday.

Light alcohol consumption was associated with a 25 percent reduction in additional heart procedures, heart attacks or strokes in the study by Italian researchers, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in Chicago.

“The benefit of light amounts of alcohol consumption has been documented in healthy individuals, but our analysis showed a benefit from light alcohol intake in post-coronary bypass patients,” said Dr. Umberto Benedetto, of the University of Rome La Sapienza.

However, bypass patients with a condition called left ventricular dysfunction who were heavy drinkers, defined as having more than six drinks daily, were twice as likely to die from heart problems, the study found.

The Italian researchers used a questionnaire to compare alcohol consumption in 1,021 men who underwent heart bypass surgery and reviewed their medical history for 3-1/2 years.

The study also found no adverse correlation between moderate alcohol consumption and any medication.

The American Heart Association recommends men limit themselves to two drinks a day and women to one drink a day, because too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and have other negative effects.",0
"Probiotics May Help Soothe The Stomach

toggle caption M. Spencer Green/AP

Yogurts and supplements loaded with ""friendly"" bacteria may be able to fight the nefarious ones and soothe fickle bowels, according to a new study.

A Cochrane Library review of 63 studies found that probiotics can shorten the time a person has acute diarrhea -- with no negative side effects. On average, using probiotics reduced a bout of diarrhea by more than a day, and reduced the risk of a prolonged diarrhea episode -- four days or more -- by 59 percent.

Stephen Allen, a pediatrician at Swansea University in the United Kingdom who lead the review, tells Shots that probiotics were effective in almost all the studies, which had more than 8,000 participants total, his team evaluated. Among the different bacteria tested were L. acidophilus, S. boulardii, and L. casei, which occur naturally or are added to products like supplements, yogurt, miso, soy milk and some juices.

""Surprising thing was it didn't really matter what type of probiotic was used or in which setting,"" Allen says. However, the impact of the probiotics varied greatly from study to study, researcher found.

Authors of the review note that probiotics can work in several ways, including robbing the offending bacteria, viruses or parasites of nutrients.

The review confirms the findings of another review in 2004, which also showed that probiotics had some effect against diarrhea. Allen says that since the original review, there's been increasing interest in probiotics and, therefore, more research.

""The conclusions we can draw [now] are much stronger,"" Allen says.

Scientists are also optimistic about using probiotics in developing countries where diarrhea is a big problem and can even be fatal. Even so, Allen says more research is needed to determine the specific strains of bacteria that are most effective. And, he says, researchers need to take a look at probiotic regimes that could best target different cases of acute diarrhea in both developed and developing countries.",1
"There is only “moderate’’ evidence that the newly approved prostate cancer drug Provenge helps patients, according to an analysis done for Medicare that was made public on Wednesday.

The analysis is part of a controversial review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine whether to pay for Provenge, which costs $93,000 per patient and extended lives by about four months in clinical trials. Medicare advisers will meet next Wednesday to discuss the drug, which was developed by Dendreon, a Seattle-based biotechnology company.

Provenge is the first so-called therapeutic cancer vaccine – meaning it works by training the patient’s immune system to attack the tumor – to win F.D.A. approval. The treatment is made for each patient from his own blood. Sales have been small so far because Dendreon’s manufacturing capacity has been limited.

While Medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its debate over paying for Provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients, doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high-priced medicines.

“Not only is C.M.S.’s action contrary to Congress’s intent to ensure beneficiary access to drugs and biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen, but it threatens to stifle future innovation and cancer research for years to come,’’ Dr. Al B. Benson III, president of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said in a comment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services.

But others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies, particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months.

With expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system, especially with private insurance companies. First a drug must get F.D.A. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug.

Medicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug, however.

Some analysts have assumed that Medicare will pay for Provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug’s label – those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms.

The Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label.

The F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge in 2007, setting off protests by patients and Dendreon investors. After Dendreon completed another trial, which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug, Provenge was approved this April.

But the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. One big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert.

Robyn Karnauskas, a biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients Wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of Provenge boded well for reimbursement. “Historically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,’’ she wrote.

Dendreon’s shares rose more than 5 percent in trading after the close of the market.

The assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association under contract to the government’s Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",1

TUESDAY, Nov. 9, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Using high doses of cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins appears to reduce the risk of heart attack, stroke or the need for additional cardiac procedures more than regular doses of statins in people who have had a stroke or suffer from heart disease, two new studies find.

This benefit was seen even among those whose cholesterol levels were already low, researchers say. Statins include widely used medications such as Crestor, Lipitor and Zocor.

""For high-risk people, those with heart disease or [who] have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin, further reduction in LDL cholesterol will give them extra benefit,"" said Dr. Colin Baigent of the Clinical Trial Service Unit and Epidemiological Studies Unit at University of Oxford in the United Kingdom, who was involved in both studies. This applied even if the patients already had low levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL, or ""bad"") cholesterol, he noted.

The reports are published in the Nov. 9 online edition of The Lancet.

In the first study, researchers at Oxford and the University of Sydney in Australia collected data from studies on 170,000 patients who took part in 26 trials. This type of review, called a meta-analysis, gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges.

Among these trials, five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other 21 studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs.

The researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses, taking high-dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional 15 percent, compared to the usual doses of statins.

Specifically, there was a 13 percent reduction in heart-related death or heart attack, a 19 percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a 16 percent reduction in stroke, the researchers found.

When they did an updated analysis of the 21 trials, first major cardiovascular events (such as heart attack and stroke) were lowered by a ""highly significant"" 22 percent for a 1.07 millimole per liter (mmol/L) reduction of LDL cholesterol.

Taking all 26 trials together, deaths were reduced by 10 percent for 1 mmol/L in reduction of LDL cholesterol, with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes.

In addition, there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non-vascular causes, and no excess risk of cancer, even at low LDL cholesterol concentrations.

The second study is a randomized trial called the Study of the Effectiveness of Additional Reductions in Cholesterol and Homocysteine (SEARCH), led by professor Jane Armitage, also a scientist at the CTSU in Oxford.

This trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with 80 milligrams (mg) versus 20 mg simvastatin (Zocor) among 12,000 heart attack survivors.

The study was supported by a grant from Merck (manufacturer of the simvastatin).

Over almost seven years of follow-up, those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in LDL cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose.

The reduction in LDL cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by 6 percent, the researchers found, although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant.

The researchers noted that the higher dose of Zocor (simvastatin) did result in a risk of a muscle disease 10 times higher than that associated with the lower dose. The muscle disease, known as myopathy, can cause pain, weakness, and in its rare but most severe form, destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure. Researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and 53 cases with the higher dose.

Researchers also found that rhabdomyolysis -- the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins -- was diagnosed in seven participants given 80 mg of Zocor (simvastatin), compared to none who were given 20 mg of simvastatin. Two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder, with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor.

Researchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than 40 times the upper limit of normal -- a possible indicator of kidney damage. For this reason, they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on 80 mg of Zocor might be an ""underestimate.""

Baigent noted this side effect is one associated with Zocor, but taking lower doses of other, more powerful statins may alleviate the problem. ""There are newer ways of increasing LDL cholesterol reduction by using the newer, more potent statins such a Lipitor or Crestor,"" he said. (All statins carry the risk of myopathy, but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk.)

Bernard M.Y. Cheung, from the University of Hong Kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial, said that ""people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their LDL-cholesterol lowered intensively.""

Their doctors should consider prescribing a statin, either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin, he said.

""If you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke, either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them, you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the LDL cholesterol,"" Cheung said.

""If your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke, then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol,"" he said. ""But if you are at risk from those diseases, you would need intensive treatment to lower LDL cholesterol, even if your LDL cholesterol level is not very high,"" he added.

Commenting on the studies, Dr. Gregg Fonarow, American Heart Association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that ""despite the proven benefits of LDL cholesterol-lowering with statin therapy, many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety.""

Lowering LDL cholesterol by 50 to 60 percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at 80 mg or rosuvastatin at 20 to 40 mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by 50 to 60 percent, he said.

""Most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins,"" Fonarow said. ""Millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease, who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins, are not currently treated with these agents. But [they] should be.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Screening smokers and former smokers for lung tumors using three-dimensional X-rays reduced their risk of dying from lung cancer by 20 percent, researchers said on Thursday.

The study sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute is the first to show that people can be screened for lung cancer, akin to mammograms for breast cancer and tests for colon and prostate cancer.

“Nothing has ever shown a 20 percent decrease in mortality in this disease ever before. This is huge,” said Regina Vidaver, executive director of the National Lung Cancer Partnership.

The researchers said their findings could save thousands of lives. Lung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society.

The trial of more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, found the “spiral” CT scans apparently catch tumors before they have spread.

“To me this is a game changer,” Vidaver said in a telephone interview. “We will have what breast cancer has now, which is a lot of survivors.”

The researchers have some caveats. They do not know whether the radiation from the CT scans may raise the risk of cancer, and they do not know what the study means for light smokers, younger people, or those who have never smoked.

It is also possible the scans will turn up tumors that would never have killed the patients, and that some people will undergo unnecessary surgery if they are screened.

It is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan.

For the study, the middle-aged and elderly smokers were scanned with either a spiral CT or a chest X-ray once a year for three years starting in August 2002. They were followed for five years.

The researchers waited until an independent panel could document a 20 percent reduction in cancer deaths, or could determine that there was no significant benefit.

As of last month, 354 people who got CTs had died of lung cancer, compared to 442 who got ordinary X-rays. This worked out to a 20.3 percent lower risk of dying for the spiral CT group, and researchers stopped the study.

EARLY DIAGNOSIS

Caught early, lung cancer can be cured surgically, but it causes vague symptoms and usually is not diagnosed until it has spread. Only 15 percent of lung cancer patients live 5 years or more.

“No one should come away from this announcement believing that it is safe to continue to smoke,” National Cancer Institute director Dr. Harold Varmus told a news conference.

“This screening does not prevent lung cancer and it does not protect the large majority of subjects from death by lung cancer,” Varmus said.

Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who is on the board of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said he doubted most people would see the findings as a green light to smoke.

“The majority of lung cancer diagnoses in the United States now are either in people who never smoked or in people who have quit,” Johnson said.

In 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center caused a stir when she published a study saying that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT.

Her ideas were controversial to start with and widely disregarded when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company.

Almost all advanced CT scanners can perform a spiral CT, and about 60 percent of U.S. hospitals have such a machine. Makers include General Electric Co’s GE Healthcare Siemens AG, Toshiba Corp, Hitachi and Philips.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have developed an eye implant that allowed three blind patients to see shapes and objects within days of treatment in a trial and say the device could become routine for some kinds of blindness in five years.

A visually impaired boy takes part in a lesson in Dhaka, May 19, 2010. REUTERS/Andrew Biraj

Experts described the study results as phenomenal and said the device, developed by German researchers, could eventually change the lives of up to 200,000 people worldwide who suffer from blindness due to a degenerative eye disease called retinitis pigmentosa.

The device — known as a sub-retinal implant — sits underneath the retina and works by directly replacing light receptors that are lost as a result of the disease.

After the light detection stage, it uses the eye’s natural image-processing functions to produce a stable visual image.

Eberhart Zrenner, chairman of the University of Tuebingen Eye Hospital in Germany and director of a small company called Retinal Implant AG which is developing the device, said the trial results were a “proof of concept” and would now be taken into further trials in around 25 to 50 patients in Europe.

“We have shown that people can be provided with enough useful vision for daily life,” he said in a telephone interview.

According to the study published in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B journal, one blind patient who had the device implanted was able to identify and find objects placed on a table in front of him, and was able to walk around a room independently.

He could even read a clock face and differentiate between seven shades of grey, the researchers said. Tests were conducted starting from seven to nine days after the device was implanted.

The implant device, which sits completely within the eye, is a tiny plate, measuring just 3 mm squared and a 10th of a millimeter thick, which has around 1,500 tiny light sensors connected to amplifiers and electrodes.

Other types of retinal implants, known as epiretinal implants, sit outside the retina and because they bypass the intact light-sensitive structures in the eyes they require the patient to wear an external camera and processor unit.

Robert Maclaren, a professor of Ophthalmology at Britain’s Oxford University and a consultant retinal surgeon at the Oxford Eye Hospital, who was not involved in this trial, said he was “very excited” by Zrenner’s results.

“It proves the concept that in a patient who has been blind for many years and is unable to see anything, the optic nerves can be re-awakened for them to be able to see again. It’s of phenomenal significance in that regard,” he told Reuters.

“To go from being completely blind for many years, to being able to read a few letters and see shapes is an amazing step.”

Retinitis pigmentosa in a genetic eye condition that leads to blindness and affects about 1 in 4,000 people worldwide.

Zrenner said further trials of the implant should be completed in two to three years and if those proved successful the device could be on the market and available for thousands of patients in about five years’ time.

He was cautious about possible wider applications, but said that if it was developed further, the device may someday be used to help people with severe cases of age-related macular degeneration, the leading cause of blindness in older people.",0
"Previous studies have shown that nitrites — also found in high concentrations in celery, cabbage, and other leafy, green vegetables like spinach — widen blood vessels, but researchers say this was the first to find that nitrites also increase blood flow to the brain .

Beet roots contain high concentrations of nitrates, which are converted into nitrites by bacteria in the mouth . And nitrites help open blood vessels in the body, increasing blood flow and oxygen to places lacking in oxygen.

Nov. 3, 2010 -- Drinking beet juice increases blood flow to the brain in older people, a finding that suggests the dark red vegetable may fight the progression of dementia , a new study shows.

Blood Flow to the Brain

“There have been several very high-profile studies showing that drinking beet juice can lower blood pressure, but we wanted to show that drinking beet juice also increases perfusion, or blood flow, to the brain,” Daniel Kim-Shapiro, PhD, director of the Translational Science Center at Wake Forest University, says in a news release. “There are areas in the brain that become poorly perfused as you age, and that’s believed to be associated with dementia and poor cognition.”

Researchers from the Translational Science Center looked at how dietary nitrates affected 14 adults aged 70 and older over a four-day period. On day one, subjects reported to a laboratory after a 10-hour fast, completed a health status report, and had either a high- or low-nitrate breakfast. The high-nitrate breakfast included 16 ounces of beet juice.

Then they were sent home with lunch, dinner, and snacks that conformed to their assigned diets.

On the second day, after another 10-hour fast, the participants returned to the lab and ate their assigned breakfasts. An hour later, an MRI scan recorded brain flow in each person’s brain. And blood tests before and after breakfast confirmed nitrite levels in the body.

On the third and fourth days, researchers switched diets and repeated the process for each person.

MRI scans showed that after eating a high-nitrate diet, the older adults had increased blood flow to the white matter of the frontal lobes, which are the areas of the brain most commonly associated with the degeneration that leads to dementia and other cognitive conditions.",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Commonly used diabetes drugs such as metformin may help control lung cancer, and may help prevent it, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.

Patients who had taken the drugs to control diabetes were much less likely to have lung cancer spread — which is when it becomes most deadly — the researchers told a meeting of the American College of Chest Physicians.

Metformin, an older and cheaper drug available generically, had a more powerful effect than newer drugs called thiazolidinediones, TZDs or glitazones, the researchers said.

“Our study, as well as other research, suggests an association between metformin and/or TZD use and the risk of developing lung cancer,” said Dr. Peter Mazzone of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio, who led the study.

“However, unique to this study, we have been able to report less advanced cancer in those who do develop cancer, a decreased frequency of squamous cell and small cell carcinomas, and improved survival, when controlled for stage, in people taking metformin and/or TZDs.”

The team reviewed the medical records of 157 lung cancer survivors with diabetes.

Those who had taken either a metformin drug or a TZD were significantly less likely to have advanced lung cancer that had spread — 20 percent of those who took the drugs had tumors that had spread, versus 42 percent of those who had not.

“The initial trend we have seen is toward metformin being more protective than TZDs,” Mazzone said.

TZDs include GlaxoSmithKline’s Avandia, known generically as rosiglitazone, and rival drug Actos, or pioglitazone, made by Takeda Pharmaceutical Co Ltd.

Mazzone said it may be possible one day to use metformin to prevent lung cancer in smokers.

But Dr. David Gutterman, president of the American College of Chest Physicians, said more research would be needed before this could be proposed.

“This new information adds to the growing body of evidence that metformin may help prevent and inhibit the progression of lung cancer,” Gutterman said.

Metformin is one of the most widely used drugs for type 2 diabetes, with 41 million prescriptions written in the United States in 2008, the American College of Chest Physicians said in a statement.

In May, researchers reported an inhaled drug called iloprost, approved to treat pulmonary hypertension might also prevent lung cancer.

In April, researchers said a natural supplement derived from food, called myo-inositol, seems to stop the precancerous changes that lead to lung cancer.

Lung cancer is the No. 1 cancer killer globally, killing 1.2 million people a year. Only 15 percent of people diagnosed with lung cancer are still alive five years later, in part because the disease usually spreads silently for years before it causes clear enough symptoms to be detected.

Early stage lung tumors can often be removed surgically, however.

The World Health Organization estimates 171 million people globally had diabetes in 2000 and predicts that number will nearly double by 2030 to 366 million.",1
"Both tests would be less expensive than colonoscopy, and potentially more effective. Compliance with colonoscopy is low, since people don’t want to have one, and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy, and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine.

Exact Sciences now plans to enlist several thousand patients in a prospective trial designed to win the Food and Drug Administration’s approval. The trial will be completed in 2012 and the test, if approved, should be available shortly thereafter.

“If widely used, and regularly, this test really does have the opportunity to eliminate colon cancer,” said Dr. David A. Ahlquist, a colon cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic and an adviser to Exact Sciences.

The practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity, meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected, and their specificity, meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms.

Exact Sciences reported in July that its test was highly sensitive and specific when applied directly to cells taken from tumors. But in the real world, the tumor DNA must be detected in stool samples, even though almost all the DNA comes from the bacteria of the gut. Just 0.01 percent of the DNA is human, and most of this is normal DNA, not the altered DNA of tumors.

The company reported Thursday at a meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research that in a trial of 1,100 patients, the test had detected 64 percent of adenomas, or polyps, larger than one centimeter in diameter, and 85 percent of cancers, as judged by the colonoscopies also given to the patients.

Dr. Ahlquist said he was very pleased with the new results, especially the 64 percent detection rate for precancerous polyps, since these are best targets for intervention.

Although such a detection rate sounds far from perfect, it can be effective if the test is given on a regular schedule. “The Pap smear detects only 50 percent of cervical cancers, but applied over time it virtually eliminates the disease,” Dr. Ahlquist said.

The specificity of the Exact Sciences test is 88 percent, meaning that 12 percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm. This may be acceptable, given that the worst that will happen is that the patient will get an unnecessary colonoscopy.

“With stool tests, you need a 90 percent specificity,” said Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer expert at Johns Hopkins University who is also an adviser to the company. “Exact Sciences has gotten close to that. There’s a lot of hope for getting a stool-based test.”

Promising results for the blood-based tests were reported this week at a meeting in Barcelona, Spain. Epigenomics said its test had a sensitivity of 86 percent and a specificity of 93 percent.

Proponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other. Dr. Achim Plum, a vice president for Epigenomics, said that 30 to 40 percent of people have small polyps, but less than 10 percent of these ever become cancerous. The colon-based test may pick up too many of these, sending far too many people in for colonoscopy.

“The health economics of such a test make no sense,” he said.

But the blood-based test may have a similar problem, since a positive signal could come from cancers anywhere in the body. If the patient is advised to take a whole body imaging scan, more false positives could be generated “so you end up doing more harm than good,” Dr. Vogelstein said.

Dr. Plum said that Epigenomics did not see its test as being necessarily in competition with the Exact Sciences test, because the blood-based test would be good alternative for people put off by stool testing.",1

THURSDAY, Oct. 28, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A new noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps and colon tumors appears to be more accurate than current noninvasive tests such as the fecal occult blood test, Mayo clinic researchers say.

The search for a highly accurate, noninvasive alternative to invasive screens such as colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is a ""Holy Grail"" of colon cancer research.

In a preliminary trial, the new test was able to identify 64 percent of pre-cancerous polyps and 85 percent of full-blown cancers, the researchers reported.

Dr. Floriano Marchetti, an assistant professor of clinical surgery in the division of colon and rectal surgery at University of Miami Sylvester Comprehensive Cancer Center, said the new test could be an important adjunct to colon cancer screening if it proves itself in further study.

""Obviously, these findings need to be replicated on a larger scale,"" he said. ""Hopefully, this is a good start for a more reliable test.""

Dr. Durado Brooks, director of colorectal cancer at the American Cancer Society, agreed. ""These findings are interesting,"" he said. ""They will be more interesting if we ever get this kind of data in a screening population.""

The study's lead researcher remained optimistic.

""There are 150,000 new cases of colon cancer each year in the United States, treated at an estimated cost of $14 billion,"" noted Dr. David A. Ahlquist, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn.

""The dream is to eradicate colon cancer altogether and the most realistic approach to getting there is screening,"" he said. ""And screening not only in a way that would not only detect cancer, but pre-cancer. Our test takes us closer to that dream.""

Ahlquist was scheduled to present the findings of the study Thursday in Philadelphia at a meeting on colorectal cancer sponsored by the American Association for Cancer Research.

The new technology, called the Cologuard sDNA test, works by identifying specific altered DNA in cells shed by pre-cancerous or cancerous polyps into the patient's stool.

If a DNA abnormality is found, a colonoscopy would still be needed to confirm the results, just as happens now after a positive fecal occult blood test (FOBT) result.

To see whether the test was effective, Ahlquist's team tried it out on more than 1,100 frozen stool samples from patients with and without colorectal cancer.

The test was able to detect 85.3 percent of colorectal cancers and 63.8 percent of polyps bigger than 1 centimeter. Polyps this size are considered pre-cancers and most likely to progress to cancer, Ahlquist said.

The sensitivity of the test is much better than what has been seen in other stool screening tests, the ACS' Brooks added. ""But, showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size. Then we will know if this is a big step forward,"" he said.

According to Ahlquist, Cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre-cancerous polyps, he added.

In addition, the test is the only one that is able to identify cancer in all locations throughout the colon, something which other tests either can't or don't do well, Ahlquist said.

One more advantage: patients do not need to do any special preparation before taking the test, something that other tests require, he added.

Ahlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined. ""We learned there are still some bugs and we can make the test even better,"" he said.

Cologuard is not yet available for sale. Clinical trials comparing the test with colonoscopy are slated to start next year. Ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years.

Ahlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established. It is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test, but far less than a colonoscopy. A fecal occult blood test can cost as little as $23 while a colonoscopy can total $700.

Another benefit is that it would probably need to be done once every three years, while the fecal occult blood test is usually done yearly. Savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the Cologuard test, Ahlquist said.

In two other presentations at the meeting, researchers have linked key gene variants to the risk for colon cancer and also to the prognosis of the disease.

In one study, researchers found that people who have long telomeres, the small strips of DNA that cover the ends of chromosomes, have a 30 percent increased risk of developing colon cancer.

""Even for people their age, their telomeres were longer than you'd expect for healthy people,"" lead researcher Dr. Lisa A. Boardman, an associate professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said in a statement. ""This suggests that there may be two different mechanisms that affect telomere length and that set up susceptibility to cancer,"" she said.

In the other study, a research team led by Kim M. Smits, a molecular biologist and epidemiologist in the GROW-School for Oncology and Developmental Biology at Maastricht University Medical Center in the Netherlands, uncovered a surprise when it came to a gene variant on the KRAS gene called the G variant. This variant, long linked to poorer outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer, actually predicted a better prognosis in early-stage colon cancer.

""You would intuitively think that the G variant would be associated with a poorer prognosis, as it is in late-stage colorectal cancer, but that is not the case,"" Smits said in a statement.

Experts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous peer review of studies published in reputable journals.

"Oct. 28, 2010 -- A University of Manchester, England, engineering professor has invented a portable breast scanner that could lead to more accurate tests for younger women without the need for X-rays. The scanner is based on radiofrequency technology, which is able to quickly show malignant and benign tumors when linked to a computer. It could be used in doctors’ offices.

Radio Waves Radiofrequency or microwave technology for breast cancer detection is not new, but what Zhipeng Wu, PhD, from Manchester’s School of Electrical and Electronic Engineering has achieved is the speed of results and portability. The patented real-time radiofrequency scanner uses computer tomography and works by using the same technology as a mobile phone, but with only a tiny fraction of its power. Costs are reduced and the electronics fit into a case the size of a lunchbox.

Breast Cancer Current mammography testing works well for detecting breast cancer in women over 50 with results of up to 95% accuracy. The Manchester team says it is far less effective for younger women, where the detection rate could be as low as 60% for women under the age of 50. This group, the team says, accounts for 20% of all breast cancer cases.

How It Works While mammography works on breast density, radiofrequency looks at contrasts between normal and diseased breast tissues. The breast is placed in a scanner cup and an image appears on screen. Tumors or other abnormalities show up in red. Wu says in a news release: “The system we have is portable and as soon as you lie down you can get a scan -- it’s real-time. The real-time imaging minimizes the chance of missing a breast tumor during scanning.” Wu says it will even work through a bra. “Although there is still research to be done, the system has great potential to bring a new way for breast cancer diagnosis.”

Reaction Carolyn Rogers, clinical nurse specialist at Breast Cancer Care in the U.K., says in an emailed statement: “Evidence is needed to demonstrate the accuracy and uses of this device. The most effective screening tool for detecting breast cancer is mammography and for women of all ages to remain breast aware, reporting any changes to their [doctor].”",1
"Oct. 28, 2010 -- A new, consumer-friendly test for colon cancer, once approved, could persuade more Americans to undergo screening for the deadly cancer, according to researchers presenting their findings on the test's effectiveness at a cancer conference in Philadelphia. At the same meeting, other researchers reported that they have new clues about how DNA characteristics can help predict colon cancer risk. The research was presented at the American Association for Cancer Research's special conference, Colorectal Cancer: Biology to Therapy.

Screening for Colon Cancer: Back Story ''One in every 17 of us will have colon cancer in our lifetime,"" says David Ahlquist, MD, professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., who presented his findings on the new colon cancer screening test. Although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the U.S., many adults don't undergo the screenings once they reach age 50 (or earlier for those with a family history), Ahlquist told a news conference. Estimates of how many adults undergo screening vary, but Ahlquist says probably only 40% adhere to the screening schedule over time. One screening test, the colonoscopy, in which a flexible, lighted tube with a video camera is inserted to examine the colon, requires dietary restriction and preparation of the colon. Patients must often take time off work and need transportation home from the procedure.",1

SUNDAY, Oct. 24, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Bitter taste receptors are located in the lungs as well as on the tongue, a finding that might lead to improved treatments for asthma and other obstructive lung diseases, according to researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore.

""The detection of functioning taste receptors on smooth muscle of the bronchus in the lungs was so unexpected that we were at first quite skeptical ourselves,"" said the study's senior author, Dr. Stephen B. Liggett, professor of medicine and physiology and director of the university's cardiopulmonary genomics program, in a university news release.

The receptors in the lungs -- which the team found by accident in an unrelated study -- are the same as those on the tongue. But the tongue's receptors are clustered in taste buds that send signals to the brain, while the receptors in the lungs are not grouped in buds and don't send signals to the brain, explained the research team. However, they still respond to bitter tastes.

The researchers tested different bitter compounds on human and mouse airways, individual airway smooth muscle cells, and on mice with asthma. They found that these compounds all opened lung airways more profoundly than current drugs.

The study appears online Oct. 24 in the journal Nature Medicine.

""New drugs to treat asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis are needed. This could replace or enhance what is now in use, and represents a completely new approach,"" said Liggett.

But, he added, simply eating bitter-tasting foods or compounds won't help people with asthma.

""Based on our research, we think that the best drugs would be chemical modifications of bitter compounds, which would be aerosolized and then inhaled into the lungs with an inhaler,"" he said.

The research, which is preliminary, was supported by grants from the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

MONDAY, Oct. 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- One of the world's most ubiquitous and pedestrian drugs -- aspirin -- may cut the risk of dying for men who have prostate cancer that has not yet spread beyond the gland, a new study suggests.

In looking at the records of more than 5,000 men with prostate cancer, 2,000 of whom were taking aspirin or another blood-thinning drug, researchers presenting at the annual meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in San Diego report that the risk of dying from the cancer was reduced by more than half.

""We show that patients taking anticoagulant [blood thinning] medication had better outcomes with regards to prostate cancer death and that this benefit was most prominent in patients who had high-risk disease,"" said study lead author Dr. Kevin Choe, a radiation oncologist with the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas. High-risk tumors are more aggressive and thus more likely to eventually kill the patient.

Choe spoke at a Monday ASTRO teleconference.

Of the blood thinners used in the study, aspirin was the one which seemed to account for most of the benefit, the researchers said

There has already been some evidence that cancer and the body's coagulation system might be linked in some way.

""Cancer patients tend to develop clots in their legs and lungs more frequently and also patients who develop clots in their legs and lungs tend to develop cancer more frequently,"" Choe noted. ""We hypothesized that anticoagulant medication may lower the chance of death from prostate cancer in men who have localized prostate cancer.""

And, at least according to this retrospective review of medical records, this did indeed appear to be the case. Retrospective studies -- where researchers look back over previously collected data, looking for associations -- are not as reliable as prospective trials, however.

The study included 5,275 men diagnosed with prostate cancer that had not yet spread beyond the prostate gland and had been treated with surgery or radiation. Of the almost 2,000 patients on anticoagulants in the study, 1,649 were taking aspirin, 428 warfarin, 287 clopidogrel (Plavix), 26 enoxaparin, and 408 a combination of blood thinners.

After an average follow-up of about seven years, only 1 percent of men who had been taking an anticoagulant had died versus 4 percent of those in the control group. At 10 years, 4 percent of those taking one of these medications had died versus 10 percent in no-blood thinner group.

This translates to a risk reduction of about 50 percent, the researchers calculated.

The chances of the cancer spreading to the bone were reduced while PSA (prostate-specific antigen) blood levels -- thought to be a marker for cancer's advance -- were also better controlled.

""This benefit was seen whether these patients were treated with surgery or radiotherapy,"" Choe added.

Cancer cells are coated by platelets when they enter the bloodstream and are on their way to spreading. This protects them from immune cells and also helps them stick to their next location, Choe explained. Anticoagulants may work by interfering with this process.

But Choe said he is not ready to recommend routine aspirin use in men diagnosed with prostate cancer.

""It's premature to say that aspirin should be used in a standard-therapy way in all patients with prostate cancer,"" he said. ""But we may expect to see this benefit in those who are taking aspirin for other [usually cardiovascular] reasons.""

Aspirin also comes with some risks of its own, including stomach bleeding, Choe pointed out.

A second study, conducted in the United States, Canada and Great Britain and also being presented at ASTRO, suggests that a combination of hormone therapy plus radiation may be the best treatment for men who have locally advanced prostate cancer with a high risk of returning.

This usurps the previous view that hormone therapy was useless or even ""unkind or toxic,"" said study lead author Dr. Malcolm Mason, a radiation oncologist with Cardiff University in Wales.

This trial, the largest of its kind, involved about 1,200 men who were randomly chosen to receive hormone therapy alone or a combination of that and radiation.

An initial review at six years suggested that those taking the combination therapy had a 43 percent reduced risk of dying from prostate cancer, while side effects were not ""major,"" Mason said. ""If the figures from the interim analysis are similar to the final analysis, we would expect a 43 percent reduction in the chances of death from prostate cancer in men with this regimen,"" he said.

""We feel these results are practice changing,"" Mason added. ""The standard treatment for localized, high-risk prostate cancer for people who are fit for radiotherapy should be a combination of hormone therapy plus radiotherapy.""

Experts note that studies presented at scientific meetings do not face the same peer-review scrutiny as those published in reputable journals.

"Oct. 25, 2010 -- A dose of baking soda may add a little fizz to the performance of tennis players, a new study says.

Scientists at the National Taiwan College of Physical Education conducted a small study to test whether a tiny amount of sodium bicarbonate -- more commonly known as baking soda -- helped tennis players do more than just take the smell out of their shoes.

It seemed to help performance, researchers say in the study, published in the Journal of the International Society of Sports Nutrition.

“We found that sodium bicarbonate supplementation can prevent the fatigue-induced decline in skilled tennis performance seen during matches,” Chen-Kang Chang, head of the Taiwanese research team, says in a news release. “The service and forehand ground stroke consistency was maintained” after a simulated match in a trial in which sodium bicarbonate was used.",0
"The findings were released at a news briefing held in advance of the annual meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in San Diego.

But if the findings are confirmed, ""patients who are taking aspirin for other reasons may see an added benefit,"" says study head Kevin Choe, MD, a radiation oncologist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical School in Dallas.

Researchers stress the findings are preliminary and that men with the cancer should not reach for the aspirin bottle in an attempt to improve their health.

Oct. 25, 2010 -- Aspirin , already linked in some studies to a lower risk of developing colon cancer , may also cut the risk of dying of prostate cancer by more than half, a large study suggests.

Blood Clot-Cancer Link

Studies have shown that people with cancer are more prone to blood clots and that people with blood clots are at increased risk of cancer. Also, lab and animal studies suggest drugs that anticlotting drugs like aspirin may interfere with cancer growth and spread. So Choe and colleagues hypothesized that anticlotting drugs may lower the risk of dying among men with prostate cancer.

The study involved 5,275 men with localized cancer whose disease had not spread beyond the prostate gland; 1,982 of the men were taking anticlotting medications: aspirin, Lovenox, Plavix, and/or warfarin.

By 10 years after diagnosis, 10% of men not taking one of these medications had died from prostate cancer vs. 4% of those who took an anticlotting medication.

The risk that cancer spread was also reduced by anticlotting medications, from 7% to 3%. Also, 43% of men who didn’t take anticlotting medications had a recurrence of their cancer, compared with 33% of men who did take them.

Men who took aspirin gained the greatest benefit, Choe says.

Harvard Medical School's Anthony Zietman, MD, president of ASTRO, tells WebMD that the findings are intriguing. However, they need to be confirmed, and the optimal dose, timing, and duration of use needs to be worked out, he says.

Aspirin and other anticlotting medications carry risks of their own, chiefly bleeding, Zietman says.

""We have to be sure the benefits outweigh the risks before we recommend this to patients.""

This study was presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the ""peer review"" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.",1
"He said more research was needed, but for now, “I think the market is running way out in front of the science.”

Scientists agree that DHA, naturally transmitted to a fetus through the placenta in the last half of pregnancy, is important, probably to visual and brain development. Several studies indicate that babies born prematurely receive too little DHA, and some studies have found that premature babies fed DHA after birth show better cognitive performance or visual coordination later on than preemies who aren’t given DHA.

But the new study, which mainly assessed full-term babies, found no cognitive difference at 18 months whether mothers received DHA supplements or placebos. The lead researcher, Dr. Maria Makrides of the University of Adelaide in Australia, said this suggested that full-term babies already get enough DHA in the womb, and that “there’s no extra boost” from getting more.

Nonetheless, several experts said they would continue to support taking DHA in pregnancy, especially since it is safe and apparently has few downsides. They cited a smaller 2003 Norwegian study that found I.Q. increases at age 4, although no cognitive benefit was seen in infants or 7-year-olds.

View all New York Times newsletters.

That study’s lead author, Dr. Ingrid Helland of Oslo University Hospital, said that perhaps the benefit shown at age 4 existed at 7 but was difficult to identify amid other developmental factors. She said babies in her study might have received more DHA than those in this study. Dr. Oken said the new study might have shown no benefit in 18-month-olds because effects in infants might be “hard to measure” or “it may be that the benefit of DHA is not as important as when you’re 4.”

Dr. Makrides’s team plans assessments at 4 and 7. Dr. Jatinder Bhatia, a neonatologist heading the nutrition committee of the American Academy of Pediatrics, said that unless further studies showed no benefit as children got older, he would continue recommending DHA, now in many prenatal vitamins, because “I’m not convinced at this time that we should reverse course.”

Much about DHA is unknown. Its effect in supplements for children and adults is being studied, as well as whether supplements offer the same benefit as DHA-rich fish, like salmon.

Some studies, including the new report, suggest DHA supplementation in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of premature birth. And the new study showed small reductions in postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression. Dr. Scott Stuart, a University of Iowa psychiatry and psychology professor, said his pregnant patients with mild to moderate depression had improved when taking DHA while seeing a counselor.

“There’s no harm that we know of at all, in contrast to many antidepressants,” he said. “And it might be of some help.”",1
"Oct. 18, 2010 -- Vitamin B12 may help protect the brain against Alzheimer's disease, according to new evidence that suggests the vitamin and an amino acid called homocysteine may both be involved in the development of Alzheimer’s.

High levels of vitamin B12 in the blood are already known to help reduce levels of homocysteine, which has been linked to an increased risk of Alzheimer's disease, memory loss, and stroke. But researchers say the relationship between homocysteine and vitamin B12 levels and Alzheimer's disease risk has been unclear.

The seven-year study followed 271 Finnish people ages 65 to 79 who did not have any symptoms of Alzheimer's disease at the start of the study.

During the study, published in Neurology, 17 people developed Alzheimer’s disease. Researchers found that each picomolar increase in blood vitamin B12 level was associated with a 2% reduction in the risk of Alzheimer's disease among the elderly.

In addition, each micromolar increase in blood homocysteine level raised the risk of Alzheimer's disease by 16%.

Blood levels of folate, another nutrient believed to lower homocysteine levels, were not linked to Alzheimer's disease risk.

“Our findings show the need for further research on the role of vitamin B12 as a marker for identifying people who are at increased risk of Alzheimer’s disease,” says researcher Babak Hooshmand, MD, MSc, with Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, in a news release. “Low levels of vitamin B12 are surprisingly common in the elderly.""

""The few studies that have investigated the usefulness of vitamin B12 supplements to reduce the risk of memory loss have had mixed results,” says Hooshmand.

Common dietary sources of vitamin B12 include fish, poultry, and meat products.",1
"Oct. 18, 2010 -- An analysis of 22 studies involving about 2.5 million people shows a significant association between using cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins and a reduced risk for colorectal cancer.

The analysis shows there was a 12% reduction of colorectal cancer risk among statin users. Also, the longer patients used statin drugs, the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer.

The findings are based on a review of 22 studies published through October 2009 and were presented at the American College of Gastroenterology's (ACG) 75th Annual Scientific meeting in San Antonio.

Study researcher N. Jewel Samadder, MD, MSc, from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says the relationship between statin use and a reduction in risk for colorectal cancer was consistent across various study designs.

“This effect was largely consistent across study design with both case control and cohort studies showing a strong correlation,” he says in a news release. “The length of statin use, both greater than six months and greater than five years of use was associated with reduction in colorectal cancer risk.”

The group of statins that showed the greatest effect in reducing risk are classified as lipophilic: atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altocor, Altoprev, Mevacor), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor),

Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the U.S.; 102,900 new cases of colon cancer are diagnosed in men and women every year, and about 39,670 new cases of rectal cancer are diagnosed annually.

The relationship between statins and cancer is unclear, but other research exploring the impact of statins at the molecular level suggests that these cholesterol-lowering drugs may help control the development of tumor, as well as tumor growth.

“Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,” says Samadder in the news release. “Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted.”

This study was presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the ""peer review"" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Statin drugs may lower the risk of colon cancer by as much as 12 percent, U.S. researchers reported on Monday.

The longer people took the highly popular cholesterol-lowering pills, the lower their risk of later developing colon cancer, the researchers told a meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology.

Many researchers have found that statin drugs, which include Pfizer Inc’s Lipitor and AstraZeneca Plc’s Crestor, have effects far beyond lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart disease.

“Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,” said Dr. Jewel Samadder of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, who led the study.

“Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted,” Samadder added in a statement.

Samadder’s team did what is known as a meta-analysis, combining the findings of 22 scientific studies with more than 2.5 million volunteers.

Overall, patients who took statins had a 12 percent lower risk of being diagnosed with colon cancer than people who did not take the drugs, they found.

Statins are not risk-free. In May, British researchers reported that patients taking them have a higher risks of liver dysfunction, kidney failure, muscle weakness and cataracts.

And U.S. health officials have been watching data that suggests some statins such as Merck & Co’s blockbuster drug Vytorin may actually raise the risk of cancer, although they have saidf this is unlikely.",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Viagra, developed to help ailing hearts long before it got a more high-profile job fighting erectile dysfunction, might help treat heart symptoms of muscular dystrophy, researchers reported on Monday.

A box of Viagra, typically used to treat erectile dysfunction, is seen in a pharmacy in Toronto January 31, 2008. REUTERS/Mark Blinch

Tests in mice genetically engineered to have a condition similar to Duchenne muscular dystrophy showed the drug could improve how the heart works, Joseph Beavoa of the University of Washington and colleagues at the University of North Carolina found.

It is not clear just how the drug is helping the mice, they reported in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, but they said it may be worth trying it as a treatment for muscular dystrophy.

Duchenne muscular dystrophy affects an estimated one in 3,500 males, according to the National Institutes of Health.

“Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) is a progressive and fatal genetic disorder of muscle degeneration. Patients with DMD lack expression of the protein dystrophin as a result of mutations in the X-linked dystrophin gene,” the researchers wrote.

Because of the involvement of the X chromosome, boys are far more likely to be affected than girls, who have two copies of the X chromosome and, thus, are likely to have a “spare” copy of the healthy gene.

Muscles all over the body break down as the patient grows up, the heart included. Many patients die of heart failure and most patients with the condition die before age 40.

Viagra, known generically as sildenafil, is sold by Pfizer Inc for erectile dysfunction and under the brand name Revatio to treat a heart condition called pulmonary hypertension. It is in a class of drugs called PDE5 inhibitors that work in a variety of ways to increase blood flow.

The team, working with funds from the NIH and non-profit groups, tested Viagra in mice that had heart damage similar to that seen in muscular dystrophy.

It slowed the damage and in some cases reversed it, they found.

“Although PDE5 inhibitors will certainly not cure DMD, the current studies suggest that they could be used in combination with current or future therapies,” the researchers wrote.",1
"Oct. 17, 2010 -- Women aged 65 and older are advised to undergo bone mineral density (BMD) screening every two years, but those with normal results at age 67 may be able to wait 10 years before their next screening test, a new study suggests.

Researchers say the 10-year interval is OK because the women’s risk of developing the brittle bone disease osteoporosis in that time is low.

The new findings are slated to be presented at the annual meeting of the American Society for Bone Mineral Research in Toronto.

""If a woman's bone density at age 67 is very good, then she doesn't need to be re-screened in two years or three years, because we're not likely to see much change,"" says study author Margaret L. Gourlay, MD, MPH, of the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, in a news release. ""Our study found it would take about 16 years for 10 percent of women in the highest bone density ranges to develop osteoporosis. That was longer than we expected, and it's great news for this group of women.""

Researchers analyzed bone mineral density data from 5,035 women aged 67 or older who had their BMD tested at least twice during the 15-year study period. Their findings are based on the women's T-score, which is a measure of bone density.",1

SATURDAY, Oct. 15, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- People suffering from a disfiguring loss of bone in the jaw may find help in the form of a long-used osteoporosis drug, two new studies suggest.

Besides being linked to chronic, severe gum disease, this type of bone loss has also been connected in rare cases to the use of bisphosphonates, a different class of osteoporosis drugs.

But the two papers in the Oct. 16 online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine report success with teriparatide (Forteo) in rebuilding bone.

One report describes the case of an 88-year-old woman who had been taking the bisphosphonate alendronate (Fosamax) since suffering a hip fracture 10 years earlier. She had also been taking the corticosteroid prednisone for two decades.

Experts have already noticed an uptick in the incidence of this rare but devastating condition in patients using bisphosphonates.

According to an editorial accompanying the study, this complication occurs in about 5 percent of cancer patients who are taking a high-dose bisphosphonate (Zometa or Aredia) to control or prevent spread of malignancy to the bone. It is much rarer in people who take a lower-dose bisphosphonate (such as Actonel, Boniva or Fosamax) for osteoporosis.

The 88-year-old woman described in the journal report had been experiencing pain in her jaw for a year and was subsequently diagnosed with osteonecrosis, a debilitating ""death"" of bone due to loss of blood flow.

After eight weeks of treatment with Forteo, though, the pain went away and the osteonecrosis resolved, reported the authors, from Austin Health in Melbourne, Australia.

The editorial pointed out, however, that Forteo should not be used in patients whose cancer has already spread to the bone, as it might prompt even more spread.

It's also possible that the corticosteroid therapy she was taking could have contributed to the woman's bone loss, the authors stated.

The second paper involved 40 patients with severe gum disease that had affected their jaws, all of whom first underwent surgery on their jaw. They were then randomized to receive either Forteo or a placebo. All participants took calcium and vitamin D as well.

""These were patients with severe periodontal disease but who were otherwise systemically healthy,"" said study senior author Dr. Laurie K. McCauley, chair of the department of periodontic and oral medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.

After six weeks of therapy, patients in the Forteo arm saw greater healing of their jawbone and this continued throughout one year of follow-up.

""There was a significant improvement in clinical measures of gum and bone,"" McCauley stated.

But, she pointed out, Forteo is not yet approved for this indication, so ""we can't recommend it next week.""

Right now, a bone graft is probably the most common type of therapy for this type of bone loss, she said.

""I think that it's really an important important proof-of-concept that you can inject locally and get a response,"" said Dr. Rena D'Souza, chair of biomedical sciences at Texas A&M Health Science Center Baylor College of Dentistry in Dallas. ""We could not only use this approach for the treatment of periodontal disease where the disease enters the bone and gum. but also other forms of periodontal disease.""

""Bisphosphonates cut back on blood flow and blood vessels so that cancer doesn't have a chance,"" she said. ""That is why it's used very effectively for cancer but if you happen to injure the bone or take out a tooth you really need the blood vessels. The bone cells don't have the ability to lay down new bone.""

THURSDAY, Oct. 14, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- With the aim of catching autism in children at an earlier age than currently possible, scientists are exploring the potential of using MRI scans as a screening tool.

The current effort, focused on patients already diagnosed with autism, used MRIs to locate areas of the brain where the left and right hemispheres do not communicate properly. These so-called ""hot spots"" are central to motor function, attention, facial recognition and social behavior -- types of behaviors that are abnormal in people with autism.

""We know the two hemispheres must work together for many brain functions,"" study author Dr. Jeffrey S. Anderson, an assistant professor of radiology at the University of Utah, said in a news release. ""We used MRI to look at the strength of these connections from one side to the other in autism patients.""

Using MRI imaging, the team searched for differences in brain activity patterns in the microstructure of white matter tissue in 80 autism patients between the ages of 10 and 35. This tissue, the authors noted, is known to play a role in communication between various brain regions.

Communication deficits between the two hemispheres of the brain were, in fact, uncovered by MRI scans -- differences that the team said were not found in the brains of people without autism.

The authors also noted that apart from an increased brain size among children diagnosed with autism, there are no apparent structural differences between the brains of autistic patients and patients who are not autistic.

Anderson and his colleagues, who reported no conflicts of interest, published their findings in the Oct. 15 online issue of Cerebral Cortex.

Information from this investigation will be pooled with those of another ongoing long-term study, which is tracking brain activity among an additional 100 autism patients.

""We still don't know precisely what's going on in the brain in autism,"" co-author Dr. Janet Lainhart, an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics, acknowledged in the news release from Cerebral Cortex.

""[But] this work adds an important piece of information to the autism puzzle,"" she said. ""It adds evidence of functional impairment in brain connectivity in autism and brings us a step closer to a better understanding of this disorder. When you understand it at a biological level, you can envision how the disorder develops, what are the factors that cause it, and how can we change it.""

The study was limited to high-functioning males and so did not allow researchers to generalize the findings to females, younger children, or ""lower functioning"" individuals with autism, the researchers wrote.

For her part, Laura Bono, the Durham, N.C.-based former chair of the National Autism Association and member of the board of directors of the autism advocacy group ""Safe Minds,"" expressed a certain amount of hesitancy about the prospects for MRI-driven diagnoses.

""I'm always glad to see there's more autism research underway, and there's certainly no risk to having an MRI,"" she said. ""But my question here is, 'Is there a real benefit?'""

""I would say that if this is geared to, or opens up, any specific avenue to targeted therapy that can help left and right brain communication among certain children for whom that's the pathway to autism, then it should certainly be explored,"" Bono said. ""But I do not see this as being about diagnosis, because we know that you're not going to screen 100 percent of children this way. Knowing that diagnosing autism is about looking for certain behaviors, only children already identified as having issues that might be a function of autism would be screened.""

""So if there's no targeted treatment to follow up on the results of this kind of scan, then it's just another expensive test for parents who are already barraged with so many tests at diagnosis,"" she said. ""And in that case, I see this as just a waste of money.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - A protein in urine could be a strong indicator of prostate cancer risk, according to British scientists who say their findings could one day be developed into a quick and simple test for the disease.

Scientists from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) said the protein, called microseminoprotein-beta or MSMB, is found at reduced levels in men diagnosed with the disease and are also lower in men with more aggressive forms of the cancer.

“The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,” said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study.

Whitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors.

Prostate cancer killed an estimated 258,000 men around the world in 2008 and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease.

The most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen (PSA). But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment.

A U.S. study published last year found that routine PSA prostate screening has resulted in more than one million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.

“At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,” said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study.

The protein — which regulates prostate cell death — is produced by normal prostate cells.

The scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels.

The results, published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) ONE journal, showed that MSMB is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease. They also showed men with aggressive tumors were also likely to have lower levels of the protein in their urine.

Commenting on the study, Kate Holmes of the UK’s Prostate Cancer Charity, said they could prove very valuable in future.

“Given the known limitations of the PSA blood test, finding a technique to accurately diagnose prostate cancer is the Holy Grail of research into the disease,” she said in a statement.

“An accurate, reliable urine test for prostate cancer would be an invaluable tool if it is proven to be successful on a large scale.”",1
"For men with advanced prostate cancer, the news for decades has been mostly bleak. Until recently, only two treatments had been shown to prolong survival.

Abiraterone has emerged as a potential third new treatment for prostate cancer following approval earlier this year of Jevtana, a chemotherapy agent, and Provenge, a cancer vaccine (above).

Researchers reported Monday that the drug abiraterone, being developed by Johnson & Johnson, extended survival by an average of 3.9 months among men with cancer that has spread beyond the prostate and for whom other treatments have failed. Among men, prostate cancer is the second-leading cancer killer, behind only lung cancer.

Johnson & Johnson plans to file for new-drug approval in the U.S. and Europe by year-end, raising prospects that the drug could be on the market next year. The drug, a pill, works by blocking production of hormones that fuel prostate tumors.

The abiraterone study, presented at the European Society for Medical Oncology meeting in Milan, follows approval earlier this year of two other therapies—Jevtana, a chemotherapy agent from Sanofi-Aventis SA, and Provenge, a cancer vaccine developed by Dendreon Inc., which marshals the immune system to fight the disease.

""When you have drugs that act in different ways and each is giving some measurable benefit, that is significant progress in a field where new agents have come along very rarely in the past,"" says Steve K. Clinton, director of prostate and genitourinary oncology at Ohio State University's James Cancer Hospital and Research Institute, Columbus. Dr. Clinton wasn't involved in the current study and doesn't have consulting relationships with the companies.

Still, the overall improvement is modest for each therapy. Jevtana increased survival by an average of 2.4 months compared with standard chemotherapy. Provenge added an average of 4.1 months of life. Researchers say the results are impressive nevertheless because the studies involved patients whose tumors progressed after treatment with several different therapies.

""These drugs are first tested in dying patients with no other therapy options and with months to live,"" says Johann de Bono, a researcher at the Institute of Cancer Research and Royal Marsden Hospital in London. The hope, as with treatments for many cancers, is that they will lead to much longer survival when studied in patients with early-stage disease.

Jevtana Sanofi-Aventis U.S

The abiraterone study involved 1,195 patients from 13 countries whose disease was considered ""castration resistant,"" meaning it had progressed despite surgery or drugs to shut down production of the androgen hormone testosterone. The patients had also failed chemotherapy.

The 797 patients randomly assigned to abiraterone plus the steroid prednisone lived on average 14.8 months compared with 10.9 months for those treated with the steroid plus a placebo. The trial was stopped early after an interim data check determined the drug's benefit, enabling those on placebo to convert to the treatment.

Abiraterone patients were more likely than those on placebo to experience side effects such as an increase in blood pressure and retention of fluids. But they didn't lose their hair or have an increased risk of infection—problems associated with conventional chemotherapy.

Androgen hormones, particularly testosterone, fuel prostate tumors. Conventional hormone therapy blocks androgens produced by the testes. Abiraterone appears to target androgens also produced elsewhere, even by the tumors themselves, said Dr. de Bono, who presented the study in Milan. ""These tumors are their own androgen factories.""

Assuming abiraterone wins regulatory approval, oncologists will have to work out how it fits with the other new remedies. ""What we really need that we don't have at the moment is the wisdom to know which one to use at what time and in what order,"" Dr. Clinton says.

Cost could be a factor. The three-treatment Provenge regimen has been controversial partly because of the $93,000 cost. Dendreon has said treatment costs are comparable with chemotherapy if total costs of care are taken into account.

Chadi Nabhan, division director of hemotology/oncology at Advocate Lutheran General Hospital, Park Ridge, Ill., and an investigator on Provenge studies, says he doesn't see the treatments as rivals. It is possible that by giving one treatment after the other, doctors will be able to extend life beyond what's possible with one strategy alone, he said.

"BOSTON/CHICAGO (Reuters) - In September 2007, Verna Schrombeck gathered three of her six children — those who could bear it — to discuss her funeral arrangements. She had been given just months to live and was about to undergo a last-ditch, cutting-edge heart surgery. There was no guarantee she would return home.

Had she organized things well enough, she wondered, so that her eldest son, who was in charge of the estate, would not be burdened? Had she taught her handicapped son, an adult, enough life skills to take care of himself? She asked that the Ave Maria be played at her funeral.

A week later, Verna’s sister drove her 8 hours from Lowell, Indiana to Rochester, Minnesota, to the Mayo Clinic, one of the country’s best hospitals for heart surgery. Her daughter flew in from Kansas. By the time Verna arrived at the hospital she could barely walk to the admissions desk. “I leaned over the railing, gasping for breath,” she said. “I told my daughter, “you have to get me a wheelchair.”

Verna, now 78, was suffering from heart failure, a progressive condition that, in its advanced stages, makes walking even a few feet difficult. She had received multiple treatments, including drugs and an implantable heart defibrillator, but nothing was working. In a final Hail Mary, doctors decided to implant an experimental, battery-powered mechanical heart pump known as a left ventricular assist device, or LVAD, into a cavity in her abdomen to assist her heart in pumping.

By the time she returned home, Verna, who received the device as part of a clinical trial, was able to dispense with her oxygen tank and take on household chores. Three years later, she is teaching piano to her five great-grandchildren, cooking meals for her family and driving by herself.

“It has transformed me,” she said.

The device, called HeartMate II and made by Thoratec Corp, was approved by U.S. health regulators in 2008 to keep patients alive while they waited for a heart transplant. But in January, it was approved for permanent use in patients who are ineligible for a transplant, expanding the number of potential recipients from a few thousand to tens of thousands, and potentially changing the landscape for the treatment of end-stage heart failure.

“There has been a ten-fold increase in the use of these devices since they were approved for permanent use,” said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, Professor of Medicine at Harvard Medical School and director, Cardiomyopathy and Heart Failure at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston. “We are going to know a lot more a year from now but my anticipation is that it will have been the approval of this device in January that will have really set the field in motion.”

To survive, patients must be connected to a lead called a drive-line that runs from the LVAD out through the skin and to a power source. At night the drive-line is plugged into a base unit with a display screen that provides statistical data, which in turn is plugged into a wall socket. By day patients are powered by a set of rechargeable batteries, weighing six or seven pounds, that can be carried around in a bag, holster or vest. The batteries are connected to a controller the size of a paperback book that can be worn on a belt around the waist.

“We like to say I’m bionic,” said Geri Norris, 63, a native of Bristol, England who now lives with her husband in Marlborough, Massachusetts.

She is one of the new crop of patients who will live with the device indefinitely. One big drawback, she jokes, is not being able to wear the clothes she likes.

“This is not exactly a fashion statement,” she said ruefully, plucking at the light-blue L.L. Bean fishing vest that carries her equipment.

While powered by battery, patients can go about much of their daily lives. But being plugged into the wall at night, albeit with a cord long enough for a trip to the bathroom, takes some getting used to.

“You know how they tether dogs to a clothes line?” said Norris, with a laugh. “That’s what it feels like.”

AN UNNATURAL DEATH

The rise in use of mechanical heart devices represents a dramatic leap forward in the treatment of heart failure. But it also raises some potentially troubling ethical questions: these machines have the capacity to extend life beyond its natural cycle and beyond what might be desirable.

“This is one of the ways our technology has moved ahead of our humanity,” said Stevenson. “We haven’t had enough experience yet about how to help people die naturally who have a ventricular assist device. And I can tell you, it is difficult to die with one of these things in place. The body does not give up easily when the blood flow is maintained.”

Not that patients don’t die. Infections are a fairly common cause of death, as are bleeding and stroke. But death may not always come naturally. And decisions must be made about turning the device off.

“We have to address what is the meaning of death on one of these pumps,” said Dr. Valluvan Jeevanandam, chief of cardiac and thoracic surgery at the University of Chicago Medical Center and an investigator for Thoratec’s clinical trials.

Roughly 70 percent of patients on the HeartMate II were alive after a year, and nearly 60 percent were alive after two years, according to the latest data.

“It’s not hard to imagine a person who has had severe stroke that has impacted both sides of the brain, the kidneys are shutting down, he is on a respirator, but yet the LVAD just keeps churning along,” said Martin Smith, a clinical ethicist at the Cleveland Clinic.

Under U.S. law, patients are allowed to ask that implanted devices be turned off. But Dr. Diane Meier, a professor in the department of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine, said cardiologists are particularly bad at preparing patients for death, especially this kind of death.

“The number of consults that the palliative team gets from cardiologists can be measured on one hand,” she said. “We are called upon much more frequently by physicians in other disciplines.”

HOLY GRAIL

Still, LVADs are improving the quality of life for hundreds of patients, including Dick Cheney, the former vice president of the United States and a multiple heart attack survivor. Moreover, the importance of LVAD technology goes beyond its impact on existing patients. It provides a platform for research into stem cell and other therapies designed to regenerate a patient’s own heart.

“The Holy Grail is for a sick patient to get a pump, which immediately helps,” said Dr. Randall Starling, Head of Heart Failure and Cardiac Transplant Medicine at the Cleveland Clinic. “Then we inject his own stem cells — maybe in one shot or over the course of a year — then he improves and his heart recovers, and then he has the pump removed.”

LVADs have made regenerative therapy research — the new science that uses stem cells to generate new organs and tissue — much easier, since the risk of hurting a patient is minimal. The LVAD carries out the heart’s main pumping function, no matter what research is conducted on the patient’s own heart. Once the patient undergoes a transplant, the treated native heart, with its cells and its genes, can be examined and studied.

“In five years, we will have some fairly substantial number of patients treated and followed for a couple of years,” said Dr. Leslie W. Miller, director of the University of South Florida’s Cardiovascular Clinical and Research Integrated Strategic Program.

These advances may never materialize, or they could be years down the road. Even so, early data have proved promising and young patients who are scheduled to receive a transplant might consider postponing the procedure, which is irreversible, Miller said.

“Maybe a mechanical pump is a better five to 10 year solution for these people because we hope to be in a better place by that time with stem cell technology and other regenerative models,” he said. “Transplant survival at one year is 85 to 88 percent, and 60 to 65 percent at five years, and I think we can have these kind of figures with these devices.”

CRAZY ROBOTIC HEART

Daniel Roth, who just turned 23, is one of the young people faced with such a decision. Since receiving his LVAD a year and a half ago, he has lived an active life. He works in a hospital, exercises and plays in a rock band — Teamwork. He is determined to get a transplant.

“I could wait five years and hope stem cell therapy will work but by then I’m nearly 30 and I have things I want to do,” he said. “I want to be a musician, and go on tour. I would sacrifice some years off the end of my life — not too many — for the years left to be as awesome as they can be.”

Roth says he has been told transplant patients can expect to live 20 to 25 years, but Dr. Mark Slaughter, professor and chief of the division of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the University of Louisville is not so sanguine.

“The survival rate at one year is more than 80 percent,” he said, “but after that there is a 4 percent decline every year, so that in 20 years everyone is dead. You have a very finite timeline.”

Roth, who lives with his parents in Norwood, Massachusetts, became ill in late 2006 with stomach pains and shortness of breath, while studying marine biology at Roger Williams University in Rhode Island. In January, 2007, he had a stroke. He was diagnosed with an enlarged heart and placed on the list for a transplant.

For the next two years he returned repeatedly to the hospital with symptoms such as vomiting, fluid retention and shortness of breath. A defibrillator was implanted.

“I became very depressed and docile,” said Roth, who these days brims with optimism and energy. “Playing in my band took every last ounce of strength.”

He struggled on, with medications, but in early 2009 he caught a stomach bug that he could not shake. He returned to the hospital. While there, his heart stopped.

“He coded for about six minutes,” said his mother, Ellen, tearfully.

Emergency workers revived him, but by that time he was too ill for transplant surgery.

Even if he had been physically fitter, there is no guarantee a donor heart would have been available. It is estimated that some 50,000 people around the world are candidates for heart transplant, but only 5,000 patients per year get them.

“The only option for me was this crazy robotic heart,” he said. It was implanted in April 2009.

“That summer was amazing,” he said. “I traveled with my band, I did everything. I didn’t realize how sick I was until I got this thing.”

Now he is eligible once again for a transplant. And he wants one. He wants to be free of the encumbrances of the LVAD, the endless changing of the batteries, the fear that the wiring might “crap out,” that a power outage might hit. He remembers vividly a fourth of July weekend away with friends in Maine. A fuse in the old house they were staying in blew and cut all power. “It was like a bad movie, where the clock starts ticking on your life,” he said.

A flurry of calls to doctors and nearby hospitals led him to Maine Medical Center in Portland, which had an extra base unit. But he fears that if he is on tour in a remote part of the country, or overseas, he may not be so lucky.

To get his heart transplant, Roth needs to manage his weight — one of his biggest challenges — since one of the criteria for matching a donor heart with a recipient is weight class. A heart donated by a 150-pound woman won’t support a 280-pound man.

“I’m doing well now, I’ve lost 25 pounds, and after the transplant I’ll be an angel,” he said ebulliently.

EXPANDING MARKET

In addition to regenerative medicine coming down the pike, new generations of LVADs are also in development.

The HeartMate II is a third-generation device and a vast improvement over its predecessor, the HeartMate XVE, which was so large it could not be used in small women, and noisy enough to be disconcerting both to the patient and those around him.

Dan Mooney, who had a long history of heart attacks and had several bypass surgeries by the time he was 53, received a prior generation LVAD in early 2002 — shortly after 9/11 — and survived on it for about 14 months, according to his widow, Cathy. But people found him scary.

“He would get into an elevator, with his fishing vest and all these wires coming out, and he was ticking,” she said. “In public he scared people half to death.”

The HeartMate II, by contrast, is quiet. It pumps blood on a continuous basis, which eliminates the pulse.

Currently, the HeartMate II dominates the market. But a rival company, HeartWare International Inc, of Framingham, Massachusetts, is developing a smaller device that some experts believe could, if approved as expected by early 2012, gain significant market share and possibly eclipse the HeartMate II.

“I think the market overall is going to be very substantial, but I do think that ultimately HeartWare has a better product, so if that’s the case, why not try and bet on the best in class technology,” said Kris Jenner, a portfolio manager at T-Rowe Price Healthcare Sciences Fund. Jenner expects the market for ventricular assist devices to be worth as much as $1 billion in five years time.

Still, HeartWare CEO Douglas Godshall is cautious about building expectations too high.

“We have certain advantages over Thoratec — our device is smaller and can be placed in the chest rather than a pocket in the abdomen, which physicians like, and it’s a faster procedure,” he said. “But it is not an insignificant advantage to already have approval and be on the market and have had a chance to work out a lot of your kinks. We are just finding out what our kinks are.”

Larry Feinberg, who runs Oracle Investment Management and holds shares in Thoratec, said he believes both companies will be winners over the long term.

“I don’t think there will be one dominant player and the other falls by the wayside,” he said. “I see it more as being a pretty close horse race, with each technological advance causing each to leapfrog the other. There are very high expectations for HeartWare. If their data isn’t perfect the stock could get really slammed.”

Results of HeartWare’s pivotal ADVANCE Bridge-to-Transplant Trial will be presented at this year’s annual American Heart Association meeting in November and both physicians and Wall Street analysts expect positive results.

Estimates vary as to the ultimate number of people who could benefit from the device, with some predicting 30,000 and others more than 100,000.

How far the market expands will likely depend on whether the device is used to treat patients at an earlier stage of their disease, in the hope of staving off a worsening of symptoms. Stevenson, the Harvard professor, said there is a “spirited” debate occurring in the medical community about the merits of this.

“Risks that seem very reasonable for somebody who has a miserable quality of life at home may be less reasonable if we have somebody who doesn’t feel all that bad at home,” said Stevenson. “We don’t really have much data at all beyond two years. And we’re already finding some surprises that are not such happy news.”

In particular, she said, physicians are finding that there is more bleeding and a different kind of bleeding — much of it in the colon, stomach and nose — than seen with Thoratec’s earlier device, the HeartMate XVE.

“Right now we’re all waiting to see how much more that’s going to be,” she said.

Thoratec Chief Executive Gary Burbach said the company is studying the problem, which appears with the continuous flow pump technology and is thought to somehow cause a disruption in the complex blood clotting process. Thoratec will continue to develop its pumps based on the current technology, he said, and doctors can manage the bleeding with medication.

BREAKING FREE FROM THE WIRE

Experts agree that there will be an advantage to whichever company can dispense with the external drive-line so that the entire system, including batteries and controller, are beneath the skin and power is transmitted across the skin.

“I’m a believer that the percutaneous drive-line ultimately needs to go away,” said Slaughter, the University of Louisville professor who is co-principal investigator on HeartWare’s bridge-to-transplant trial.

Totally implantable LVAD technology — known as transcutaneous energy transmission systems (TETS) — are not new. But before being clinically useful the technology and battery life need to be improved, said Slaughter.

“If you wanted a TET system from which you could disconnect for 15 to 20 minutes a day, you could have one in six months,” he said.

That might give a patient the chance to jump in a shower but probably would not be worth the more complicated surgery. If a patient could be disconnected for two hours a day — enough to swim, relax in a hot tub, or be intimate with a partner — that could significantly increase their quality of life.

“If you want to be disconnected for one hour twice a day, I think that could be doable within the next two years,” Slaughter said.

Thoratec has its sights set on developing a totally implantable device, with no drive-line and longer-running batteries within five years, Burbach said.

It is still unclear how long the devices will keep patients alive. Experts say they could last as long as 10 years.

Verna Schrombeck, for one, has come to terms with the uncertainty. “There is a tranquility that one has,” she said. “You’ve fought your battles, and you’ve learned to accept life as it is now — lightning bugs, the fireflies, the deer that come up and stand on their hind legs as they grab the apples. We don’t know where this is going to lead. But that’s true of everyone’s life.” (Reporting by Toni Clarke and Debra Sherman; Editing by Jim Impoco and Claudia Parsons)",1
"Oct. 12, 2010 -- Even when medical or surgical castration fails, a potent drug extends survival by four months in patients with metastatic prostate cancer.

The drug is Johnson & Johnson's abiraterone acetate. It blocks an enzyme crucial to the production of male hormones, which spur the growth and spread of advanced prostate cancers.

The treatment gave patients with metastatic, castration-resistant prostate cancer only an extra four months of life. But there's more hope than that from the study of some 1,200 men with late-stage cancer at 147 medical centers in 13 nations. The study was funded by Johnson & Johnson, which is developing the drug.

It appears that abiraterone is able to shut down androgen production not only in the testes, but also from the adrenal gland and from within prostate tumors themselves.

And while the average patient survived only four months longer than those on standard chemotherapy -- 14.8 months vs. 10.9 months -- some patients did much better.

""A key question now is to work out which patients will benefit from the drug -- clearly, some patients do and some don't,"" Johann de Bono, MD, PhD, of the U.K.'s Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, says in a news release.

De Bono reported the study findings in at this week's meeting of the European Society for Medical Oncology in Milan, Italy.

This study was presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the ""peer review"" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.",0
"Some 68% of the country is either overweight or obese, but there's not much clinical evidence on the best way to lose weight, outside of research on bariatric surgery. (True, ""Eat less and exercise more"" is great advice if you can manage to follow it, but public-health authorities have repeated that line until they're blue in the face and as a population we've only gotten fatter.)

Research presented over the weekend at the annual meeting of the Obesity Society and published online in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests a few specific strategies that may help -- namely making a commercial weight-loss program, including packaged foods, free.

In the study, some 442 overweight or obese women were randomly assigned to the Jenny Craig weight-loss program with once-weekly face-to-face counseling sessions, to the same program with weekly phone counseling or to a control group that received ""usual care,"" i.e. publicly available materials on diet and exercise. The two groups using the program also got $25 payments for every 6-month clinic visit to assess weight and other measurements. Jenny Craig, a unit of Nestlé, funded the research.

After two years, the in-person group had lost an average of 16.3 pounds, the phone group lost 13.6 pounds and the control group lost 4.4 pounds.

In the editorial accompanying the study, Rena Wing, a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at Brown University's Warren Alpert Medical School, writes the results suggest that if commercial weight-loss programs such as Jenny Craig were free to those who want to lose weight, ""both retention and average weight loss outcomes might be far better than when participants must pay for these programs."" The program costs about $1,600 for 12 weeks, she writes. Compare that to the $19,000 to $29,000 cost of bariatric surgery, which is often reimbursed by insurers.

(The countervailing theory is that people value things more when they pay for them, and that the mere act of ponying up $1,600 for three months of a diet program may make you take it more seriously.)

Wing calls for cost-effectiveness studies, conducted by researchers without any financial ties to the companies involved, that compare different commercial programs with each other. She also notes that more research on weight loss maintenance is needed, since the average weight loss was greater at one year than at the end of the study.

"Oct. 5, 2010 - Pregnant women who have up to two alcoholic drinks per week do not harm their children, a U.K. study shows.

More than 11,500 children and their mothers were included in the study. Mothers were first asked about their alcohol use when the kids were 9 months old. The children were last given a battery of behavioral and cognitive tests when they were 5 years of age.

Women were defined as light drinkers if they had no more than one or two drinks a week. A drink was defined as a very small glass of wine, a half pint of beer, or a small single measure of spirits, says study researcher Yvonne Kelly, PhD, of University College London.

""Our results suggest that children born to mothers who drank at low levels were not at any risk of social or emotional difficulties or any risk of emotional impairments compared to mothers who did not drink,"" Kelly tells WebMD.

""But that is a world away from recommending that expectant mothers should drink,"" Kelly is quick to add.

Indeed, many of the women included in the ""light drinkers"" group had no more than a drink or two during their entire pregnancy.

In the U.K., women are advised not to drink at all during the first trimester of their pregnancy and to drink no more than a drink or two a week after that.

In the U.S., pregnant women are strongly advised not to drink at all, says Eva Pressman, MD, director of maternal/fetal medicine at the University of Rochester, N.Y.

Pressman points out that women who are light drinkers during pregnancy tend to be from households with relatively high incomes. Children in high-income households tend to perform better on behavioral and cognitive tests -- which could mask some possible harms from their mothers' light drinking during pregnancy.

""What we tell women is that we don't know of a safe threshold for drinking alcohol during pregnancy. So our recommendation is not to consume any alcohol at all,"" Pressman tells WebMD.

The Kelly study appears in the Oct. 5 online issue of the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health.",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Researchers using a microscope and time-lapse photography believe they have developed a method for predicting which test-tube embryos are the most likely to develop properly, and are licensing development of a commercial test.

Their findings, published in the journal Nature Biotechnology, also provide some new insights into the development of days-old embryos, such as how babies inherit some genes from the mother and some from the father.

They said the new test could help fertility clinics pick the best embryo to implant in the womb.

This would save mothers from having several treatments and help improve on the current method of implanting multiple embryos to try to get one pregnancy and risk multiple births in the process.

“Our results shed light on human embryo development,” wrote Renee Reijo Pera of Stanford University in California and colleagues. “Our methods and algorithms may provide an approach for early diagnosis of embryo potential in assisted reproduction.”

So called test-tube babies are conceived by uniting egg and sperm in a lab dish and transferring the embryo into a woman’s uterus to develop. Most do not develop properly and labs have been looking for ways to improve their success rate.

Although it is not recommended, some IVF clinics will implant more than one embryo into the mother’s womb — leading to the birth of triplets, quadruplets and even more. Such babies almost always are born too early and face lifelong health problems.

All pregnancies are tenuous, even those achieved the old fashioned way. The March of Dimes, a charity founded to battle birth defects, estimates that as many as 50 percent of all pregnancies end in miscarriage — most often before a woman knows she is pregnant.

For the new test the researchers watched embryos divide and develop from the time sperm met egg in a lab dish. As the embryos split and grew, they also tested gene expression — looking at which genes activated, and when.

To their surprise, they found that almost from the very beginning some of the handful of cells had different sets of active genes.

An embryo’s fate — whether it would develop normally or not — seemed determined in many cases from the moment of conception and relied heavily on the mother’s egg cell, they found.

Embryos most likely to form a ball of cells called a blastocyst developed at a certain, measurable rate, they found.

Auxogyn, Inc., a privately held medical technology company, said in a statement it had acquired an exclusive license from Stanford University to develop products related to the findings.

“Blastocyst formation is a critical time point in human embryo development and provides more objective criteria for selecting which embryo(s) to transfer,” Lissa Goldenstein, president and CEO of Auxogyn, said in a statement.

“For years, researchers have searched for ways to predict the embryos most likely to reach the blastocyst stage in order to enable earlier transfer and ultimately improve live birth rates for in vitro fertilization procedures.”

The company estimates that there are 500 clinics in the United States providing in vitro fertilization or IVF services, with combined annual revenues of nearly $2 billion.",0
"Human growth hormone is a promising tool in treating cystic fibrosis, a new University of Connecticut study suggests.

Although HGH not a cure for the disease, which afflicts 30,000 people in the U.S., the researchers found that it reduced the number of hospitalizations among those who have the disease.

The study, published Monday in the journal Pediatrics, was produced by the UConn/Hartford Hospital Evidence-based Practice Center and was funded by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.

While the study offers insights on managing the disease, there's not enough evidence yet on whether HGH treatments could extend the lives of those with cystic fibrosis.

""It's intuitive that it might be beneficial as far as length of life goes, but we won't be able to go ahead and tell that just yet,"" said one of the researchers, Craig Lapin of UConn's Department of Pediatrics and the Connecticut Children's Medical Center.

Caused by defective genes, cystic fibrosis affects multiple organs. Lungs are clogged with a thick mucus, which can lead to lung infections. The disease also affects the pancreas, making it difficult for the body to absorb food, which significantly stunts growth and often leads to early deaths.

The researchers studied cases of children and adolescents with cystic fibrosis going back to the 1990s who received an injection of human growth hormone every day for six months to a year.

In the 1950s, children with cystic fibrosis generally died before age 8. But with antibiotics and other medical advances, the median age for people with the disease increased to 37 by 2008.

""As the kids with cystic fibrosis are living longer and longer, a lot of these ancillary problems are become more apparent,"" said C. Michael White, director of the Evidence-based Practice Center and lead author of the study.

In the cases studied, the researchers found that human growth hormone added 1.25 inches in height and three pounds to the patients. That growth also resulted in larger internal organs, particularly the lungs, making breathing easier.

HGH also appears to improve the mineral content in bones, making them stronger. There's not enough evidence that it prevents osteoporosis, a common result of cystic fibrosis, but White said the results are ""promising.""

For those who received human growth hormone, White said, annual hospitalizations decreased by half, from about three per year to 1.5.

HGH therapy can be expensive, but fewer hospitalizations should balance out the expense.

""Hopefully, this is going to encourage cystic fibrosis care providers to use it more frequently in patients at the lower end of weight and of short stature,"" Lapin said of the findings.

A daily injection can be difficult for a child who is already taking several other medications, White said, but going to the hospital fewer times might make up for it.

""I could see that, for a lot of kids, the injections would become just part of the daily routine,"" he said. ""They would probably be a lot less scary than hospitalizations.""",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Taking multivitamins may help women without cardiovascular disease to ward off a heart attack, new research shows.

But vitamin pills seemed to have less of an effect in women with heart disease, Dr. Susanne Rautiainen of the Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm, Sweden, and her colleagues found.

The results don’t settle the question of whether it’s actually the vitamin pills that are protective, Rautiainen told Reuters Health via e-mail.

“It is very important to keep in mind that multivitamin users tend be ‘healthier’ in general. They usually smoke less, are more physically active and have a healthier diet,” the researcher wrote. “Even if we have controlled for many of those factors that are associated with a healthy behavior we cannot exclude the possibility that we might measure a healthy lifestyle via multivitamin use.”

Approximately half of American adults report taking a multivitamin regularly.

In industrialized countries, Rautiainen and her team note in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, multivitamin use is widespread. While conventional wisdom holds that taking vitamins could help prevent heart disease, the researchers add, there’s actually little evidence to back up this claim.

To investigate the relationship between vitamin use and heart disease in women, Rautiainen and her team followed 31,671 women with no history of heart disease and 2,262 women who did have cardiovascular disease for about 10 years. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 at the study’s outset, and about 60 percent in each group used some type of dietary supplement.

During the observed period, 932 heart attacks occurred among the women without heart disease, while 269 women with existing heart disease had heart attacks.

Among the women who initially had no heart disease and did not take any dietary supplements, 3.4 percent had heart attacks, compared to 2.6 percent of the women who took multivitamins plus other supplements; this translated to a 27 percent lower heart attack risk with vitamins. Among the women with heart disease, 13 percent of the non-supplement-users had heart attacks, compared to 14 percent of women who took multivitamins only, which wasn’t a statistically significant difference (meaning it could have been due to chance).

For the women without heart disease at the study’s outset, taking a multivitamin for less than five years reduced heart attack risk by 18 percent compared with non-users of supplements. Taking vitamins for 10 or more years cut risk by 41 percent.

Similar studies have been done in men, with some confirming the current findings and others contradicting them, Rautiainen said. She concluded: “The question of whether multivitamins are good for you still remains!”

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 29, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Another study evaluating the value of mammograms for younger women finds that screening can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer for women in their 40s.

The study, done in Sweden, found that women who were screened cut their risk by 29 percent. That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md.

The findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s.

Last year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years.

That recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s.

To further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently.

The value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question.

Speaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee, said: ""This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best.""

""Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,"" Obel added. ""The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients. It remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population.""

The authors of the new research, the largest epidemiological study of its kind, looked at screening and mortality data for women in Sweden. Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties.

The study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years.

The reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered.

The benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said.

Jonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years.

In another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments.

""There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,"" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson.

Although the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.

"Sept. 28, 2010 -- An experimental rheumatoid arthritis treatment helps two-thirds of patients getting too little relief from methotrexate. The drug, from a company called Rigel, is R788 or fostamatinib disodium. The oral drug targets an enzyme called Syk. Nobody is exactly sure of the role Syk plays in rheumatoid arthritis. But there's an overabundance of Syk in the fluid of arthritic joints, and the enzyme is part of the runaway immune machinery that increases joint inflammation.

Experimental Drug Fights RA In a pilot study, the drug appeared to reduce symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis. Now Harvard researcher Michael E. Weinblatt, MD, reports results from a phase II clinical trial in which 457 patients with active rheumatoid arthritis despite methotrexate treatment received R788 or placebo for six months. For patients treated with the more active twice-daily dose of 100 milligrams of R788: 67% had at least 20% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 35% of patients getting a placebo.

43% had at least 50% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 19% getting a placebo.

28% had at least 70% fewer arthritis symptoms, compared to 10% getting a placebo.

R788 Side Effects The drug does have side effects. Among patients getting the twice-daily 100 milligram dose: 19% had diarrhea, compared to 3% getting a placebo.

14% had upper respiratory infections, compared to 7% getting a placebo.

6% had low white blood cell counts, compared to 1% getting a placebo.

23% had to start or increase blood pressure medication, compared to 7% getting a placebo. There's at least one theoretical concern about R788. Normally, the Syk enzyme helps suppress tumors. Women with breast tumors have low levels of Syk. It's not clear whether long-term use of R788 will increase cancer risk; longer-term clinical trials will have to evaluate this risk. For now, R788 looks very promising, the researchers report. ""Inhibition of the Syk pathway offers a new drug target for rheumatoid arthritis,"" Weinblatt and colleagues conclude. The Weinblatt study and an editorial by NIH researchers Juan Rivera, PhD, and Robert A. Colbert, MD, PhD, appear in the Sept. 30 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Rigel funded the study, and three of the study's six authors are Rigel employees.

"A three-year-old Silicon Valley start-up, Counsyl Inc., won the Bronze Innovation Award for its simple, low-cost genetic test that can alert prospective parents who might be carrying genes that could cause hereditary diseases in their children.

Counsyl's technology promises a ""high quality-of-life impact for families at risk for conceiving children with familial diseases,"" says Larry Bock, an Innovation Awards judge and special limited partner at venture firm Lux Capital. ""This technology bundles previously existing capabilities but with more elegance, access and affordability.""

Proponents of universal prepregnancy genetic screening make a bold claim: If these tests were widely available, they could significantly reduce, and possibly eliminate, hereditary diseases. Parents who discovered that they carried the genes that would put their children at risk for these diseases could pursue other alternatives—adoption or in vitro fertilization, for example. Widespread screening also could reduce infant mortality; 20% to 30% of infant deaths are caused by genetic illnesses.

Counsyl's test requires only a saliva sample and costs about $350. Counsyl Inc.

Until recently, however, most genetic tests covered only one disease at a time, required a blood sample and cost between $500 and $1,000 each. So both their use and their usefulness were extremely limited. Most prepregnancy genetic testing was performed for one of only a few diseases and only for certain ethnic groups, such as the screening for Tay-Sachs disease offered since the early 1980s to Jewish parents.

Counsyl, based in Redwood City, Calif., has devised a single test that covers more than 100 genetic disorders, including Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. The saliva-based test costs about $350, and the cost typically is covered by most private insurance.

The company uses a customized microarray—essentially a lab on a chip that can simultaneously test for lots of genetic variations at a time—and sophisticated statistical software to hunt for the presence of disease-causing mutations in genes. For the disorders it covers, the test is at least as accurate as common single-disease tests, the company says.

Counsyl's lab received regulatory approval in the U.S. in the spring of 2009. The test was introduced in some clinics in May of last year and became nationally available last October.

"A No-Cringe Fix? Filling Cavities Without The Drill

toggle caption Gretchen Cuda for NPR

It's just past 8 a.m., and Kimberly Baker is reclining in the dental chair at Case Western Reserve University's School of Dental Medicine in Cleveland.

Baker has three cavities. This morning, she'll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he's testing that involves no drilling -- ""which is nice because many patients don't like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,"" Phark says.

That cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain.

The treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel.

To Drill Or Not To Drill

Phark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options.

""In many of those cases we decide, 'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,"" Phark says.

German researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment's developers.

""We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,"" Paris says.

How It Works

When tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity.

The new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin.

toggle caption Gretchen Cuda for NPR

Paris says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge.

""When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,"" Paris says. ""But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube.""

Cheaper, Lighter Alternatives To The Drill

Avoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste.

""An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,"" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay.

Wolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success.

""Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works. It's just still in its earliest stages,"" Wolff says.

Because it's so new, it's still unclear how the Icon resin filling holds up over time. And clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to 15 percent of the time.

But Wolff says that for patients who aren't able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits, or who are predisposed to tooth decay, this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist's drill at bay.",1
"(CNN) -- A new study released Thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over 50 as previously thought.

The study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, analyzed data from more than 40,000 women with breast cancer.

It concluded the availability of mammography screening corresponded with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, ""but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction.""

The study involved women in Norway between ages 50 and 69.

Researchers from Norway and Harvard University compared the death rates from breast cancer in four groups: one group of women from 1996 through 2005 who were living in Norwegian counties with screening; another group in the same time period who were living in counties without screening; and two similar groups from 1986 through 1995.

""Among women in the nonscreening group, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer, as compared with the preceding 10-year period, presumably as a result of increased breast-cancer awareness, improved therapy, and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools,"" the findings state. ""Among women in the screening group, there was a 28 percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer during the same period. Thus, the relative reduction in mortality that was causally related to the screening program alone was 10 percent.""

The publication notes that in 2002, the World Health Organization concluded that mammography screening for women between ages 50 and 69 reduced the death rate from breast cancer by 25 percent.

Researchers said challenges in measuring the effectiveness of mammography screenings include increases in breast-cancer awareness and advances in treatment.",1

HealthDay Reporter

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 22, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Routine mammograms account for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates, according to a large new analysis of data from Norway's expansive breast cancer screening program.

The other two-thirds of the reduction is probably due to such factors as increased cancer awareness, improved therapy and use of more sensitive diagnostic tools, the study authors suggest.

The analysis, published in the Sept. 23 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, raises new questions about the benefits versus risks of screening mammography and is already reigniting tensions over its frequency of use in the United States.

""Women should be informed that the benefit is smaller than expected, and there should be a balanced discussion on the benefit and the possible harms of screening, such as overdiagnosis, false-negative and -positive tests and psychological distress,"" said the study's lead author, Dr. Mette Kalager, an epidemiologist with the Cancer Registry of Norway in Oslo and a visiting scientist at the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston.

""This study will only add to the confusion for women and their physicians,"" said Dr. Daniel B. Kopans, director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital and a radiology professor at Harvard Medical School.

Last November, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force spurred dissension among breast cancer experts with controversial new guidelines for breast cancer screening. The task force recommended that women begin having screening mammograms at age 50 -- not 40 -- and that those exams occur every other year, instead of annually.

But some cancer organizations reject the panel's advice. The American Cancer Society still recommends annual mammograms starting at age 40, as long as a woman is still in good health.

On Tuesday, the American College of Radiology (ACR), the Society of Breast Imaging and the American Society of Breast Disease launched ""Mammography Saves Lives,"" a campaign designed to encourage women to have an annual mammogram starting at age 40.

""Mammography is not perfect; no one has claimed that it is,"" said Kopans, a member of the ACR Commission on Breast Imaging. But since the advent of routine mammograms in the 1990s, the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped 30 percent, he observed.

""That's a huge achievement,"" Kopans noted, adding that ""it may not be a big deal to an epidemiologist who's looking at huge numbers and doesn't take care of women with breast problems.""

Norway's breast cancer screening program began in 1996 and was expanded two years later, with staggered enrollment by county over a period of nine years. Since 2005, all Norwegian women aged 50 to 69 have been invited to have a screening mammogram every two years, the authors said.

For the study, more than 40,000 Norwegian women were followed for an average of 2.2 years. Researchers compared death rates from breast cancer among four groups of women: two that were living in counties with or without screening and two groups that lived in the same counties before screening was offered.

The difference in the rate of death from breast cancer among women in the screening group versus the control group was 28 percent. In comparison, there was an 18 percent reduction in the rate of death in the non-screened group versus the control group, the study found.

In other words, breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death -- but only accounted for 10 percentage points of the difference.

""Our observed 10 percent reduction in death from breast cancer is much lower than previously thought,"" Kalager said. ""It is plausible that today, the effect of increased breast awareness and improved therapy have outweighed the effect of screening on reducing mortality from breast cancer.""

Both Kopans and Dr. Otis W. Brawley, the American Cancer Society's chief medical officer, criticized the research team's short follow-up period -- just 2.2 years of observation, on average. They both said that the time frame was insufficient to assess the effect of screening.

In an accompanying editorial, Dr. H. Gilbert Welch, a professor of medicine and community and family medicine at the Dartmouth Institute for Health Policy and Clinical Practice in Lebanon, N.H., said the Norwegian study helps to confirm that the decision to undergo screening mammography is ""a close call.""

Welch, author of a book, Should I Be Tested for Cancer? Maybe Not and Here's Why, suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities, screening mammography may be less important now than in the past.

""That physicians are still debating the relative merits of screening mammography despite the wealth of data suggests that the test is surely a close call, a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm,"" Welch wrote.

But Kopans noted that mammography is still the only test that has been proven to reduce the death rate from breast cancer and that this study should not divert attention away from that fact.

""It's clearly muddying the waters,"" he said.

"Sept. 17, 2010 -- The FDA has approved Krystexxa (pegloticase) for the treatment of gout.

Krystexxa is for adults with long-standing chronic gout who do not improve with or cannot tolerate other treatments. The drug is associated with some serious side effects.

Gout occurs when uric acid builds up in the body and forms crystals in the joints or in soft tissue. The crystals cause swelling, redness, pain, and stiffness in the joints. The condition is associated with obesity, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and diabetes. Gout is more common among men and postmenopausal women, and people with kidney disease.

Krystexxa, which is made by Savient Pharmaceuticals Inc. of East Brunswick, N.J., is an enzyme that lowers uric acid levels by metabolizing it into a chemical that does not cause bodily damage and is then passed through the urine.

The drug is administered to patients every two weeks as an intravenous infusion.

Two six-month clinical trials of 212 total patients showed that the drug lowered uric acid levels and reduced deposits of uric acid crystals in joints and soft tissue. Savient expects Krystexxa to be available by prescription later this year.",1
"Fat cells, watch out.

Two new devices—one that deflates fat cells, one that destroys them—have just been cleared for ""body contouring"" in doctors' offices by the Food and Drug Administration.

Zeltiq grabs onto love handles and belly pouches and freezes the fat cells inside, causing them to self-destruct over several months. Zerona is a low-level laser that rotates around the waist, hips and thighs, forcing the fat cells to empty in a matter of weeks. In both cases, there are no incisions, no downtime and no need for anesthesia. The fat is reabsorbed by the body.

Several other devices that claim to painlessly blast away fat with ultrasound, radio waves or lasers are already on the market or hoping for FDA approval soon. These high-tech weapons in the battle of the bulge are less invasive than liposuction—which involves loosening fat internally and vacuuming it out with a tube, a procedure that nearly 200,000 Americans had last year.

Of course, there is still no magic wand for the 66% of us who are overweight or obese: Eliminating fat cells without also eating less or exercising more may make fat crop up elsewhere and ultimately do more harm than good.

That's because fat cells are not just passive storage depots for surplus calories. They are busy chemical factories that send signals all over the body, helping to regulate growth, puberty, healing, disease-fighting and aging. Among the 100 or more hormones that fat cells secrete are adiponectine, which helps manage metabolism, and leptin, which tells the brain to eat more or less (although the brain doesn't always listen).

Much about fat cells remains mysterious. They're among the largest and longest-living cells in the body, capable of expanding at least 64 times their original size (the upper limit is unknown). A lean adult has about 40 billion fat cells; an obese adult can have 120 billion.

Zerona laser Erchonia Medical Journal Community

In general, it's healthier to have a larger number of small fat cells than fewer, fatter ones. Subcutaneous fat cells, under the skin in places like the hips, thighs and lower belly, may be unsightly, but they are relatively benign.

Their principal work is to pull excess fat out of the bloodstream, package it and store it in big droplets—one per fat cell—until the body needs it for energy.

Healthy fat cells are precisely attuned to the body's needs, says Michael D. Jensen, an endocrinologist at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn. ""When you eat too much, the fat cells store it up, and when you miss a meal, they give it back to you.""

But if fat cells aren't working properly, they don't store and release fat effectively. Harmful versions called visceral fat cells accumulate in and around organs like the heart and liver, and release fat into the bloodstream, raising the risk for heart disease, diabetes, stroke and Alzheimer's disease.

Why some fat cells stop working, and why some proliferate while others just balloon isn't understood.

Zeltiq CoolSculpting Zeltiq

Heredity clearly plays a role, as does taking in more calories than the body needs. But fat-cell function doesn't necessarily correlate with weight gain. Some people are able to carry 100 extra pounds and still have functioning fat cells; others run into metabolic trouble when they gain just a few pounds, according to Dr. Jensen.

Until recently, experts thought that all the body's fat cells were created by around age 20, and that they never died, just grew and shrunk as people gained or lost weight. But scientists at Sweden's Karolinska Institute recently discovered that even in lean people, about 10% of the body's fat cells die and are replaced each year.

""The fact that the number seems to remain constant over the years indicates that something is very much regulating the number of fat cells. That's what I'm interested in right now,"" says neuroscientist Kirsty Spalding, the lead researcher.

The amount and distribution of fat also changes naturally with age. ""People tend to gain subcutaneous fat through middle age, and then it starts to diminish, first on the back of the hands, then in the lower legs and elsewhere,"" says James L. Kirkland, a professor of aging at the Mayo Clinic. It piles up as visceral fat instead—and eventually appears in muscle, liver and even bone marrow, where the fat is a substitute for new bones. ""Losing subcutaneous fat is not good, paradoxically,"" Dr. Kirkland says.

Blasting Fat

That's partly why some obesity experts are wary of the new fat-blasting techniques. The devices can't target visceral fat, only subcutaneous fat, and if patients continue to consume more calories than they burn, they may hasten that process of accumulating harmful fat instead.

Some experts also worry that forcing fat out of fat cells can increase the level in the bloodstream.

""Fat is very toxic,"" says Dr. Jensen. ""It's not something you want in large amounts floating around free. You want it inside a cell, protected.""

Another danger is that losing fat cells could will lower leptin levels, signaling to the brain to eat more.

""That's one of the reasons it's so, so hard to maintain weight loss—the body is trying to defend a weight it got used to,"" says Mitchell Lazar, director of the Institute for Diabetes, Obesity and Metabolism at the University of Pennsylvania.

Officials at Zeltiq, of Pleasanton, Calif., and Erchonia Corp., the McKinney, Texas, company that makes Zerona, say they had to demonstrate to the FDA that triglyceride levels in the body did not rise significantly after their procedures.

""It's the equivalent of eating three to five french fries per day,"" says Mitchell Levinson, Zeltiq's founder and chief scientific officer.

They also say the process is gradual and involves a small percentage of the body's overall fat.

Still, both companies stress that it's important for patients to change their eating and exercise lifestyle habits as well.

""This is for patients who have a discreet bulge they want to get rid of,"" says Mr. Levinson. ""Your love handle will get smaller, but you won't lose any weight unless your change your behavior.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - It may be possible to predict which women will develop a dangerous complication of pregnancy called pre-eclampsia weeks before they ever show the first symptoms, an international team of researchers reported Monday.

They found a series of 45 different compounds linked with metabolism that were different in the women destined to develop the condition, and said that could form the basis of a test.

Such a “metabolic fingerprint” test could save the lives of thousands of women, Philip Baker of the University of Alberta in Canada, who helped lead the study, said in a statement.

“If we can bring the rates of maternal deaths in undeveloped countries down to the rates in developed countries, by being able to determine which women are at the greatest risk for developing pre-eclampsia, then it has that potential to save thousands of lives,” Baker said.

There is currently no test to predict which women will develop pre-eclampsia, which is marked by high blood pressure and high protein levels in urine.

If mothers and their babies survive, the women later have a higher risk of high blood pressure, heart disease, stroke and diabetes. The babies are usually born prematurely and suffer complications all their lives.

The cost of treating mothers with pre-eclampsia is $45 billion a year in the United States, Europe, Asia, Australia and New Zealand, the researchers said.

In undeveloped countries, 75,000 women die from pre-eclampsia each year.

Writing in the journal Hypertension, the researchers said they did a simple study, testing the blood of 60 women who developed pre-eclampsia later in pregnancy and 60 women who did not. They ran the test at about 15 weeks gestation.

“We identified 40 organic molecules to be significantly elevated and 5 that were reduced in plasma at 14 to 16 weeks’ gestation,” they wrote.

From this series of compounds they narrowed down a list of 14 sugars, fats and amino acids that were different in the women who developed the condition.

It detected around 90 percent of the cases, with a false positive rate of about 24 percent, meaning 24 percent of the women flagged in the test as having a risk of pre-eclampsia would never actually develop it.

“A high caliber predictive test would allow women who are identified at high-risk for pre-eclampsia to seek obstetric care by specialists and to be monitored more vigilantly,” Eleni Tsigas, executive director of the Pre-eclampsia Foundation, said in a statement.

“It would also ensure that those women are educated about the warning signs of pre-eclampsia. There’s no reason why women should be caught unaware in the late stages of a pre-eclampsia

crisis.”",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - Men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prostate cancer may benefit from regular screening for the disease, a study by British scientists found Friday.

The findings suggest that by narrowing the focus of prostate cancer screening to those whose genes put them at most risk, doctors would catch more cancers early as well as reducing the potential for costly and damaging overdiagnosis.

“Although these are early results, it appears that (prostate cancer) screening is reasonably accurate at predicting potentially aggressive prostate cancer among men at higher risk of the disease due to a genetic predisposition,” said Ros Eeles, who led a research team from Britain’s Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) and Royal Marsden hospital.

The study found that the predictive value of screening these men — expressed as the number of cancers detected relative to the number of tissue samples taken — was 48 percent, far higher than the 24 percent achieved in population-wide screening.

Screening for prostate cancer is controversial because the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) tests used cannot differentiate between men with aggressive cancer and men who would never have symptoms or need treatment, and this can lead to overdiagnosis.

A study in the United States last year found that routine prostate cancer screening had resulted in more than a million being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them.

The ICR-led study is aiming to find out whether screening men who have genetic variants that increase their prostate cancer risk could lead to earlier diagnosis. It aims to screen 1,700 men for five years, but results from the first 300 men were published in the British Journal of Urology International.

Genetic factors that increase prostate cancer risk include inheritable variations in genes known as BRCA1 and BRCA2.

Prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills 254,000 men a year. U.S. doctors routinely recommend PSA screening in men over 50 on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than doing nothing.

But fears about overdiagnosis, which can lead to treatments such as surgery, radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side-effects such as impotence and incontinence, have so far dissuaded many European countries from nationwide screening.

The men in this study — 205 with confirmed BRCA1 or BRCA2 mutations and 95 who had tested negative for the mutations — were all offered annual PSA blood testing, and 24 who had raised PSA levels were given a follow-up biopsy.

Eeles said the findings added to the increasing evidence that BRCA gene variation carriers develop more aggressive disease and supported the idea that men with genetic risks should be routinely screened for prostate cancer.",1
"""It would certainly be premature to suggest taking statins to prevent rheumatoid arthritis ,"" he tells WebMD. ""But one important message is that people who have been prescribed them should adhere to treatment. Right now about 75% of people who begin taking statins stop within two years.""

Study researcher Gabriel Chodick, MD, called the risk reduction ""important and meaningful,"" but he says more research is needed to confirm the association.

The regular use of statins was associated with a 42% reduction in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) risk in a newly reported study of patients enrolled in one of Israel's largest health plans .

Sept. 8, 2010 -- People who take cholesterol -lowering statin drugs to reduce heart disease risk may also be cutting their risk for developing the painful inflammatory joint disease rheumatoid arthritis .

Statins and Rheumatoid Arthritis

The most widely prescribed class of drugs in the world, statins such as Crestor, Lescol, Lipitor, Pravachol, and Zocor reduce cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme in the liver associated with its production.

There is also a suggestion that statins reduce systemic inflammation and may be protective against RA and other chronic inflammatory diseases.

Several studies have suggested a role for statins in slowing the progression of disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis, but others failed to find a protective benefit for statin use.

In the newly published study, Chodick and colleagues examined data on 1.8 million members of Israel's Maccabi Healthcare Services HMO. Between 1998 and 2007, 2,578 new cases of rheumatoid arthritis were identified in this group.

The analysis revealed that patients who took statins for at least eight years during the decade-long study period were roughly 40% less likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis than people who did not take statins at all or who took them less persistently.

A more modest 15% reduction in osteoarthritis risk was seen in persistent statin users. Like rheumatoid arthritis, osteoarthritis is a chronic, degenerative joint disease. But it is not driven by inflammation, so statin use is not as likely to affect its development or progression.

The study appears in the September issue of the journal PLoS Medicine.",1

WEDNESDAY, Sept. 8, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Statins, lauded for their ability to lower cholesterol and prevent heart attacks and strokes, may also reduce the risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, Israeli researchers report.

""We found that statin users who purchased their medication persistently were less likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis over a long follow-up period,"" said lead researcher Gabriel Chodick, from Maccabi Healthcare Services in Tel Aviv.

For example, compared with patients who took statins less than 20 percent of the time, patients who took statins for 40 percent to 59 percent of the time had a 23 percent lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis, he said.

""Patients who were covered for more than 80 percent of the time, had a 40 percent lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis,"" Chodick said. ""The effect was stronger in younger patients and in patients using more effective statins.""

The report was published online Sept. 7 in PLoS Medicine.

For the study, Chodick's team collected data on 1.8 million patients who got their health care through the Maccabi Healthcare Services, an HMO in Israel.

The researchers looked for connections between statin use and the development of both rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis, a degenerative joint disease that is unlikely to be affected by statins, the researchers noted.

Over nine years of follow-up, 2,578 people developed rheumatoid arthritis and 17,878 developed osteoarthritis.

When Chodick's group looked at statin use, they found that those not taking statins had a 51 percent higher risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis over about 80 percent of the follow-up period.

After looking for other possibilities, those who took statins regularly had a 41 percent lower risk of developing rheumatoid arthritis compared with people who were not taking statins regularly.

Among those taking statins, there was only a small, short-term reduction in risk of development of osteoarthritis.

""Although the study does not have immediate clinical implications, our findings may suggest that patients who were prescribed statins and take it persistently may benefit from the many effects of statins, which go far beyond cholesterol reduction, including the reduction of rheumatoid arthritis risk,"" Chodick said.

A previous study on the same group indicated that persistent use of statins was associated with substantially lower all-cause mortality, which could not be explained only by the prevention of cardiovascular disease, he said.

""We believe that a major part of the improved survival among statin users comes from the anti-inflammatory effects demonstrated by lower risk of rheumatoid arthritis. Unfortunately, our previous study indicated that, despite their benefits, many patients on statins discontinue their treatment,"" Chodick said.

This work received no outside or corporate finding, the researchers noted.

Dr. Robert Myerburg, a professor of medicine and physiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, stressed that ""this is a study looking for an association, and it doesn't prove that starting statins early in life will prevent or delay the onset of rheumatoid arthritis.""

The only way to prove the connection is with a clinical trial, Myerburg said. ""At this point, I would not use a statin for that [prevention of rheumatoid arthritis] indication,"" he said.

The basics: Almost everybody would love to have a ""healthy"" bronze glow, but almost everybody now also understands that the sun isn't our friend and that our skin needs to be protected from its stealthy attacks. But how?

We've long assumed sunscreens will do the trick, but then came reports that the vitamin-A compound (retinyl palmitate) integral to many of them could actually be making us more melanoma-prone.

As an alternative, there's a relatively new product called Fernblock, which claims to protect the skin internally by systemically inhibiting the absorption of ultraviolet rays. A natural fern extract used by indigenous people ""for centuries,"" its promotional materials say, it's taken orally. A sunscreen pill? Well, why not?

A cautionary note:The damning evidence against vitamin A, which has long been used as a skin-cancer treatment, came from experiments done on mice, which have a far higher susceptibility to skin cancers than humans. And though dermatologists who have experience with Fernblock think it offers a measure of protection, even the manufacturer warns it won't suffice alone. Creams must also be applied.

For expert advice:Consult a dermatologist. Most are still of the opinion that sunscreens with an SPF of up to 50, and containing avobenzone and oxybenzone, efficiently protect the skin from both UVA and UVB ultraviolet rays.

Our two cents' worth:There's no reason not to take a flyer on Fernblock — actress Reese Witherspoon gives it a hearty endorsement - but keep slathering up, too.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The hallucinogen psilocybin — known by the street name magic mushrooms — may help ease the anxiety that often accompanies late-stage cancer, U.S. researchers said on Monday.

Boxes containing magic mushrooms are displayed at a coffee and smart shop in Rotterdam November 28, 2008. REUTERS/Jerry Lampen

Cancer patients given a moderate dose of psilocybin — a hallucinogen with effects similar to LSD — were measurably less depressed six months after a single dose compared with a placebo. Patients seemed somewhat less anxious, they reported in the Archives of General Psychiatry.

The pilot study of 12 cancer patients was designed to prove that hallucinogenic drugs could be studied safely as a way to relieve the distress of advanced cancer.

It revives a promising field of study lasting from the 1950s to the early 1970s that suggested some patients experienced powerful and sustained improvement in mood and anxiety from hallucinogens.

Researchers said the studies were abandoned in the early 1970s when hallucinogenic drugs such as LSD — lysergic acid diethylamide — became widely used on the streets, leading to strict federal laws regulating their use.

“Forty to 45 years ago, the culture was going through tremendous upheaval. These compounds were associated with a very politically active counterculture,” said Dr. Charles Grob of Harbor-University of California Los Angeles Medical Center and the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute.

“It was something of a public health crisis. Everything had to be shut down,” Grob said in a telephone interview.

Federal law prohibits the use of the magic mushroom compound for any purpose. If it proves effective among late-stage cancer patients, U.S. regulators would need to make special accommodation for its use, Grob said.

‘TIMES HAVE CHANGED’

Grob’s study looked to see whether psilocybin could help ease some of the anxiety of dying cancer patients.

During the treatment phase of the study, patients were given a moderate dose of psilocybin and watched closely for six hours. They were told to lie still with their eyes closed as they wore headphones and listened to soothing music.

During the placebo phase, each of the 12 patients received a dose of niacin — a vitamin that raises levels of good cholesterol — and given the same instructions.

The treatments were given in random order and neither the doctors nor the patients were told which compound was administered.

All the volunteers tolerated the treatment sessions well, with no signs of severe anxiety or a “bad trip.” Most patients showed a trend of improvement in their symptoms of anxiety and at six months, and there was a statistically significant improvement on one depression scale.

Grob said the pilot study proved the drug could be studied safely in cancer patients. He said two other academic research institutions in the United States — Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore and New York University — were doing similar studies using a slightly higher dose.

“Times have changed and it’s now possible to pick up this research model again,” he said.

As many as 14 U.S. states and the District of Columbia allow the use of marijuana for medical purposes, and California voters in November will vote on whether to legalize pot.

“I think that is an indication that there has been a very strong shift within society to move away from the old cultural bias and politics of the process many years ago. I think there is a greater capacity to be open-minded and let science dictate our conclusion, not politics,” Grob said.",1

THURSDAY, Sept. 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental test that can diagnose tuberculosis in less than two hours, making only one doctor visit necessary before treatment starts, is being hailed as a potentially significant advance against a disease that kills nearly 2 million people annually, most of them in developing countries.

""This is a very important discovery,"" said infectious disease expert Dr. Marc Siegel, an associate professor of medicine at New York University. ""This could be an important tool worldwide, and even here in the United States.""

The test, known as the ""Xpert MTB/RIF"" test for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and resistance to rifampin (RIF), appears to be more than 97 percent accurate and is even able to diagnose drug-resistant TB, researchers said.

A report on the researchers' work was published in the Sept. 2 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Further trials of the new test are planned, the researchers said.

Current testing for tuberculosis (TB) involves looking at sputum (respiratory mucus) under a microscope. But Siegel said such testing, which has been in use for more than a century, isn't always accurate. It also can take weeks for results from a TB culture, and infections can be missed.

""That [the existing test] is knives and bearskins compared to this"" new test, Siegel said. The one potential drawback to the new test would be the expense, he said, adding, ""The key question is what's it going to cost?""

For the study, a research team led by Dr. Catharina C. Boehme, of the Foundation for Innovative New Diagnostics in Geneva, Switzerland, used the Xpert MTB/RIF test on 1,730 patients suspected of having drug-sensitive or multidrug-resistant pulmonary tuberculosis. The patients were from Azerbaijan, India, Peru and South Africa.

The test diagnosed tuberculosis in 99.2 percent of the patients, the researchers found. It also detected TB in 72.5 percent of people with the disease who had not been diagnosed with the conventional microscopic exam.

""The test that we developed finally makes it possible to detect TB in a single clinic visit,"" Dr. David Alland, chief of infectious diseases at the UMDNJ-New Jersey Medical School, said in a university news release.

""The test also indicates rapidly whether difficult-to-treat, drug-resistant forms are present,"" he said.

The test was created by the California-based corporation Cepheid, which plans to seek U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval for the test, which went on sale late last year in Europe.

The test costs about $63 in Europe, but the company has agreed to provide it for less than half that in poor countries, said John Bishop, Cepheid's chief executive officer, as quoted in a story by the Associated Press. The machine costs around $30,000, but would be priced under $20,000 in poor countries, he told the AP.

Tuberculosis is a chronic bacterial infection that's spread through the air and usually infects the lungs, although other organs of the body can be involved. Most people who are infected with tuberculosis bacterium (Mycobacterium tuberculosis) don't have symptoms, but some will develop the disease, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health.

Some 2 billion people -- one-third of the world's population -- are thought to be infected with tuberculosis bacteria. Though largely eliminated in developed countries, TB remains a leading killer of young adults worldwide. The World Health Organization estimates that 8 million people develop active TB each year and nearly 2 million die.

"A popular dietary supplement called SAMe may help depressed patients who don’t respond to prescription antidepressant treatment, a new study shows.

SAMe stands for S-adenosyl methionine, a naturally occurring molecule that is widely used in Europe for depression, arthritis and other ailments. It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain.

The latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments.

“There are many directions in research that this opens up,” said Dr. George I. Papakostas, director of treatment resistant depression studies at Mass General and the study’s lead author. “It provides clues to new treatments, and it provides clues to understanding what causes depression as well as what goes on biochemically when people get better from depression.”

The researchers studied the use of SAMe or a placebo in 73 adults with depression who were not responding to prescription antidepressant treatment. All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment.

After six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry.

The research offers hope to patients who haven’t been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. Studies suggest that for more than half of depressed patients, antidepressants alone don’t eliminate symptoms. As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as “nonresponders.”

Modern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It’s not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters.

“Most antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,” said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. “It may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That’s probably the best hypothesis.”

Other studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs.

In his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes.

Dr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study “needs replication” but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research.

“It’s a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,” Dr. Papakostas said. “In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism. It’s a medication that works differently than everything else.”

The study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health, but the SAMe pills and placebo pills were provided by the dietary supplement maker Pharmavite. Dr. Papkostas, Dr. Nelson and other researchers involved in the study all disclosed several financial relationships with makers of prescription antidepressants.",1
"Breast Removal Reduces Cancer Risk In Some Women

Enlarge this image toggle caption Damian Dovarganes/AP Damian Dovarganes/AP

A new study in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows the clearest evidence yet that women carrying the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes should consider preventive surgery because they are at a very high risk for breast and ovarian cancers.

It confirms what smaller studies have suggested in the past: Women who have a family history of breast cancer can greatly reduce their chances of getting the disease by having a double mastectomy.

And, if they also have their ovaries removed, they can further reduce the risk of breast cancer and minimize their chances of getting ovarian cancer.

Researchers from around the country tracked nearly 2,500 women with the BRCA mutations who had surgery to try to prevent breast and ovarian cancer.

""We found mastectomy provided huge risk reduction of subsequent breast cancer diagnosis and death. Risk reduction [was] probably in the range of 80 to 95 percent,"" said researcher Timothy Rebbeck, an epidemiologist at the University of Pennsylvania.

And women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as 80 percent.

The study findings are extremely reassuring to Rebbeck -- no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow-up. Among the women who did not have the surgery, 7 percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer.

Rebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero. That's because all the tissue is never completely taken out.

""Breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can't be completely removed through surgical means. And, with ovarian cancer, the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous. So, it's just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk,"" he says.

Toby's Story

One of the women who decided to take that chance is 61-year-old Toby of New Jersey. (Because she's worried about her health coverage, she doesn't want her last name used.)

Toby's mother died of ovarian cancer when Toby was in her 20s. Researchers now know that disease is linked, along with breast cancer, to genetic mutations.

Toby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the BRCA genes about five years ago.

But at first, she had hoped to avoid the surgery.

""After my genetic testing, they would alternate mammogram with MRI every six months. I thought I was getting very, very good surveillance, and I thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very, very early and be able to cure me if I were to get breast cancer,"" she says.

But her doctors thought otherwise. Breast cancer caused by BRCA mutations is particularly aggressive. And they told Toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as 90 percent.

Toby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery.

Women like Toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery. Only 3 percent of those who had surgery died, compared with 10 percent of those who did not, during the follow-up period.

Role Of Genetic Testing

In an editorial accompanying the study, Virginia Kaklamani, an oncologist at Northwestern University, says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing.

""A lot of times I see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer. Preventable because I can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer,"" she says.

""Had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them, they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy. So, we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn't,"" says Kaklamani.

For Toby, it's been about a year since her double mastectomy. She's had reconstruction. And, today, she says she feels physically strong again. But she now feels an emotional empowerment, and that comforts her.

""My mother left me when I was 26, and it was extremely painful and traumatic for my entire life,"" she says. ""I just didn't want to do that for my children. I had a chance to control that and to fight what my mother never had a chance for.""

Oncologist Kaklamani says women with the BRCA mutation should be counseled about genetic testing, and strongly consider it.

While surgical decisions are up to patients, the findings of this study should help them decide what to do, she says.

TUESDAY, Aug. 31, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Women who carry genetic mutations that boost their odds of breast and ovarian cancer can live longer and reduce their cancer risk by having preventive surgery, a new study suggests.

The surgery in question is drastic: removal of the breasts or ovaries before any signs of cancer have arisen.

However, ""what our findings show is that women who choose to have these surgeries will reduce their risk of dying of breast or ovarian cancer by about 70 to 80 percent, which is pretty profound,"" said study senior author Dr. Timothy Rebbeck, a professor of epidemiology at the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine.

The findings are published in the Sept. 1 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association.

The 22-center trial, one of the largest of its kind, studied nearly 2,500 women who were found to have inherited mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes.

Women who carry these mutations have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of anywhere between 56 percent to 84 percent, according to the researchers, whereas the risk for ovarian cancer ranges from 36 percent to 63 percent for BRCA1 mutation carriers and 10 percent to 27 percent for BRCA2 mutation carriers. By contrast, the lifetime risk of breast cancer among women generally is about 12 percent, and for ovarian cancer, it's less than 2 percent.

Roughly half of the women in the study had undergone either mastectomies (surgery to remove their breasts) or salpingo-oophorectomies (surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes) between 1974 and 2008, in order to proactively lower their risk of cancer. The women were followed for an average of about 3.5 years.

During the follow-up period, no breast cancer events occurred in the women who underwent mastectomies, while 7 percent of the women in the group who didn't undergo surgery were diagnosed with breast cancer.

In addition, women who had their ovaries removed lowered their risk of ovarian and breast cancer, and also lived longer than women who didn't have the surgery. For example, over 6 years of follow-up, no ovarian cancer cases were seen among BRCA2 mutation carriers who underwent salpingo-oophorectomy, compared with 3 percent of carriers who did not undergo the procedure, the researchers report.

""One of the main messages of our study is that salpingo-oophorectomy should be part of any management plan for any woman who is found to have these genetic mutations,"" said Rebbeck. ""There really isn't anything else that can reduce a woman's risk by this much.""

""These findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing,"" said Dr. Virginia Kaklamani, co-author of an editorial that accompanied the study. ""I see women all the time who get the genetic test only after they're diagnosed with cancer,"" said Kaklamani, who is director of translational breast cancer research at the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center of Northwestern University, in Chicago.

Kaklamani added that she hoped the findings would encourage more women to ask their primary care physicians whether they are candidates for genetic counseling.

""This is a very important study because it gives us more information in order to counsel women at risk,"" said Dr. Daniel Silver, assistant professor of medicine at the Dana Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School. Silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face ""a very complex set of considerations, so the more hard facts you can give them, the better.""

According to Rebbeck, doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age 35, but are okay with putting it off until age 40 if they haven't finished having children. He said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting, with the use of laparoscopes, which limits scarring and shortens a patient's recovery time.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Women with mutations in the well-known BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes who have their breasts and ovaries removed are much more likely to survive than women who do not get preventive surgery, U.S. researchers said on Tuesday.

The study shows the benefits of genetic tests that give women with a family history of cancer the chance to take steps to increase their chances of survival, they said.

“This is the first study to prove women survive longer with these preventive surgeries and shows the importance of genetic testing when there is a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer,” Dr. Virginia Kaklamani of Northwestern University in Chicago wrote in a commentary about the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

Women with mutations in the BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes have a 56 to 84 percent higher risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes.

Those with the BRCA1 mutation also have a 36 to 63 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer and those with the BRCA2 mutation have a 10 to 27 percent higher risk of ovarian cancer.

Because of this, many women make the difficult choice to have their breasts or ovaries and fallopian tubes surgically removed to reduce their risk.

Dr. Susan M. Domchek of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues studied the effectiveness of these procedures in 2,482 women with BRCA mutations, including 247 women who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their breasts and 993 who had risk-reducing surgery to remove their ovaries.

No woman who had a mastectomy developed breast cancer during the three years of follow-up testing.

Seven percent of women who decided against a mastectomy were diagnosed with breast cancer in the same period.

“Our results confirm that risk-reducing mastectomy is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk,” Domchek and colleagues wrote.

Women with BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutations who had their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed had similar results.

About 10 to 20 percent of breast and ovarian cancers are due to BRCA1 or BRCA2 genes. “Most of these women will die of ovarian cancer, so you can save 20 percent of them with the prophylactic surgery,” Kaklamani said.

“And you can save the majority of women who would have died of their breast cancer,” she added.

She said primary care physicians, gynecologists and women “need to be more aware that these tests exist.”

Dr. Sandhya Pruthi, a breast cancer expert at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota, who counsels women with BRCA mutations, said the study adds more evidence that the surgery can help save lives, but the choice is never easy.

“It’s not cookie-cutter medicine,” Pruthi, who was not involved in the study, said in a telephone interview.

She said women need to come to terms with the psychological issues involved in having their breasts removed, and younger women who have their ovaries removed must contend with early menopause symptoms.

“It’s not a decision made on a single visit,” she said.

According to the American Cancer Society and the International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1.3 million new breast cancer cases are diagnosed around the world every year and it kills 465,000 women annually, making it the leading global cancer killer of women.",0
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The common diabetes drug metformin may hold promise as a way to keep smokers from developing lung cancer, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday.

They said metformin prevented lung tumor growth in mice exposed to a cancer-causing agent found in tobacco smoke, and because it is already widely used in people, it may be worth further study.

Metformin has been shown to switch on an enzyme that blocks mTOR — a protein that helps tobacco-induced lung tumors grow.

A team led by Dr. Philip Dennis of the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, studied metformin in mice exposed to a potent, cancer-causing agent in tobacco called nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone or NNK.

They treated the mice with metformin either orally or with an injection. Mice that got the drug orally had 40 to 50 percent fewer tumors, while those injected with the drug had 72 percent fewer tumors.

The findings were so strong the team now wants to test it in smokers to see if it can keep then from developing tumors.

“Although smoking cessation is the most important step for current smokers, over half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed in former smokers, raising the importance of identifying those at highest risk and identifying effective preventive treatments,” Dennis, whose findings were published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, said in a statement.

Other studies have shown that metformin can cut diabetics’ risk of pancreatic and breast cancers, and the latest finding now suggests it may defend the body against smoking-induced lung tumors.

“This important laboratory study, together with prior laboratory and epidemiology research, suggests that metformin may be useful in cancer prevention and treatment,” said Dr. Michael Pollak of McGill University in Montreal, who wrote a review on metformin research in the same journal.

The World Health Organization says tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death globally, killing more than 5 million people each year from heart disease, cancer and lung disease.

The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 20 percent of U.S. adults smoke. Tobacco kills one-third to one-half of those who smoke.",1
"Houston surgeons treat heart through spinal cord New pathway to the heart

Electrical stimulation of the spinal column may ease cardiac problems without drugs

In a possible new way to treat heart failure, Houston surgeons implanted a device and wire in a Pearland man Monday that will electrically stimulate portions of his spinal cord.

The method, commonly used to treat pain, activates nerves that Methodist Hospital doctors think will improve the heart's ability to pump effectively, lowering blood pressure, reducing the amount of irregular heartbeats and stopping stress hormones from overreacting and causing cardiac damage.

""Despite the development of drugs that treat heart failure, patients continue to deteriorate,"" said Dr. Guillermo Torre-Amione, a Methodist heart failure specialist and leader of the effort. ""This is a new concept that could increase therapeutic efficacy without adding new medications.""

Hollis Bardwell, 61, sounded excited about the possibility Monday evening, five hours after surgeons finished putting the pacemaker-like device in the side of his lower back and threading an attached 35-inch wire up his spine. He said he hopes the therapy will give him greater mobility while he waits for a heart transplant.

""I'm looking forward to rocking and rolling again,"" said Bardwell.

Doctors said Bardwell was doing well Monday evening and should be able to leave the hospital tonight.

Bardwell hasn't worked since November because his condition, inherited, makes breathing so difficult. He was hospitalized 14 times in 2009, always to have fluid drained from his lungs so he could breathe. He went on the heart transplant waiting list two months ago.

Monday's implantation marked the beginning of Torre's Phase 1 clinical trial of the therapy, the first time what is known as neurostimulation has been used to treat heart failure.

There is considerable data showing connections between the brain, nervous system and heart, said Torre, but until now, no one has attempted to take advantage of the relationship therapeutically.

Prognosis is grave

If the experiment proves successful, it would provide an entirely different approach to heart failure, a chronic, progressive disease that affects nearly 6 million Americans.

Characterized by the heart's inability to supply sufficient blood flow to meet the body's needs, heart failure can lead to shortness of breath, fluid and retention, lung congestion and rapid or irregular heartbeats. It is usually ultimately fatal.

The condition is currently treated by oral medications, almost all of which lower blood pressure. A typical heart failure patient is on seven such drugs, which Torre characterized as ""the limit."" Because new drugs can only be tested on top of existing therapy, introducing potentially better drugs is difficult.

Neurostimulation works by sending low-intensity electrical impulses to targeted portions of the spinal cord.

The hope is that such stimulation will modulate nervous system responses, such as toning down the release of hormones that typically occur at times of stress and increasing the flow of blood.

20-patient study

The study calls for Torre to implant the system, done through small puncture holes in the lower back, in 20 patients with advanced heart failure, then conducting tests on them after one, two and three months to measure heart function.

Torre said though patients may feel some euphoria in the early days, it likely will take about a month before doctors have a good idea whether the therapy is working.

The therapy passed a first test Monday evening as doctors adjusted the electrical impulse level to Bardwell's satisfaction.

""It's really mild,"" said Bardwell. ""The most I feel is a tingle like when your hand is going to sleep on you. When it's set low, I don't feel anything at all.""

"Aug. 30, 2010 -- Three puffs a day of cannabis, better known as marijuana, helps people with chronic nerve pain due to injury or surgery feel less pain and sleep better, a Canadian team has found.

''It's been known anecdotally,"" says researcher Mark Ware, MD, assistant professor of anesthesia and family medicine at McGill University in Montreal. ""About 10% to 15% of patients attending a chronic pain clinic use cannabis as part of their pain [control] strategy,"" he tells WebMD.

But Ware's study is more scientific -- a clinical trial in which his team compared placebo with three different doses of cannabis. The research is published in CMAJ, the Canadian Medical Association Journal.

The new study ''adds to the trickle of evidence that cannabis may help some of the patients who are struggling [with pain] at present,"" Henry McQuay, DM, an emeritus fellow at Balliol College, Oxford University, England, writes in a commentary accompanying the study.",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists in Canada and Sweden have used laboratory-made biosynthetic corneas to restore vision to patients in a small human trial, and shown for the first time that they can help to repair damaged eye tissue.

The scientists, whose work was published Wednesday in the Science Translational Medicine journal, said their findings offered hope for the millions of people who go blind each year because of a worldwide shortage of corneas for donation. “This study ... is the first to show that an artificially fabricated cornea can integrate with the human eye and stimulate regeneration,” said May Griffith of the Ottawa Hospital Research Institute, who led the study.

“With further research, this approach could help restore sight to millions of people who are waiting for a donated human cornea for transplantation.”

The cornea is a tiny piece of transparent, film-like tissue that covers the surface of our eyes. Made from parallel strands of the protein collagen, it refracts light to focus images on the retina.

Although the fragile film is easily destroyed by trauma or infection, replacement human corneas can be used to restore vision, although this depends on a steady supply of donors.

A team led by Griffith and Per Fagerholm, an ophthalmology professor and eye surgeon at Linkoping University in Sweden, conducted the study by removing diseased tissue from the corneas of 10 patients and replacing them with biosynthetic implants designed to mimic a normal human cornea.

For the process they used recombinant human collagen, a substance synthesized in the laboratory to mimic human tissue and supplied by the San Francisco biotech firm FibroGen Inc.

The patients were monitored for two years after surgery. The researchers found that, eventually, the cells and nerves from nine of the 10 patients regrew completely and packed themselves into the implant, resulting in a kind of “regenerated” cornea that looked and functioned like normal, healthy eye tissue.

The biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears, the researchers said. Vision improved in six of the 10 patients.

After the patients were also fitted with contact lenses, which is common after corneal transplants, their vision was comparable with that of patients who undergo regular human corneal tissue transplants.

“The results were pretty encouraging and there is great potential here,” Fagerholm said in a telephone interview.

Loss of vision due to corneal disease or trauma affects over 10 million people a year, but lack of access to donor tissue limits the number of transplants, particularly in poorer countries.

In the United States, an estimated 42,000 corneal grafts a year are performed using tissue from posthumous donors, but there are sometimes problems with rejection and experts say failure rates are significant.

Fagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long-term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas.",1

"Researchers said they had identified a family of retroviruses in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, opening up a potentially promising new avenue of treatment for a debilitating disease that afflicts as many as four million Americans and 17 million people world-wide.

The finding will likely spur patients with the condition to seek treatment with drugs used to fight HIV, the virus that causes AIDS. Although HIV and the newly identified virus group are different, they are both retroviruses.

The report, published Monday in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, was accompanied by a call for new clinical trials to test HIV drugs in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome.

Doctors don't know what causes chronic fatigue syndrome, characterized by debilitating fatigue and chronic pain with symptoms that can wax and wane over time. Some patients say friends, co-workers and even family members don't believe they are really sick.

Studies finding a viral connection with the disease would completely transform how the illness is treated and viewed. The findings also offer a potential path for treatment, possibly with drugs that are already FDA-approved for another condition.

Based on other recent research linking the syndrome to a retrovirus called XMRV, some doctors are already prescribing drugs approved for HIV for fatigue patients. The syndrome has no effective treatments yet.

The group of viruses identified in fatigue patients, called murine leukemia virus-related viruses, or MLV, are known to cause cancer and neurological problems in mice, but whether they cause disease in humans isn't known. XMRV is among several different members of the MLV family, researchers said.

In the new study, researchers said they found at least one of four different MLV-like viruses in 32 of 37, or 86.5%, of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome, compared with just three of 44, or 6.8%, of apparently healthy blood donors.

Monday's paper is the latest in a series of reports about a possible link between CFS and a virus. Interest in viruses has been intense since an October report in the journal Science found XMRV in a majority of fatigue patients.

Subsequent studies have focused on XMRV and found conflicting evidence. Indeed, the just-published study was held back from publication in June because it was at odds with a report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which found no evidence of XMRV in chronic-fatigue-syndrome patients.

Related Slideshow <<

The current paper didn't find XMRV, either—one reason it isn't likely to resolve a brewing debate over the role XMRV may play in the syndrome.

But researchers said the variants of MLV-like viruses closely related to XMRV that they found in fatigue patients was evidence of a link between the virus family and the syndrome.

Andrew Mason, a University of Alberta professor, co-wrote the commentary in the journal calling for trials testing anti-retrovirals in CFS patients who are positive for one of the MLV-related viruses. ""If the patients improve, after a certain point you stop debating whether it causes the disease and say, the treatment works and we're going to use it,'' said Dr. Mason.

But until scientists develop further evidence establishing that the virus causes the syndrome, a large-scale clinical trial testing HIV drugs against the ailment isn't likely. Norbert Bischofberger, chief scientific officer at Gilead Sciences Inc., GILD -1.36% the leading maker of HIV drugs, said the company might consider a small pilot trial but would like to see stronger evidence that the viruses cause CFS before launching a large trial. Still, ""I'm very open, and this would be a great opportunity,'' he said.

A spokesman for Merck MRK -0.59% & Co., another major manufacturer of HIV drugs, said: ""A clinical trial program would be possible to develop only after further substantial evidence of an association with CFS.''

Some doctors and patients are already testing the idea, based in part on a University of Utah and Emory University study in cells. The compounds were tested singly and then in combinations of two at a time, and suggested that three anti-retroviral drugs appeared to inhibit infection by XMRV.

Jamie Deckoff-Jones, 56 years old, a doctor and CFS patient in New Mexico, has been blogging about her experiences and those of her 20-year-old daughter. Both tested positive for XMRV and are taking a combination of three anti-retrovirals.

Dr. Deckoff-Jones said a year ago she could only get up for short periods during the day. After five months on the drugs, she flew last week to Reno for an XMRV conference. Her daughter was able to go to a party and is enrolling in community college. ""This is all very new, and there is no way to know if improvement will continue,'' Dr. Deckoff-Jones wrote in an email, ""but we appear to be on an uphill course.''

After the latest paper was held, the researchers took additional steps to demonstrate that the finding was related to a retrovirus and not lab contamination. Eight of the fatigue patients in the study who tested positive for an MLV-related virus using blood frozen 15 years ago were asked to come back to give fresh blood. Seven of the eight remained positive, and the virus had changed slightly over time, a characteristic of a retrovirus.

Many questions remain on why different groups are coming up with different results. It is still unclear why the Centers for Disease Control didn't find XMRV or MLV-related viruses in its own study of fatigue patients. At a press briefing Monday, Steve Monroe, director of CDC's division of high-consequence pathogens and pathology, said that CDC was able to find MLV-related viruses in a small number of prostate cancer patients, data that isn't yet published.

Anthony L. Komaroff of Harvard Medical School, an author of the latest study, said one explanation may be that the patients used in the new study were chosen because they were very sick. Patients in other studies ""are a very different group of people than the ones that knock on my door,'' he said.

Meantime, the finding that a small fraction of healthy blood donors may be harboring MLV-like virus raises new worries, researchers said. If confirmed and shown to reflect the presence of the virus in the broader population, it could mean that tens of millions of people in the U.S. and more world-wide are infected.

The implications aren't clear. Research has also linked XMRV to prostate cancer. People diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are already barred from donating blood in Canada, Australia and New Zealand out of fear a virus may be passed on through transfusions.

AABB, a Bethesda, Md., organization whose members collect most blood donated in the U.S., advises that Americans with fatigue syndrome not donate blood until more data are available. A federally led working group is trying to determine how many blood donors may be infected.

FRIDAY, Aug. 20, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Not only does virtual colonoscopy identify colorectal cancer, it also boosts the likelihood of detecting cancers outside of the colon, a new study shows.

Virtual colonoscopy is less invasive than regular colonoscopy. In addition to offering doctors a look at the inside of the colon, virtual colonoscopy examines the entire abdomen and pelvis.

The ability of virtual colonoscopy to identify significant lesions outside the colon at an early, treatable stage ""may increase the yield"" of colorectal cancer screening, thus underscoring its potential as a major screening technique, study author Dr. Ganesh R. Veerappan said in a news release from the American College of Radiology/American Roentgen Ray Society.

The study included 2,277 people who underwent a virtual colonoscopy. Findings of cancers and lesions outside the colon were identified in 1,037 of the patients, including 787 insignificant and 240 significant findings.

Regarding findings outside the colon, a virtual colonoscopy ""increased the odds of identifying high-risk lesions by 78 percent. [It] should be considered as an alternative to optical colonoscopy for colorectal cancer screening or as a onetime procedure to identify significant treatable intracolonic and extracolonic lesions,"" Veerappan said.

The study appears in the September issue of the American Journal of Roentgenology.

WEDNESDAY, Aug. 18, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Fibromyalgia sufferers may find relief from the chronic pain condition by doing tai chi, new research finds.

Researchers divided 66 people with fibromyalgia into two groups: one group did hour-long sessions of tai chi twice a week for 12 weeks; the other had a twice-weekly wellness education class followed by gentle stretching.

At the end of 12 weeks, the tai chi group reported improvements in their scores on questionnaires regarding both physical and mental fibromyalgia symptoms. That included decreased pain and increased ability to do daily tasks without pain; less fatigue, depression and anxiety; and an overall better quality of life. Patients also reported better sleep quality and improved physical conditioning.

The improvements were still evident at 24 weeks, according to the research reported in the Aug. 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

""It was incredible,"" said lead study author Dr. Chenchen Wang, an associate professor of medicine in the rheumatology department at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. ""You could see them change every week. They became very happy. I felt very, very excited to be with them.""

Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia and multiple tender points. The syndrome can also cause psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and memory and concentration problems, sometimes called the ""fibromyalgia fog.""

About 10 million Americans have fibromyalgia, and about 75 percent to 90 percent of them are women, according to estimates from the National Fibromyalgia Association.

Doctors will often suggest exercise, sleep hygiene techniques and medications to treat the condition, but often with limited success, said Dr. Gloria Yeh, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal.

Most patients, according to background information in the article, remain in pain years after the diagnosis, are aerobically unfit, have poor muscle strength and flexibility, and need medications to control symptoms.

While larger studies are needed to confirm the findings, tai chi looks promising as an alternative treatment, Yeh said.

""This could represent an ideal exercise for fibromyalgia sufferers. Since it is a low-impact, gentle, non-threatening, accessible activity, it may be a perfect exercise for debilitated patients with fibromyalgia who otherwise cannot or choose not to do other forms of exercise,"" Yeh said. ""Also, since tai chi has a meditative component, it may also help to address the stress and anxiety that may be associated with the condition.""

So what is it about tai chi that works?

There's no definitive answer to that just yet, Wang said. Tai chi is a mind-body exercise that originated as a martial art in China, utilizing slow, gentle movements to build strength and flexibility, as well as deep breathing and relaxation, to move qi, or vital energy, throughout the body.

Prior research has shown exercise can improve mood, Wang added. The controlled breathing and movements may promote ""mental tranquility,"" according to the study, which could help with pain.

""The physical component of tai chi can improve aerobic capacity, strength and muscle function,"" Wang said. ""But in my opinion, the most important part is mental. You see lots of patients improve their depression and become good friends with each other.""

The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the U.S. National Institutes of Health provided funding for the research.

TUESDAY, Aug. 17, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Less invasive biopsies done with the help of imaging to guide the needle now make up the majority of biopsies being done, a new study finds.

In fact, the use of these minimally invasive biopsies increased from 59 percent to 67 percent of all biopsies between 1997 and 2008, a trend which is likely to continue, one expert noted. A biopsy involves the removal of tissue or fluids to test for disease.

""Doing image-guided biopsy allows more definitive diagnosis and shorter hospital stays,"" said Dr. Robert Quencer, chair of radiology at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, who was not involved on the study.

In addition, image-guided biopsies are more accurate, Quencer said. ""This is a trend throughout the whole country. I doubt there is any variation to this in any major medical center.""

The report is published online and in the September print edition of Radiology.

For the study, a team led by Dr. Sharon W. Kwan, a radiology resident at the University of California, San Francisco, looked at biopsies done among Medicare patients from 1997 through 2008.

During that time, the number of biopsies increased from 1,380 per 100,000 in 1997 to 1,945 per 100,000 in 2008. That's an annual growth of 3 percent in number of biopsies, the researchers noted.

Moreover, by 2008, 67 percent of these biopsies were being done through the skin with the help of CT scans, ultrasound and MRI, Kwan's group found.

""We also found that the use of imaging guidance increased over this time period, most likely because the technique enables more efficient and safe targeting of lesions,"" Kwan said in a news release.

This increase in less-invasive biopsies went along with a decrease in the number of more-invasive biopsies and through-the-skin biopsies where no imaging was used, the researchers found.

The only two areas where needle biopsies were not the majority of biopsies done were biopsies of lymph nodes and soft tissues. For these areas, open biopsies are easier to do and need less imaging guidance, Kwan's team noted.

Quencer thinks the use of image-guided biopsies will continue to increase over time, even for lymph nodes and soft tissues. ""In time, I would expect 80 to 90 percent of biopsies will be image-guided biopsies,"" he said.

"Aug. 16, 2010 -- A probiotic supplement may be an option for parents trying to soothe a colicky baby, according to a new study.

Researchers from the University of Turin, Italy, found that a few daily drops of Lactobacillus reuteri, a bacterium that can help improve digestion, significantly reduced crying among infants with colic.

The findings were published online today in Pediatrics.

Colic occurs during the first three months of an infant's life in which an otherwise healthy child cries and cannot be comforted for three hours or more every day. Colic affects up to 28% of infants and has no known cause or cure.

However, recent research suggests colic may linked to an immature immune system struggling with bacterial imbalances in the gastrointestinal tract, and that high levels of E. coli bacteria in particular may contribute to colic symptoms. Some researchers question whether symptoms could be alleviated using probiotic therapy, or ""healthy"" bacteria to restore bacterial balance in the gut.

To test this theory, the Italian researchers compared 25 healthy infants who were randomly assigned to receive drops of Lactobacillus reuteri to 21 healthy infants randomly assigned to receive placebo drops. All the infants were diagnosed with colic, born full-term at a healthy gestational weight, had no history of gastrointestinal disorders, were breastfed, not formula fed, and did not receive any other probiotic supplements during the week prior to the study. The infants' mothers were also advised to avoid cow's milk in their own diets during the study period.",1
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Measuring certain proteins in spinal fluid can accurately diagnose Alzheimer’s and predict which patients with memory problems will develop the fatal brain-wasting disease, Belgian researchers said on Monday.

And they may also help identify early signs of the disease in healthy people, the team reported in the Archives of Neurology.

“The unexpected presence of the Alzheimer’s disease signature in more than one-third of cognitively normal subjects suggests that Alzheimer’s disease pathology is active and detectable earlier than has heretofore been envisioned,” Geert De Meyer of Ghent University in Belgium and colleagues wrote.

They said measuring traces of beta amyloid and tau — two proteins associated with the telltale plaques and tangles that form in the brains of patients with Alzheimer’s — accurately detected Alzheimer’s in 90 percent of patients with the disease.

They were also able to detect 100 percent of people with memory impairments who would progress to Alzheimer’s disease within five years. And they detected Alzheimer’s proteins in 36 percent of people with normal brain function.

The study is the latest to show that measuring disease-related proteins in spinal fluid is useful in diagnosing Alzheimer’s disease.

Currently, only an autopsy can confirm that a person has Alzheimer’s, a fatal and incurable deterioration of the brain that affects more than 26 million people globally.

Doctors diagnose Alzheimer’s by excluding other causes of memory loss, such as stroke, tumors and heavy drinking. They can also administer simple paper-and-pencil tests.

But biomarkers — proteins and imaging techniques — are helping to identify the disease much earlier.

Last month, experts at the National Institute on Aging and the Alzheimer’s Association proposed new guidelines for diagnosing Alzheimer’s even before patients have symptoms. [ID:nN13273900] These proposed rules included measurements of cerebral-spinal fluid.

In the study, De Meyer and colleagues analyzed spinal fluid from 114 adults with normal brain function, 200 who had mild cognitive impairment — a precursor to dementia — and 102 who had Alzheimer’s. They identified one protein signature that was associated with Alzheimer’s, and another that indicated healthy brain function.

When they looked to see how accurate these signatures were at spotting the disease, they found 90 percent of those with Alzheimer’s had the disease pattern in their spinal fluid. The pattern was present in 72 percent of those with mild cognitive impairment and 36 percent of those who were normal.",0
"LONDON (Reuters) - A 15-minute brain scan could in future be used to test for autism, helping doctors diagnose the complex condition more cheaply and accurately.

British scientists said on Tuesday their rapid test had proved more than 90 percent accurate in adults and there was no reason why it should not work equally well in children.

It could be a boon for patients and their doctors by reducing reliance on time-consuming and emotionally trying assessments based on interviews and behavioral observation.

Autism is a complex brain disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication, ranging from mild to profound impairment.

The new scanning method — which picks up on structural changes in the brain’s grey matter — could be ready for general use in a couple of years. The next goal is to test it in children.

“What we are working on now is to see if we find the same results in younger people,” research leader Declan Murphy, professor of psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King’s College London, said in an interview.

“We would hope that it would work just as well ... there is no reason why not.”

TREATMENT

The ability to base a diagnosis on an objective biological test, rather than having to rely on personality traits, should mean patients get treatment more quickly, he added.

Cognitive behavioral therapy and educational treatment can be highly effective for some patients and the impact of a more certain prognosis would be especially beneficial for children.

Murphy and colleagues, who published their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience, studied 20 healthy adults and another 20 individuals previously diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which also includes Asperger syndrome.

The accuracy of the scan in predicting autism was so high that the results were strongly significant, despite the small number of patients involved.

Experts not involved in the research applauded the research but cautioned further study was still needed.

“Although this method is not ready for normal diagnostic situations, any step to easier diagnosis is welcome,” said Terry Brugha, professor of psychiatry at the University of Leicester.

Murphy said he envisaged that in future autism specialists would use a scan alongside interviews, in much the same way as doctors monitoring diabetes look at blood test results alongside patient histories.

The new system works by analyzing variations in the shape and structure of brain regions linked to language and social behavior, using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines made by companies like General Electric, Siemens and Philips.

The speed of the test makes it some 20 times cheaper than traditional tests, which can take a team of doctors four to eight hours to conduct. The actual brain scan costs around 100 pounds ($157.5).

Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed in one percent of the population in Britain and the United States, and the condition affects four times as many boys as girls. Researchers agree there is a strong genetic component.",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - An “electronic nose” could be used as a simple breath test to detect lung, breast, bowel and prostate cancers, Israeli scientists said Wednesday.

Using the sensor to pinpoint chemical variations, the team found they could not only distinguish between healthy and malignant breath but also identify the four different common tumor types.

While more work is needed to develop the technology, the early success could lead to the development of a cheap, easy-to-use and portable test to help diagnose cancer earlier.

“If we can confirm these initial results in large-scale studies, this new technology could become a simple tool for early diagnosis of cancer along with imaging,” said Abraham Kuten of Technion Israel Institute of Technology.

Kuten and his colleagues studied the breath of 177 people — some healthy and some with various types of cancer — to detect the different chemicals emitted from the surface of cancer cells as they grow.

Their findings, published in the British Journal of Cancer, build on earlier research published by scientists at the same institute last year showing that a sensor made with gold nanoparticles could detect lung cancer in breath.",0
"Aug. 9, 2010 -- Researchers have identified a protein ""signature"" in the spinal fluid of patients with Alzheimer's disease, which could represent an important advance in its diagnosis.

The signature was found in the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of 90% of people with a diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease and 72% of people with mild cognitive impairment (MCI) -- a disorder that often progresses to Alzheimer's.

Researchers measured concentrations of three proteins previously identified as potential biological indicators, or biomarkers, for Alzheimer's and MCI: amyloid-beta, tau, and phospho-tau.

Low levels of the amyloid protein amyloid-beta 1-42, along with high levels of total tau and elevated phospho tau 181 (P-tau 181), identified Alzheimer's disease in three independent study groups, Hugo Vanderstichele, PhD, of the Belgian biotech company Innogenetics, tells WebMD.

In one study, this protein signature was also seen in spinal fluid samples from all patients with mild cognitive impairment who progressed to Alzheimer's disease within five years.

""Using this approach, which was totally independent of diagnosis, we were able to identify patients with Alzheimer's disease,"" Vanderstichele says.",1
"Aug. 4, 2010 -- The plant extract resveratrol, found in the skin of red grapes, appears to suppress inflammation and may fight aging in humans, according to a new study.

Common food sources of resveratrol include grapes, wine, peanuts, blueberries, and cranberries.

Study author Husam Ghanim, PhD, of the University of Buffalo says the popular plant extract has been shown to prolong life and reduce the rate of aging in roundworms, fruit flies, and yeast, apparently because resveratrol affects a gene associated with longevity.

Now, Ghanim and colleagues say they have found that resveratrol reduces inflammation in humans that could lead to heart disease, stroke, and type 2 diabetes.

The researchers signed up 20 people and put them at random into two groups, one receiving a placebo and the other a supplement containing 40 milligrams of resveratrol. The volunteers took pills once a day for six weeks.

Fasting blood samples were taken at the start of the trial and then at intervals of one, three, and six weeks.

Results showed that resveratrol suppressed the generation of “free radicals” -- unstable molecules known to cause oxidative stress and release pro-inflammatory substances into the blood, resulting in damage to the blood vessel lining.

People taking resveratrol also showed suppression of the inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor, or TNF, and other compounds that increase blood vessel inflammation and interfere with insulin action, causing insulin resistance and the risk of developing diabetes.

Blood samples from those on placebo showed no significant change in pro-inflammatory markers.",0
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - An infusion of the anesthetic ketamine can lift mood within minutes in patients suffering from severe bipolar depression, according to a small study out this month in the Archives of General Psychiatry.

The 18 patients in the study had tried an average of seven different drugs for treating their bipolar illness, and were still severely depressed; 55 percent had failed electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or shock treatment. But within 40 minutes of receiving a ketamine injection, their depressive symptoms improved; the effect persisted for at least three days.

Right now, medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks, or even months, to work, notes Dr. Carlos A. Zarate Jr. of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland, one of the researchers on the study.

And as a person waits for their medications to kick in, he added, they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life; they may even be having thoughts of suicide. “We want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life,” he said.

Zarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment-resistant unipolar depression, meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes. In the new study, they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart.

All of the patients were on lithium or valproate - two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness - but had not responded to treatment. Nearly all were unemployed, Zarate and his team note, and two-thirds were on psychiatric disability.

Compared to placebo, patients showed significant improvement in mood within 40 minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion, using a common depression rating scale. Symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection, but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days.

Seventy-one percent of the patients responded to ketamine, meaning they had at least a 50 percent improvement in their depressive symptoms. Six percent responded to placebo.

Side effects included anxiety, “feeling woozy or loopy,” headache, and dissociative symptoms, meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality, although there were no serious adverse events. By developing more specifically targeted drugs, Zarate noted, it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms.

Ketamine appears to work by “resetting” the way nerve cells process glutamate, a brain chemical key for learning, memory, and other functions, according to Zarate. The problem in bipolar illness and depression, he explains, doesn’t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate; instead, it’s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack.

First introduced in 1962, ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic. It’s also a drug of abuse, at much higher doses than those used in Zarate’s research; while patients in the current study received about 50 milligrams during a 40-minute period, a dose too low to induce anesthesia, recreational users of ketamine, known as “Special K,” may take hundreds of milligrams per week.

In 1999, US regulators classified ketamine as a Schedule III controlled substance, meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically.

Ketamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways, Zarate said; for example, as a means to jump-start standard drug treatment, or as an anesthetic before ECT. “It’s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research, and all of them are quite encouraging,” said Zarate, who along with a co-author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression. Those rights would be assigned to his employer, the National Institutes of Health.

Efforts are already underway in Europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression, the researcher said.

In the US, research is continuing on the drug, he added, and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren’t helped by standard treatments. But, according to Zarate, more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way.

WEDNESDAY, July 28, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Drinking alcohol may help keep rheumatoid arthritis at bay, possibly because it dampens the body's immune response, new research suggests.

Alcohol consumption may also protect people who already have the autoimmune disease from developing a more debilitating form.

""This actually isn't a new concept. There have been other articles [stating] that alcohol might be protective,"" said Dr. Guy Fiocco, assistant professor of internal medicine at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine and director of rheumatology at Scott & White in Temple, Texas. ""[But] I don't think we're going to be advocating alcohol to prevent rheumatoid arthritis.""

Nor do the study authors advise drinking as a cure for arthritis. ""We would wish to point out that, at the moment, that our findings are preliminary, and would not recommend that patients drink alcohol with the specific purpose of treating their arthritis,"" said Dr. James Maxwell, lead author of the study and a consultant rheumatologist at The Rotherham NHS Foundation Trust in England.

""We would also remind patients to observe recommended government limits for alcohol consumption,"" he added.

According to background information in the study, published online July 28 in Rheumatology, previous studies were mostly conducted in mice. The benefit of ethanol exposure for these rodents seemed to be due to higher levels of testosterone, the researchers wrote.

For this study, the authors compared 1,004 healthy participants to 873 people with rheumatoid arthritis. Both of those groups were divided into four groups: nondrinkers, those who drank 1 to 5 days a month, the ones who drank 6 to 10 days a month, and those who drank more frequently.

""We found that arthritis was progressively less severe as alcohol frequency increased, with a definite difference compared to nondrinkers even in the least frequent alcohol consumption group,"" Maxwell said.

The teetotalers had quadruple the risk of having rheumatoid arthritis compared with those who drank in the highest category.

And the more often one drank, the less damaging the rheumatoid arthritis tended to be, including healthier joints as shown on X-rays and less inflammation.

The association was seen in both men and women, though it was stronger in males.

Although no one can pinpoint a reason for the link with certainty, ""essentially we think that alcohol may be having an effect by reducing the immune response, which leads to joint inflammation, and also that it may have a mild pain-killing effect,"" said Maxwell.

""There's a little information that alcohol can suppress the immune system,"" added Fiocco. ""What's been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels.""

This finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study (that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol).

Because the researchers assessed drinking frequency, rather than the amount of alcohol consumed, it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful, they said.

And Maxwell stressed that their preliminary findings need to be replicated in the future.

""There are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something (such as alcohol) over a period of time,"" Maxwell added. ""We would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis, a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later.""

"Common Diagnostic Test May Prolong Low Back Pain

toggle caption Mads Abildgaard/iStockphoto.com

Coping with an aching back isn't easy. Neither is figuring out the cause of chronic back pain a lot of the time.

But researchers at Johns Hopkins suggest that a common diagnostic technique doesn't help doctors much for patients whose chronic lower back pain appears to be due to arthritis of the joints in the spine.

Doing away with a painkilling injections, or nerve blocks, as a test to determine the root cause of the back pain didn't hurt patients who went on to have their pain treated by zapping nerves with electrodes. Skipping the diagnostic nerve blocks can save $10,000 in medical costs.

The results appear in the August issue of Anesthesiology.

Because the diagnosis of pain can be imprecise, doctors often order multiple tests before treatment. In doing so, they may weed out patients who would actually benefit from treatment, according to the study. Of about 150 patients, the group that got radiofrequency treatment immediately had more people who felt better.

Almost everyone suffering from back pain says something like, ""I want to feel better, I want to play golf again, or I want to be able to play baseball with my grandkids,"" anesthesiologist and lead author Steve P. Cohen tells Shots. Patients don't care much about the finer points of diagnostic accuracy. They just want relief.

But some pain experts defend the value of the diagnostic tests. Dr. Nikolai Bogdu at the Newcastle Bone & Joint Institute in Australia told Reuters that further cost analysis is needed to account for millions of patients who might not get pain relief from the radiofrequency treatment.

The study's suggestion on how to manage back pain also runs counter to current guidelines from major medical groups. The American Chronic Pain Association for example says that a block test determines who should get radiofrequency treatment.

Cohen, who serves as a colonel in the U.S. Army Reserves, tell us he's seen immediate treatment work on soldiers, who need to quickly return to their posts, so there's no reason why skipping straight to radiofrequency treatment shouldn't also work on civilian patients.

Doctors may not change their approach anytime soon, however. For one thing, Cohen says insurance companies typically cover radiofrequency therapy only after a patient has gone through at least one diagnostic test.",1
"One of the most frustrating aspects of brain injuries is that they can be difficult to diagnose; emergency rooms can sometimes miss subtle symptoms, leading to improper treatment and potentially catastrophic consequences. Now, researchers are close to identifying so-called biomarkers that may soon make it possible to pinpoint brain injuries with a simple blood test.

Presence of these biomarkers—proteins produced by an injured brain—could end up determining the future treatment of the estimated 1.4 million athletes, car-crash victims and others in the U.S. who are treated for brain injuries in emergency rooms each year, in addition to hundreds of thousands of soldiers injured in blasts.

A Look at Head Trauma About 1.7 million people annually in the U.S. suffer a traumatic brain injury. Some can lead to long-term difficulties in functioning.

Most common causes among civilians are falls, car crashes and assaults. Blasts can cause brain injuries in soldiers.

About 75% of brain injuries are concussions or ""mild"" brain injuries.

52,000 people in U.S. die from brain injuries annually, and 275,000 are hospitalized.

Most commonly affected age groups are children up to 4 years old, and teens 15 to 19.

More than 3 million Americans have long-term need for help in daily tasks because of brain injury. Sources: U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention; Brain Injury Association of America; WSJ interviews.

The U.S. Defense Department is soon expected to provide $17 million to fund a major study of brain-injury biomarkers in more than 1,000 human patients at 20 hospitals in the U.S. and overseas. The first-of-its-kind study—which is expected to start next year and take 18 months—will explore whether biomarkers can reliably assess the extent of brain injury and help doctors decide on treatment.

""I think this will revolutionize brain-injury care,"" says Col. Dallas Hack, a medical doctor in charge of the U.S. Army's combat casualty treatment. He says the Army's goal is to one day have a portable blood-test device that a medic could carry onto the battlefield.

Doctors frequently fail to diagnose brain injury in patients who've suffered head trauma but remain conscious. Physicians also sometimes can't reliably determine whether a patient in a stupor has a brain injury, a stroke, or something else entirely. As a result, doctors may incorrectly prescribe treatment, or prescribe no treatment where it's actually necessary.

Actress Natasha Richardson died last year after hitting her head in a snow-skiing accident partly because the severity of her injury wasn't recognized quickly enough for her to get proper treatment. Soldiers on the battlefield can appear fine after enduring an explosion but may in fact need rest, treatment or rehabilitation.

Doctors struggle with diagnoses of brain injuries as they once did with diagnoses of heart attacks. Then cardiologists found troponin, a cardiac biomarker that shows up in blood after a heart attack. A blood test helps doctors assess within an hour or two whether a patient with chest pains is actually having an attack. It's more precise than having a patient describe symptoms.

Biomarkers could do the same for brain injury. Researchers are optimistic about work being done at Banyan Biomarkers Inc., a privately held start-up run by former faculty members of the University of Florida.

At the company's lab in Alachua, Fla., anesthetized rats encased in tiny body armor are hit in the head with miniature metal pistons and air blasts. The blows simulate the impacts of accidents or explosions that injure the brain. When the rats awaken, scientists test their blood for the presence of proteins produced by an injured brain.

So far, evidence from lab animals like these and more than 300 human brain-injury patients suggests strong correlations between the degree of brain injury and the level of certain brain biomarkers. Banyan hopes to win approval from the Food and Drug Administration for a blood test, if the planned clinical study being funded by the Defense Department proves successful.

Edward D. Hall, director of the University of Kentucky's brain-injury research program, says the Banyan work does show these biomarkers can reliably track brain injury, and they are found in brain tissue and cerebro-spinal fluid at high enough levels to be reliably detected. But, he said, ""the question is whether they do this in a reliable way in mild injury cases"" through simple blood tests. Other scientists say that Banyan's work may help doctors distinguish between different types of brain injury.

A peer-reviewed study of 66 patients led by Banyan scientists and published this year in the journal Critical Care Medicine showed that patients with the most severe brain injury had levels of a biomarker called UCH-L1 that were 16 times the level found in patients without brain injury.

Banyan scientists this year also published conclusions in the European Journal of Neuroscience that the same chemical, UCH-L1, was sharply elevated in rats with injuries designed to mimic both brain injury and stroke.

Banyan's president and founder, Ronald L. Hayes, says brain injury isn't just an immediate injury, but a disease process that can last for days. During that time, a cascade of biomarker proteins is produced in the brain, suggesting damage continues to occur. Dr. Hayes and his colleagues theorize that early intervention could halt much of this later harm.

Brain injuries are now diagnosed and assessed by checking vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure, then by doctors' checking the patient's thinking, memory and consciousness. They test basic brain functions by checking the size of pupils and how the pupils react to a bright light. They administer pinpricks or other pain or heat stimuli, as well as checking the patient's ability to move arms and legs. CT scans are also used.

Early detection of biomarkers could be particularly helpful at smaller hospitals where doctors might not be trained to deal with a severe brain injury. If they realized through a simple blood test that they confronted a potentially devastating injury, they might rush the patient to a hospital that has a neuro-intensive care unit. There, specialists could place pressure monitors in the brain and lessen intra-cranial pressure that can destroy brain tissue. They also could alleviate ""vasospasms,"" storms within the brain that can be just as damaging as the original injury.

TUESDAY, July 20, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- The cancer drug Avastin, when used in combination with standard chemotherapy, is safe and can effectively treat an advanced form of one of the most common lung cancers, researchers report.

Previously it had been thought that this combination might have serious adverse side effects, including life-threatening bleeding, for patients with non-squamous non-small-cell lung tumors. However, this phase 4 trial, which used Avastin (bevacizumab) plus chemotherapy in a large population found these problems were minimal.

Phase 4 trials are done after a drug is on the market, to look for any new problems.

""Today we have a new option to treat non-squamous lung cancer, incorporating Avastin in chemotherapy regimens and in maintenance therapy,"" said lead researcher Dr. Lucio Crino, director of medical oncology at S. Maria della Misericordia Hospital in Perugia, Italy.

""The practical implication is the possibility to incorporate Avastin with any chemotherapy regimen in the frontline therapy of metastatic non-squamous lung cancer,"" he added.

The report, which is funded by the maker of Avastin, F Hoffman-La Roche Ltd., is published in the July 20 issue of The Lancet Oncology. The funder was involved in study design, coordination of data collection, data analysis, data interpretation, and writing of the report, the journal noted.

Advanced non-small-cell lung cancer is a common cancer that kills 1.18 million people every year worldwide, according to background information in the study. Avastin is a so-called monoclonal antibody that works by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor A, which stimulates the growth of the tumor's blood supply.

When used as an adjunct to chemotherapy, Avastin had already shown cancer-fighting activity in two phase 3 trials, the researchers noted.

For the study, Crino's team studied Avastin in more than 2,200 patients with advanced or recurrent non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer. The patients were treated at centers in 40 countries around the world.

These patients were given the drug every three weeks along with standard chemotherapy, for up to six cycles. Patients were then treated with Avastin alone until the cancer began to progress (""maintenance"" therapy).

The researchers reported few clinically significant adverse events, meaning that most were no greater than what one would expect in the general population. One percent of patients experienced bleeding in the lungs and 4 percent had bleeding, Crino's group found.

Overall, 3 percent of the patients died due to adverse events associated with Avastin. These included 1 percent who had blood clots and 1 percent who suffered bleeding.

Other serious adverse events associated with Avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds, low white blood cell counts, fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis (DVT), all of which occurred in 1 percent of the patients.

Dr. Robert Pirker, from the department of medicine at the Medical University of Vienna in Austria, and author of an accompanying journal editorial, said that Avastin ""can be safely given when certain precautions are taken.""

However, several issues remain to be determined, including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with Avastin, he said.

""In addition, it is unknown whether bevacizumab [Avastin] increases survival when added to cisplatin-based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non-squamous non-small-cell lung cancer,"" Pirker said.

Overall, Avastin, like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer, he added. ""Hurdles in clinical development do occur but -- as shown for bevacizumab -- can be overcome,"" Pirker said.

Another expert, Dr. Norman H. Edelman, chief medical officer at the American Lung Association, and professor of preventive medicine, internal medicine, physiology & biophysics at Stony Brook University in New York, called the study ""very good bread-and-butter clinical research.""

The efficacy of the drug has been proven previously, he noted, but this study provides an in-depth analysis of Avastin's safety profile under ""real life"" conditions, he added.

""Too often this step is shortcircuited in the rush to market of a new drug and we have to await the laborious collection of after-market data to find the real dangers of many new drugs,"" Edelman said.

""So, the researchers and sponsors are to be congratulated for doing this study. They find that there are real deleterious side effects but that they are manageable, and conclude the drug is worth using under the proper circumstances,"" he said.

Avastin is in the spotlight Tuesday for another reason, as well. U.S. regulators could rescind approval of the drug for the treatment of breast cancer, based on follow-up studies reported Friday that failed to show the medication shrank tumors or extended lives, according to published reports.

The Food and Drug Administration on Tuesday will ask a panel of outside experts to review the evidence on the Roche drug, the Associated Press said. It's possible the FDA will withdraw approval of Avastin as a breast cancer treatment.

The drug is also approved for lung, colon, brain and kidney cancer.

"Hate needles? Flu patch may take sting out of your fears

In what would be a boon for needle-phobes of all ages, researchers have developed a skin patch that vaccinates against the flu and could be available in five years.

The patch, which is lined with microscopic needles that dissolve into the skin, could provide a painless alternative to hypodermic needles and make visits to the doctor's office or clinic for a traditional flu shot a thing of the past. The patch is as easy to apply as a Band-Aid.

""We've now demonstrated a technology that can enable painless, self-administered flu vaccination,"" said Mark Prausnitz, a professor in the Georgia Tech School of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering and leader in the research. ""It appears to vaccinate against influenza at least as well and probably better than a traditional hypodermic needle.""

Vaccination that doesn't require trained personnel holds great appeal because it would likely boost the nation's low immunization rates, a source of concern.

Although influenza kills more than 30,000 people most years and the government recommends most healthy people get vaccinated annually, fewer than 40 percent typically do.

Tested on mice

In a mouse study reported Sunday in the online edition of Nature Medicine, Prausnitz's team found the patch improved the immune system's antibody memory and was more efficient at clearing the lungs of the flu virus, compared to a placebo and hypodermic needle-delivered vaccine.

Prausnitz attributed the better performance to the skin's abundance of the types of cells most adept at generating immune responses. The muscle into which needles deliver vaccine is not nearly as active immunologically.

Patches in the mouse study contained an array of 100 needles, each some 650 microns in length, or about the width of a few strands of human hair. Coated with inactivated flu virus, the patches are pressed manually into the skin, where the microneedles dissolve into bodily fluids.

""It's a technological approach that makes a lot of sense,"" said Dr. Jan Drutz, a general pediatrician at Texas Children's Hospital who calls needle-phobia common in both kids and adults. ""It would be a wonderful alternative to needles if it truly works in people and is pain free.""

Fights flu better

Needle-phobia, or trypanophobia, is a recognized medical condition that causes sufferers to avoid medical care. It is estimated to affect more than 10 percent of the adult population.

In the study, one group of mice received the influenza vaccine from traditional hypodermic needles; another group received the vaccine through the dissolving microneedles; and a control group received the microneedle patches not containing any vaccine.

Infected with the influenza virus 30 days later, both groups that received the vaccine remained healthy while mice in the control group contracted the flu and died.

Three months after vaccination, researchers exposed a different group of immunized mice to the flu virus and found that those who received the microneedles did better than those injected by the hypodermic needles.

Testing on people next

Noting that mice are much easier to vaccinate against the flu than humans, Baylor College of Medicine influenza expert Dr. Paul Glezen expressed skepticism about the patch until seeing it in human trials. But he said it will be interesting to watch.

Prausnitz said he hopes to be testing the patch in people in two years and have a product on the shelves in five. He also said that although initially there will be start-up costs, he thinks the price will be no more than traditional flu vaccines once it is mass-produced.

The microneedle technology may also be used for other vaccinations, such as polio and measles, said Prausnitz. He said his team is working on those diseases but is not as far along.

"The drug MDMA—better known by its street name, Ecstasy—may be illegal, but a new study suggests that it’s also a promising treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder.

The study, which appears in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, included 20 people with PTSD stemming from traumas such as sexual assault and combat stress. On two separate occasions, 12 of the people took a dose of MDMA and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists. The others took a placebo but received the same therapy. (All of the participants received additional therapy sessions that did not involve the drug.)

Two months later, 10 of the 12 people who took MDMA had improved to the point where they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and three participants whose condition had prevented them from holding down a job were able to return to work.

By contrast, just two of the eight people in the placebo group experienced a substantial improvement in their symptoms.

MDMA is believed to raise levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin and the so-called ""bonding hormone,"" oxytocin. The resulting sense of euphoria and emotional warmth seems to help patients connect with their therapists, says Michael Mithoefer, M.D., the lead author of the study and a Mount Pleasant, South Carolina-based psychiatrist who specializes in PTSD.

""A lot of the time, people have quite painful and challenging experiences revisiting the trauma, and [MDMA] can help them do it without being overwhelmed or numbed out,"" he says.

Don't try this experiment at home. Ecstasy use can cause depression, severe anxiety, and potential cognitive problems, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. And when purchased on the street it can be contaminated.

Conducting a study with an illegal drug is a complex process. This was the first clinical trial to explore the therapeutic potential of MDMA since the drug was outlawed in 1985, and the researchers required the permission of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration , and the Drug Enforcement Administration.

""It took quite a bit of time to get approval,"" Mithoefer says.

The study was funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a California-based nonprofit organization that also sponsors research on medical marijuana and psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin.

The use of MDMA in psychotherapy has been studied for decades, but research in the U.S. all but ground to a halt after the drug became illegal.

Mithoefer and his team are now gearing up for a similar study involving combat veterans, which is scheduled to begin later this year.",1

Implanted in the patient’s chest after the diseased heart is removed, it uses information gleaned from sensors to mimic the activity of the natural organ. It is operated by a microcontroller and powered by electromagnetic induction through the skin or through a plug implanted behind the patient’s ear.

Carmat estimates its device will cost $176,000 to $226,000. When all expenses are considered, including hospital and surgical expenses, it says it will cost just over $315,000, about the same as a transplant.

The device was developed over 15 years by a team that included Alain F. Carpentier, the French surgeon-scientist who, along with Albert Starr, received the 2007 Albert Lasker Award for Clinical Medical Research. The Lasker Foundation, which is based in New York, praised their work in the development of artificial heart valves, saying they had “prolonged and enhanced the lives of millions of people with heart disease.”

In the November 2009 bulletin of the Académie Nationale de Médecine, Dr. Carpentier wrote that, instead of picking up from older models of artificial hearts built on animal research, the developers of the new device had sought to use the tools of the digital revolution, namely computer-assisted design, hemodynamic modeling, regulation algorithms and simulations.

The French company is not the first to make total artificial hearts, which are meant to completely replace damaged and diseased organs.

SynCardia, based in Tucson, currently makes the only approved temporary artificial heart, having continued development of the groundbreaking Jarvik-7, which Dr. William C. DeVries implanted in a retired dentist named Barney B. Clark in 1982. Its device, powered by a small air compressor that can be carried in a backpack, has been implanted in more than 800 patients as a bridge before transplant.

Abiomed, a company based in Danvers, Mass., makes a self-contained total artificial heart, the electrical-powered AbioCor. The United States Food and Drug Administration has designated the AbioCor as a “humanitarian use device,” meaning its use is restricted to people who are ineligible for transplants and would otherwise be facing imminent death.

Others are in development. In the United States, the National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, a unit of the National Institutes of Health, is supporting efforts by two separate groups, one led by Dr. O. H. Frazier of the Texas Heart Institute in Houston, the other by Dr. Leonard A. R. Golding of the Cleveland Clinic.

Another device is being developed by scientists at the Helmholtz-Institute for Biomedical Engineering at the University of Aachen in Germany.

“There’s definitely a major need for a permanent, total artificial heart,” Laman A. Gray Jr., the University of Louisville professor of surgery who implanted the first AbioCor heart in 2001, said.

Citing World Health Organization data that shows heart disease is the world’s leading cause of death, Mr. Conviti, the Carmat chief executive, estimated the potential market at “a minimum” of 100,000 patients a year in the United States and Europe. However, he said cost constraints meant it was unlikely that more than one-tenth of those patients would actually receive an artificial heart.",1
"July 14, 2010 -- An experimental weight loss drug that targets the brain’s hunger center was shown to be safe and effective for helping dieters shed pounds in a two-year study, researchers say. The drug lorcaserin works on the serotonin receptor -- the same appetite-controlling hormone targeted by the notorious drug fenfluramine, the ""fen"" component of combination medication fen-phen. Fenfluramine was taken off the market in 1997 after being linked to potentially life-threatening heart valve problems. But lorcaserin is far more selective than the drug fenfluramine and much safer, its manufacturer says, because it specifically targets the serotonin receptor associated with hunger while having no impact on the heart.

Half Lost 5% of Body Weight About half the dieters who took lorcaserin for a year in the study lost at least 5% of their body weight, compared to 20% of dieters who took a placebo pill. About one in five lorcaserin users lost 10% or more of their body weight, compared to one out of 14 placebo users. People who continued on the drug for two years were able to maintain their weight loss better than those switched to placebo after one year, researcher Steven R. Smith, MD, of the Florida Hospital and the Sanford-Burnham Institute tells WebMD. He says that all the patients in the study were monitored closely for heart valve irregularities, and no difference was seen in the two treatment groups. The study appears in the July 15 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. It was funded by Arena Pharmaceuticals, Inc., which developed lorcaserin. The company hopes to win FDA approval to market the new drug later this year.

Diet Drug Users Lost Twice as Much Weight The study included about 3,200 obese or overweight adults who were randomly assigned to take 10 milligrams of the diet drug or placebo, twice a day for a year. All the participants were counseled about diet and exercise. By the end of year one, 55% of the patients in the placebo group and 45% of those taking the diet drug had dropped out of the study.",1
"Although the scans looked promising, the companies needed to show that what they revealed was the same as what a pathologist would see on autopsy.

That was what Avid demonstrated with its study, presented Sunday by its medical director, Dr. Christopher M. Clark.

Dr. P. Murali Doraiswamy, a biological psychiatrist at Duke who had helped recruit patients for the study, called the results among “ the most highly anticipated data from the entire meeting.”

To compare the scans with autopsy results, the company scanned the brains of 35 people in hospices who were expected to die within six months. Some had Alzheimer’s and others did not. After the patients died, their brains were shipped to Phoenix, where a pathologist sliced them into about 100 tiny pieces and sent them off for analysis of plaque.

Pathologists in Montreal analyzed the brain slices with a computer that counted plaques. Independently, pathologists in Chicago analyzed them the traditional way — by looking at the brain slices under a microscope and manually counting the microscopic plaques.

Meanwhile, in Philadelphia, radiologists examined the scans and calculated how much plaque was present in the patients’ brains and, independently, used a computer to analyze the amount of plaque in the scans. Neither the radiologists nor the pathologists knew whether the patients had dementia.

In 34 of the 35 patients, the PET scan, the pathologists’ report and the computerized pathology report agreed. In one patient who had Alzheimer’s, the pathologist and the radiologist analyzing the scan did not see much plaque, but the computerized analysis of the scan and the two autopsy reports did.

And the data showed that the scans were completely accurate in ruling out Alzheimer’s pathology: unlike doctors, they never said people had Alzheimer’s pathology when they did not.

In addition, the company scanned the brains of 76 younger people who would not be expected to have plaque in their brains. None did.

“That was very reassuring,” said Dr. Michael W. Weiner, an Alzheimer’s expert at the University of California, San Francisco.

Dr. Reisa A. Sperling, an Alzheimer’s expert at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and co-chairwoman of the session where the results were presented, said, “Personally, I found the data quite convincing.”

Dr. Sperling, an investigator on a different AVID study but who is not paid by the company, said the challenge now will be to see whether the scans can accurately predict whether people are developing Alzheimer’s before they have symptoms.

That is the stage, she said, “where we have the best chance of changing the course of the illness.”",1

TUESDAY, July 13, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A leading group of cancer experts has issued new guidelines on the best way to use two classes of hormone therapies for estrogen receptor-positive breast cancer, the most common form of breast tumor.

After a systematic review of medical research on the subject, experts reported that adding an aromatase inhibitor -- a drug that reduces the amount of estrogen produced in the body -- has clearly been shown to reduce the number of tumor recurrences in postmenopausal women compared with the standard drug tamoxifen, which works by blocking the action of estrogen on cancer tumors that are estrogen-receptor positive.

The committee preparing the guidelines recommended, therefore, that all postmenopausal women with this type of breast cancer use aromatase inhibitors either before or after tamoxifen.

They also concluded that women could use them as long as five years after tamoxifen therapy to lower their risk that the cancer will reoccur.

The paper, issued by the American Society of Clinical Oncologists (ASCO) and published July 12 in the Journal of Clinical Oncology essentially brings guidelines in alignment with today's practice.

""This is actually reinforcing clinical practice,"" said Dr. Crystal Denlinger, assistant professor of medical oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ""In general, for postmenopausal women, we are offering them aromatase inhibitors based on the single studies that have been referenced [in these guidelines] and what has already been reported in national meetings.""

Those studies and presentations, added Denlinger, ""have uniformly demonstrated the superiority of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen or a switching strategy or an extended strategy.""

The new guidelines replace previous guidelines issued in 2002, and subsequent updates in 2003 and 2004.

Tamoxifen has been a mainstay of treatment for decades, while aromatase inhibitors are a more recent entry into the field. Both drugs are used as ""adjuvant"" therapy, meaning they are used after surgery and chemotherapy and/or radiation to prevent the cancer from coming back.

The committee reviewed recent studies which had investigated aromatase inhibitors and/or tamoxifen in women with this particular subtype of breast cancer.

Using an aromatase inhibitor alone or with tamoxifen therapy improved disease-free survival compared with using tamoxifen alone. It also reduced the risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body.

Women who are pre- or peri-menopausal when they are diagnosed should be given tamoxifen for five years. Aromatase inhibitors are not effective in this age group, the experts note.

All three aromatase inhibitors on the market - Arimidex (anastrozole), Femara (letrozole) and Aromasin (exemestane) - were essentially equal in their benefit.

The drugs can also cause side effects that need to be taken into account when prescribing.

""We've learned a huge amount about the various side effect profiles of these products,"" said Dr. Harold J. Burstein, co-chair of the ASCO committee which prepared the guidelines and associate professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. ""Aromatase inhibitors are clearly associated with osteoporosis and with bone and joint [conditions]. They might also be associated with a greater risk of hypertension and high cholesterol.""

For its part, tamoxifen is also associated with serious side effects, which can include cataracts and uterine cancer as well as life-threatening blood clots and stroke.

And cost will also be a factor in decision-making.

""Aromatase inhibitors are very expensive. And sometimes we have to make decisions about using drugs that are probably a little less effective but at the same time we have to take into account the financial standpoint,"" said Dr. Jay Brooks, chairman of hematology/oncology at Ochsner Health System in Baton Rouge. ""Are [aromatase inhibitors] better than tamoxifen? Yes, in two areas: preventing recurrent disease in other parts of the body and in preventing a second, separate breast cancer. But the [financial] costs are much more expensive.""

According to the new guidelines, 20 milligrams of tamoxifen costs $21.90 a month, while Arimidex can cost $379.80.

On the other hand, Burstein pointed out, the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole recently became available as a generic, which should lower the cost significantly.

"Steve Horrell / SPL / Getty Images A cholesterol home test

A new study finds that current guidelines for cholesterol screening in children may miss nearly 10% of those who have high levels of LDL, or bad cholesterol.

The question of how soon children should be screened for high cholesterol is becoming increasingly important in the U.S., with its rate of child obesity topping 20%. Along with obesity, high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems, including diabetes.

The U.S. government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol (with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke, or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above 240 mg/dL). The guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened. (See how to prevent illness at any age.)

In the new study, led by Dr. William Neal of West Virginia University, scientists observed a group of more than 20,000 fifth-graders in West Virginia and found that 71% were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria. Experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol  and therefore of future heart disease. Based on the results of the screen, doctors may then advise families to change their children's diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol.

But because West Virginia has one of the nation's highest rates of death from heart disease, since 2000, the state has offered free, universal cholesterol screening to all fifth-graders enrolled in public schools. That allowed Neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines. (See TIME's special report on how to live 100 years.)

Among the 5,798 children who would not have been screened, nearly 10% had elevated LDL cholesterol levels (above 130 mg/dL), according to the study, published in the August issue of Pediatrics. And 1.7% had levels high enough (above 160 mg/dL) to warrant cholesterol-lowering medications. Indeed, of all the children in the study whose LDL levels were above 160, one-third were in the group who would not have been screened.

The current guidelines were put in place in the 1990s, and at the time, experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as 25% of children, says Neal. But doctors assumed that in most cases, these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise.

Neal's data show that may not be the case. Further, Neal says, the findings apply not only to heart-disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes, since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes. ""We worry about that because if these children don't change their ways, then they are going to have Type 2 diabetes,"" he says. ""It's something we would become more aware of if more children were screened.""

Not everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer. Rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested, which would entail considerable expense on the national level, Dr. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association (AHA), suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines. ""Maybe the way we are doing family screening, with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol, is not effective,"" he says. ""I think we need more effective screening tools. We need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening.""

Sacco notes that both the AHA and the American Academy of Pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history, such as obesity, high blood pressure and diabetes. ""The weight of the child, his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol,"" he says. ""Now that we have this data, it does call into question these original guidelines from the government."" The next update of the recommendations is expected in spring 2011.

"Back in April the WSJ wrote about the race to develop ways of detecting Alzheimer's disease using a brain scan. Currently only a post-mortem sampling of brain tissue can provide a definitive diagnosis. But the hope is that a technology that could be used in living patients could help rule out Alzheimer's in some patients and for those that have the disease, allow its symptoms to be treated more quickly. (The progress of the disease itself cannot be slowed.)

The general idea is to inject a compound into a patient containing molecules that bind to the amyloid plaques that are characteristic of Alzheimer's. Because the compound also contains a radioactive marker, it makes plaques visible on a PET scan.

Now there's good news about one of the technologies the WSJ has written about, a compound called florbetapir developed by Avid Radiopharmaceuticals. A study abstract released at a meeting of Alzheimer's researchers shows a strong association between the results of those brain scans and the actual location of plaques determined after death, Bloomberg News reports.

Another study presented at the conference looked at people with mild cognitive impairment, which can precede Alzheimer's. It found that 22% of patients with plaques identified using florbetapir (vs. 3% of those without plaques) progressed to full-blown Alzheimer's within a year, Bloomberg reports.

Avid's CEO told Bloomberg the company would apply for FDA approval of the compound this year. As the WSJ reported earlier, the Alzheimer's diagnostic and biomarker market is expected to reach $2.8 billion in 2014, up from $1.1 billion last year. Bayer and GE are also developing diagnostic compounds to be used in tandem with imaging.

"July 7, 2010 -- The FDA says it has approved the use of micro-sized implantable telescopes to improve vision in patients with end-stage, age-related macular degeneration.

The tiny device, called an Implantable Miniature Telescope (IMT), is designed to replace the natural lens. It provides an image that has been magnified more than two times, the FDA says in a news release.

Age-related macular degeneration (AMD) is a condition that affects older people. It damages the center of the retina, or macula, and results in a loss of vision in the center of the visual field. There are two forms of AMD, a wet form and a dry form.

About 8 million people in the U.S. suffer from this condition, and nearly 2 million of them already have significant loss of vision. The device is intended for patients 75 and older with severe to profound vision impairment that has been stable over time due to blind spots from end-stage AMD.

""This innovation has the potential to provide many people with an improved quality of life,"" Jeffrey Shuren, MD, JD, director of the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health, says in the news release.

The IMT comes in two models; one model provides 2.2 times magnification and the other 2.7 times. It is designed to magnify and project images onto a healthy portion of the afflicted person's retina. It is intended for use in only one eye because the other eye is used for peripheral vision, the FDA says.

Before implantation, patients will be trained with an external telescopic device to see if they may benefit from the product. Training would also be needed to verify that there is sufficient peripheral vision in the untreated eye.

The miniature telescope was developed by VisionCare Ophthalmic Technologies Inc. of Saratoga, Calif.

""This is truly a breakthrough technology for AMD patients as their treatment options have been limited until now,"" says Kathryn A. Colby, MD, PhD, an ophthalmic surgeon at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary in Boston and an assistant professor of ophthalmology at Harvard Medical School.",1

WEDNESDAY, June 30, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Adding to the ongoing debate on the usefulness of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test for prostate cancer, new research from Sweden finds the screen cuts lives lost to the disease by almost half.

The argument over whether PSA screening saves men's lives or merely leads to the overdiagnosis of very slow-growing cancers (with attendant worry and overtreatment) has bedeviled the medical world for years.

According to recently revised guidelines from the American Cancer Society, men at average risk for prostate cancer should discuss the PSA test with their doctor, starting at age 50. For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45.

""Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,"" the society notes on its Web site.

Ambivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States.

""In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,"" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg.

However, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, ""it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,"" Hugosson added.

The report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology.

For the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study.

Men whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies.

Over 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened.

Among screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted.

In addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found.

""Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,"" Hugosson said.

Moreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted.

Dr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, ""PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease.""

This study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains ""a blunt instrument,"" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. ""We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,"" he said.

In the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City.

""I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,"" he said. ""So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done.""

Stone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. ""When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,"" he said.

""Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,"" Stone said. ""This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths.""

Another expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that ""people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all."" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.

"June 30, 2010 -- A drug used in Europe as emergency contraception may also treat painful uterine fibroids, researchers say.

Their study was presented at the 26th annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome, Italy.

As many as 80% of all women have uterine fibroids (noncancerous growths in the uterus), according to the nonprofit National Uterine Fibroids Foundation. Fibroids may cause severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, and interfere with fertility in some women. Surgery is often the only way to treat painful, bleeding fibroids, but surgery too can sometimes compromise fertility.

Enter EllaOne, a member of a new class of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators. As of now, EllaOne is used in Europe as a morning-after pill because it blocks the effects of key hormones -- namely progesterone -- involved in ovulation. It is effective for up to five days after unprotected sex. Although EllaOne is not available in the U.S., an FDA advisory panel recently voted that it should be. The new drug is manufactured by HRA Pharma, a European pharmaceutical company, which provided funding for the new study. The hormone progesterone also feeds uterine fibroids, so blocking its effects may help treat painful fibroids.",1
"* Average reductions of 0.8 pct seen in levels of A1C

* Better glucose control recorded over 1-year period

CHICAGO, June 29 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc’s (MDT.N) insulin pump and monitoring device controlled blood glucose levels better than multiple daily injections in patients with Type 1 diabetes, according to a large post-market study.

Adult and pediatric patients using the pump and continuous glucose monitoring device saw reductions in levels of A1C, a commonly used measure of blood sugar, that were four times greater than those who received regular insulin injections in the study of 485 patients ranging from age 7 to 70.

Lowering A1C levels helps reduce the risk of long-term complications from diabetes such as eye, kidney and heart disease.

Patients in the study, which was presented at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando, Florida, and sponsored by Medtronic, achieved better glucose control over a one-year period without an increase in hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar.

“What we’ve been able to show is that by combining this technology, you can lower the A1C, which reduces your risk of complications, and you can do it safely without increasing your rate of hypoglycemia,” said study author Dr. Richard Bergenstal, executive director of the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis.

Multiple daily injections remain the most common approach to controlling blood sugar levels. Bergenstal said patients who are not achieving their goals with multiple daily injections should consider using a pump and sensor.

Diabetes association guidelines recommend that most people with diabetes maintain A1C levels of 7.0 percent or below.

In the study, patients on pump therapy saw a reduction in average A1C levels of 0.8 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent average reduction for those who received multiple injections. A1C levels on average decreased to 7.5 percent from a baseline of 8.3 percent in the group on pump therapy, but decreased to just 8.1 percent in the group receiving multiple injections.

"June 28, 2010 -- Cholesterol-lowering statin drugs appear to reduce the risk for prostate cancer recurrence in patients who have had a surgical procedure called radical prostatectomy.

In a new study from Duke University Medical Center, men who took statins for their hearts were 30% less likely to have their cancers come back after their prostates were removed than men who did not take the drugs.

Those who took the highest doses saw their recurrence risk drop by half.

The research does not prove that taking cholesterol-lowering drugs directly slows the growth and progression of prostate cancer. But the fact that the fewest recurrences were seen in men who took the highest statin doses is compelling, says senior investigator Stephen J. Freedland, MD, of the Duke Prostate Center.

“Statin users may see their doctors more often and may be more health conscious in general, and it has been suggested that this could explain the observed reduction in risk,” Freedland tells WebMD. “If this is the case, dosage shouldn’t matter. But that is not what we found.”",1

SUNDAY, June 27, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- New research suggests that artificial pancreas technology can help diabetics gain greater blood sugar control overnight, even when they have eaten a big meal or had wine for dinner.

The promise of this emerging technology is to free diabetics from the need to constantly monitor their blood sugar levels by letting a computer program do the job -- constantly adjusting glucose and insulin levels as needed. Using this technology is still seen as a stopgap, however, while a biological solution to diabetes is sought.

""We have pioneered the development of a closed-loop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type 1 and type 2 diabetes, by providing exquisite control of blood sugar,"" Dr. Richard A. Insel, executive vice president for research at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation (JDRF), said during a noon teleconference Saturday.

A symposium on advances in the technology -- co-sponsored by the American Diabetes Association and the JDRF -- is slated for Sunday as part of the American Diabetes Association's annual meeting, in Orlando, Fla.

For people with type 1 diabetes, controlling their blood sugar levels is a full-time job. Too much insulin can cause low blood sugar (hypoglycemia), which can be life-threatening, while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney, vision and circulation problems.

""The promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of long-term diabetic complications, but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event, and further help people with diabetes live easier,"" Aaron Kowalski, research director of the JDRF's Artificial Pancreas Project, said during the teleconference.

""This will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach, which will take longer,"" he said.

In the first report, Dr. Roman Hovorka, a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the University of Cambridge, reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia. With the technology, patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for 70 percent of the time, compared to 47 percent of the time among those not using the technology.

Moreover, glucose control was demonstrated in real-life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine.

""We let them consume about three-quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal,"" Hovorka said during Saturday's teleconference. ""What has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning.""

These results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels, he added. ""We reduced hypoglycemia by half,"" he said.

""Our plan is to move into home studies, which hopefully will happen later on this year,"" Hovorka said.

Meanwhile, Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at the Joslin Diabetes Center and an assistant professor of psychology at the Harvard Medical School, reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring.

""So far, studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring [CGM],"" she said during the teleconference.

Ritholz's team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control.

Frustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device. ""We found that the people who did well used a more problem-solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the CGM,"" she said.

People who were not successful used ""emotion-based coping,"" Ritholz said. ""They easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up.""

In addition, successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or ""significant other,"" she added. All patients felt self-conscious wearing the device, Ritholz noted.

""We know that CGM success or failure is as dependent on the human experience as it is on the perfection of the technology,"" she said.

Speaking at the Saturday teleconference, Dr. William Tamborlane, chief of pediatric endocrinology at Yale University School of Medicine and co-chair of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation's Continuous Glucose Monitoring Group, said the system only works if worn almost every day.

Studies have shown that children and adults over 25 who used CGM were able to reduce their blood sugar levels. However, teenagers did not see a benefit, probably because they were less likely to wear the device, Tamborlane said.

People who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement, regardless of age, he added.

To get more people to use CGM, ""the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices,"" he said.

Artificial pancreas technology combines CGM with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver.

The device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type 1 diabetes -- insulin, which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal, and glucagon, a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low.

However, the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed.

"LONDON (Reuters) - Iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause, offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance.

The test, which measures levels of a hormone produced by cells in the ovaries, was able to predict the age at which women reached menopause to within an average of 4 months, according to data to be presented at the conference of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome on Monday.

“The results ... could enable us to make a more realistic assessment of women’s reproductive status many years before they reach menopause,” said Ramezani Tehrani of the Shahid Beheshti University of Medical Sciences in Tehran, who led the study.

Experts commenting on the work agreed it was promising, but said its findings would need to be confirmed in larger trials.

“The possibility of an accurate predictor for menopause is very exciting. People have been looking for something like this for years,” said Dagan Wells of the Nuffield Department of Obstetrics and Gynaecology at Oxford University.

The average age for menopause is 51, with ovulation in most women ending sometime between age 40 and 60. But it can happen later or earlier, making it difficult for women who want to develop a career before having babies to know how long to wait.

Tehrani’s team took blood samples from 266 women aged between 20 and 49 who were also taking part in another study called the Tehran Lipid and Glucose Study, which started in 1998.

They then measured concentrations of a hormone called the anti-Mullerian Hormone (AMH) that is produced by cells in women’s ovaries. AMH controls the development of follicles in the ovaries from which eggs develop, and the scientists suspected it might be useful for judging ovarian function.

STATISTICAL MODEL

The researchers took two more blood samples at three yearly intervals and also collected information on the women’s socioeconomic background and reproductive history.

“We developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a single measurement of AMH concentration,” Tehrani explained in a report on the study. “Using this model, we estimated mean average ages at menopause for women at different time points in their reproductive life span.”

Tehrani said the results showed “a good level of agreement” between predicted and actual age at menopause for the 63 women in the group who reached menopause during the study.

The average difference between the predicted age and the women’s actual age at menopause was a third of a year, and the maximum margin of error was three to four years.

Wells said Tehrani’s team appeared to have hit upon a “fairly accurate algorithm” for predicting menopause.

But said it would be important to see if the method could also help predict the time when fertility effectively ends.

“A woman may cease monthly ovulation and experience menopause at 50, but she will probably have been effectively infertile for several years prior to this,” he said. “It will be important to let patients know that fertility will have declined greatly in the years preceding the final ovulation.”",1
"Ever since Alzheimer’s disease was described by a German doctor, Alois Alzheimer, in 1906, there was only one way to know for sure that a person had it. A pathologist, examining the brain after death, would see microscopic black freckles, plaque, sticking to brain slices like barnacles. Without plaque, a person with memory loss did not have the disease.

There is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer’s. But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work, particularly if they are started early. The questions though, are who should be getting the drugs and who really has Alzheimer’s or is developing it?

Even at the best medical centers, doctors often are wrong. Twenty percent of people with dementia — a loss of memory and intellectual functions — who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer’s, did not have it. There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Half with milder memory loss, thought to be on their way to Alzheimer’s, do not get the disease. And with such a high rate of misdiagnosis, some who are mistakenly told that they have Alzheimer’s are not treated for conditions, like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions, that are causing their memory problems.

Brain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions — who has or is getting Alzheimer’s, whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death.

Dr. Skovronsky thought he had a way to make scans work. He and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque. They labeled the dye with a commonly used radioactive tracer and used a PET scanner to directly see plaque in a living person’s brain. But the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested.

And that is what brought Dr. Skovronsky, a thin and eager-looking 37-year-old, to his e-mail that recent day.

Five years ago, Dr. Skovronsky, who named his company Avid in part because that is what he is, had taken a big personal and professional gamble. He left academia and formed Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, based in Philadelphia , to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with hospice patients to prove it worked.

Hospice patients were going to die soon and so, he reasoned, why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see. Some patients would be demented, others not.

Some predicted his study would be impossible, if not unethical. But the F.D.A. said it wanted proof that the plaque on PET scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy.

The Avid study was designed to provide that proof. And the full results, contained in the e-mail message sent that day, May 14, were the moment of truth. When he saw them, Dr. Skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for.

“This is about as good as it gets,” he said that day.

He went into a rotunda that serves as Avid’s lunchroom to tell the company’s 50 employees. “This is a big day for us,” he continued. “I thought about what I would say, but I have totally forgotten it.”

His employees applauded. Then they had champagne in blue plastic cups.

A First Dye

The type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan.

Other tests are being studied — ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; MRI scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer’s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy.

Earlier this decade, two scientists at the University of Pittsburgh developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use, stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain.

The researchers, Chester Mathis and William Klunk, began their work two decades ago, persevering even though they had no research money. In the first 10 years, they tested more than 400 compounds. When they finally found one that seemed promising, they tested more than 300 variations.

“On and on it went,” Dr. Mathis said.

Finally, in late 2001, they began working with collaborators in Sweden to test their dye in humans.

On Valentine’s Day 2002, the Swedish researchers injected the first Alzheimer’s patient with the dye, known as Pittsburgh Compound B, and scanned the patient’s brain.

It worked, the Swedish doctors told Dr. Mathis in an excited phone call.

A PET scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected. The Swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque. They told Dr. Mathis it was time to celebrate.

But Dr. Mathis worried. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer’s?

Two weeks later, he got another call from Sweden. His colleagues had scanned a person without Alzheimer’s. There was no sign of telltale plaques.

His sweet reward came in July 2002, when the scans were shown to an audience of 5,000 scientists at an international conference on Alzheimer’s.

“There was an audible gasp,” Dr. Mathis said. “The field was taken aback.”

“The rest is history,” he added.

Yet there was a problem. Pittsburgh Compound B used carbon 11 as its radioactive tracer. And its half-life is 20 minutes. Researchers have to make it in a cyclotron in the basement of a medical center, quickly attach it to the dye, dash over to a patient lying in a scanner, and inject it.

And a critical question remained: Was a PET scan with the Pittsburgh dye really equivalent to a brain autopsy?

Meanwhile, others, including Dr. Skovronsky, had another idea — use fluorine 18, with a half-life of about two hours. It could be made in the morning, and used that afternoon. And fluorine 18 is made routinely for two million cancer PET scans each year.

Dr. Skovronsky, starting at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Avid, worked with a University of Pennsylvania chemist, Hank Kung, for nine years to find and develop the radioactive dye. The university had the patent; Avid licensed it. Finally, on June 8, 2007, a patient at Johns Hopkins had a scan with their compound. Plaque lit up.

Most of the time, the scans were as expected — those with Alzheimer’s had lots of plaque, those with normal memories had little if any and those with mild memory impairment were in between.

But about 20 percent of people over 60 with normal memories had plaque.

“Then we looked more carefully,” Dr. Skovronsky said. “The 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group.”

What, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Were they starting to develop Alzheimer’s? If so, could dementia be stalled if there were drugs to stop amyloid from accumulating?

The definition of Alzheimer’s is plaque plus memory loss and other symptoms of mental decline. But what is not known because no one could follow the development of plaque before a person died, was whether people with plaque and normal memories were developing Alzheimer’s.

“We’ve always assumed the pathology has been there, that the plaque has been there years before symptoms,” said Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, an Alzheimer’s researcher who is vice president and dean at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. “But we never had a way to detect plaque in living persons,” he said. And so plaque in the brains of people with normal memories has been a puzzle.

“Over the next couple of years, we will find out what it means.”

A Request of the Dying

On Oct. 23, 2008, Avid and two other companies, Bayer and General Electric , that are developing fluorine 18-based dyes for amyloid scans, got a pointed question from an advisory committee to the F.D.A.: How do you know that what you are seeing on scans is the same as the amyloid you see on autopsy?

It seemed impossible to answer. If researchers wait for their subjects to die before comparing scans with autopsies they can be waiting a long time.

But Avid had a plan, and the committee agreed in principle that it would work. Hospice patients would be study subjects, some with dementia, some without. All would have memory tests and brain scans. After death, their brains would be autopsied. Avid suggested that after the first 35 died, there should be enough data to know if the scans gave a true picture of the pathology. Then the F.D.A. could decide if the results were convincing enough to approve the dye for marketing.

Some doctors had misgivings, wondering how they could ask people who were sick and dying to be scanned just to help Alzheimer’s research. But, they found, most patients and their families agreed and said they were grateful to have been asked.

That was evident on May 19, when Dr. Skovronsky gave a lunch for patients’ families in Sun City, Ariz., to thank them for participating.

They thanked him.

“It really touched my heart to be in this,” said Dorothy Wall, whose husband, Claude E. Wall, died of liver cancer in Sun City on March 3.

“Something bad happens, and now something good happens.”

Answers

Late last year, Avid saw the initial results of its hospice study — data from the first six patients. Then, as more patients were studied, the data from them were held by a company that would analyze it. Avid did not see the results until the study was completed. But those first six were encouraging.

A man diagnosed with Alzheimer’s and cancer had a scan showing no plaque. His autopsy did not show it, either. The diagnosis was wrong. Another man with Parkinson’s disease and dementia had been diagnosed as having dementia solely due to Parkinson’s. His scan showed amyloid. So did the autopsy. He had Alzheimer’s. A woman with mild memory loss had a scan showing no amyloid. Her autopsy also found none. Three others had clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer’s, confirmed by scans and autopsies.

Finally, on May 14, 35 patients had been scanned and autopsied. The Avid study was complete, and the full data will be presented at the meeting next month. Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine.

And Dr. Skovronsky got that e-mail message.

“This is going to have a big impact on Alzheimer’s disease, guys,” he told his staff that day.",1
"(CNN) -- Losing interest in sex would be unfortunate for most people, but for Linda Poelzl it was a professional hazard.

""I just wasn't feeling much interest in sex, and this was very disturbing to me,"" says Poelzl, who lives and works in San Francisco. ""I have to have a certain amount of interest in it because of my work.""

Poelzl's describes her work as a ""sex educator and coach,"" helping men, women, and couples work through their sexual problems. She says she usually possesses a great lust for lust, but then her libido started dissipating a few years ago when she was in her late 40s.

Shocked and not quite sure what to do, she turned to medical doctors, and found there wasn't much they could offer, as there's no prescription medicine like Viagra to help a woman when her sex life gets stuck. The greatest hope for a so-called ""female Viagra"" was a drug called flibanserin, but it was nixed by a panel of Food and Drug Administration experts on Friday, who said the drug didn't seem to really help women with sexual dysfunction.

This was the second time a so-called ""female Viagra"" failed to make it on the market; in 2004, an FDA panel said no to Intrinsa, a testosterone patch meant to hormonally help women with a lack of desire for sex.

Given these two rejections, it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems. One company, BioSante Pharmaceuticals, hopes to bring a testosterone gel to the market in 2012, but there aren't many other products on the horizon.

""There hasn't been much action in this area, and that certainly has to come up when a company is thinking about dumping money into researching a drug for female sexual dysfunction,"" says Phyllis Greenberger, president of the Society for Women's Health Research, which received money from Boehringer Ingelheim, the company that makes flibanserin.

That's despite a seeming need for such medication. In 2008, a survey of more than 30,000 U.S. women in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology found that nearly 40 percent reported that they'd had a sexual problem at some point in their lives, most often a lack of desire.

After seeing medical doctors but getting few results, Poelzl decided to take another route. She visited alternative practitioners and began experimenting with Taoist exercises used in Chinese medicine. She practiced six minutes of exercises every morning, such as sitting quietly in a chair massaging her lower abdomen.

While there's no hard science that shows that Taoist practices will improve a woman's sex life, Poelzl says it worked for her.

""I noticed I started feeling more energy in my body, and more libido,"" she says. ""But it took at least six weeks of almost daily practice. You have to be committed.""

In fact, for nearly all alternative practices there are no large-scale studies saying if they work or not. But in the absence of a drug to help women with sexual problems, here's what's recommended by some practitioners.

1. Acupuncture

Jill Blakeway, a licensed acupuncturist who practices in New York City, started out doing acupuncture to help women get pregnant. But then a few years later she started noticing something interesting.

""After having a couple of kids, patients were coming back to me and saying, 'I just never feel like it anymore,'"" Blakeway says.

She then developed a specialty in acupuncture to help women lift their flagging libidos. She says acupuncture, like Viagra, increases blood flow to the genitals, but unlike Viagra, it usually takes four to six weeks to see results.

""If your sexuality has been lying dormant for a while, then it's going to take a while to wake it up,"" Blakeway says. ""And when it does wake up, I tell women not to see this as goal-oriented orgasmic sex, but rather as a way of connecting to their partner.""

One of Blakeway's patients wrote an article for the magazine, Cookie, about her experience with acupuncture for her flagging sex life.

2. Chinese medicine

Blakeway says she often has success combining acupuncture with Chinese medicine. To find a practitioner familiar with Chinese medicine, go to the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine

Blakeway says between acupuncture and Chinese medicine, she's able to help about 65 percent of the women who come to her with sexual problems.

3. Maca

A root vegetable grown in high elevations in the mountains of Peru, animal studies have shown that maca increases sex drive. It's widely marketed in Peru as an aphrodisiac, where it's sold in several forms, including capsules and powdered form.

Researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital are studying maca in women with sexual dysfunction.

Here's more information on the sexual effects of maca from New York University Langone Medical Center.

4. Ginkgo biloba

Researchers at the University of California, San Francisco, found that the herb ginkgo biloba was useful in helping women who had sexual dysfunction brought on by antidepressants.

Here's more information on ginkgo, including its sexual effects, from the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine at the National Institutes of Health.

5. Herbal combinations

Dr. Craig Koniver, a Charleston, South Carolina, family physician who specializes in alternative medicine, says he has success treating women with sexual dysfunction with herbal combinations. Several companies, including one owned by Koniver, make herbal combinations.

You can also visit a practitioner familiar with herbs to make a combination for you. You can find a practitioner through the National Certification Commission for Acupuncture and Oriental Medicine, or if you prefer a medical doctor, visit the website of the American College for Advancement in Medicine, where you can put in your ZIP code and find a doctor who specializes in integrative medicine.

Whatever you try to get your libido back, remember that your first attempt might not work.

""Different things for different women,"" Blakeley says. ""It's not a one-size-fits-all situation.""

"June 22, 2010 -- Drinking lots of coffee probably isn't entirely good for you, but it does lower your risk of mouth and throat cancer.

That's probably not what University of Milan researchers Carlotta Galeone, ScD, PhD, and colleagues thought they'd find when they analyzed nine studies comparing 5,139 people with head and neck cancer to 9,028 people without cancer.

But the numbers came out this way: People who drink more than four cups of coffee each day have 39% lower odds of getting mouth or throat cancer, compared to people who don't drink coffee. The protection was seen for oral and pharyngeal cancer, but not for cancer of the larynx.

Drinking less than five cups of coffee a day had a smaller but statistically significant protective effect: about 4% lower odds of mouth and throat cancer for each cup drunk daily.

Was it the caffeine? Probably not. Though there weren't enough data on decaf drinkers to draw conclusions, drinking tea -- even massive quantities -- was not protective.

Galeone and colleagues note that coffee contains more than a thousand chemicals. Some, such as cafestol and kahweol, have anti-cancer properties. But whether these substances actually protect against cancer in humans is a question for future studies.

Most head and neck cancers are linked to alcohol consumption and to smoking. Interestingly, the protective effect of coffee was not diminished in drinkers and smokers. Nor was the effect boosted by consumption of fruits and vegetables, also shown to protect against head and neck cancers.

Galeone and colleagues report their findings in the July issue of Cancer Epidemiology, Biomarkers, & Prevention.",0
"They are part of a new wave of smart implantable devices that is transforming the care of people with heart disease and creating a bonanza for researchers. The hope is that the devices, now being tested in clinical trials, will save lives, reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs. Patients, who often are frail or live far from their doctors, can be spared frequent office visits. Doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients’ hearts are starting to fail.

“It’s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week,” said Dr. Leslie Saxon, a cardiologist at the University of Southern California.

The big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range, 20 or 30 feet. That meant that, with her device, Mrs. Elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest. Instead, she simply went near a small box, which is attached to a phone jack near her bed. Once a week, she also measures her weight and blood pressure — key indicators of heart failure — and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor. If there are problems, the machine alerts her doctor.

“Now, every single day the device is being queried,” said her doctor, James Coman of the Heart Rhythm Institute in Tulsa. “It’s just a phenomenal tool.”

There is a downside, though: “Information overload is a very serious problem” for the doctors, said Dr. Lynne Warner Stevenson, director of the Heart Failure Program at Brigham and Women’s Hospital in Boston and a professor at Harvard Medical School, who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices. More information, she warned, is not always beneficial.

The devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear, like variations in heart rate. Large swings in heart rate can indicate risk, but it is not clear what to do about them.

Even more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance, a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung. Impedance changes can predict future heart crises, but more often have no clinical explanation. Yet when doctors get data on impedance changes, they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are, making patients uneasy in turn, Dr. Stevenson said.

Dr. Stevenson likened such information to the game of “Jeopardy!” — doctors are given answers in search of a question. It’s a challenge even for the nation’s 1,000 heart failure specialists. But it can be even harder for primary care doctors, who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition.

Dr. Richard Page, president of the Heart Rhythm Society, said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data. Still, he said, the new technology “is potentially transformative.”

For researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem: how to analyze the data. A large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve 1,000, maybe 2,000 patients. Now, Boston Scientific, a maker of one of the smart heart devices, is following 400,000 patients.

“No one has ever done research like this before,” said Dr. Saxon, who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing Boston Scientific research. The company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write, Dr. Saxon said.

Boston Scientific gets data from patients’ defibrillators. It also gets information on deaths from Medicare.

The data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed, a task requiring the company to become more like a Google or a Microsoft, handling enormous amounts of information. There are, for example, more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over 60,000 instances when the defibrillators went off, shocking a patient’s heart.

So far, Dr. Saxon’s group has reported on the first 90,000 patients. Half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group.

Patients whose doctors looked at the data survived 5 to 15 percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices, Dr. Saxon reported. And, in a paper under review, the group reports that their three-year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data.

Other researchers will be analyzing economic data. The devices can cost as much as $30,000. Do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits?

A study using a similar device, made by Medtronic, suggests that is the case. The Medtronic study, directed by Dr. George Crossley, president of St Thomas Heart at Baptist Hospital in Nashville, involved 2,000 patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit. Those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor’s offices every few months, the standard of care.

Patients whose devices transmitted spent less time, on average, in the hospital when they were admitted — 3.3 days compared with 4 days — and their hospital costs were $1,600 less per admission.

“The plausible reason, we think, is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness,” Dr. Crossley said. “We think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure.”

Still, the information overload problem looms. One solution, being tested by St. Jude Medical, a medical device company in St. Paul, is to let patients deal with important data.

The idea, said Dr. Neal Eigler, a senior vice president at St. Jude, is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart’s functioning, just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings.

Patients hold a small device over their chest twice a day, and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath. It transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium — the upper left chamber of the heart. If pressure in that chamber gets too high, the lungs can fill with fluid.

Doctors preprogram the hand-held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements, telling them, for example, to take a different dose of a medication, restrict fluid intake, increase their activity level or call the clinic.

If successful, the smart device could have a big effect. One million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure. Ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs.

Dr. Stevenson, who has no connection with St. Jude, is intrigued. Patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly. They have to strictly limit salt in their diet, for example, and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating.

“A patient might say, ‘Maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza I had for dinner last night had a lot of salt,’ ” Dr. Stevenson said.

As a more positive incentive, the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well.

St. Jude recently completed a small study of 40 patients and is starting a large clinical trial. In the pilot study, the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two-thirds and the number of hospitalizations by 80 percent over five months.

Meanwhile, patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind.

They include people like Danielle Denlein, who, to her total shock, developed a serious heart problem.On October 20, 2008, at 1:50 p.m., Ms. Denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her 5-day-old baby girl. Suddenly, she felt a pain in her chest. She thought it was heartburn. Then it began radiating down her arm.

“I just knew — I don’t know how I knew, but I knew — I was having a heart attack,” she said.

Although she was only 35, her main coronary artery had ripped open, a rare complication associated with pregnancy.

Ms. Denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart, and to alert her doctor, Dr. Saxon, to problems if they occur.

“It’s life changing,” Ms. Denlein said. “It gives me such a feeling of comfort.”

Mrs. Elzo feels the same way.

Had her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced, she said, “I shudder to think what would have happened.”",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An experimental drug being developed to fight influenza may fight a common but little-known virus called parainfluenza virus, researchers and the company said on Friday.

Tests in rats showed Fludase, made by privately held NexBio, could stop parainfluenza viruses from replicating, the researchers reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases.

Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug, also known as DAS181, in lab dishes and on cotton rats, a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza.

“Therapies for parainfluenza are urgently needed,” Moscona, an expert on parainfluenza viruses, said in a statement.

“Development of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines for human parainfluenza virus has lagged far behind influenza, despite the recognized impact of these diseases in children” and adults, “particularly the elderly, immunocompromised and patients with underlying airway disease.”

Parainfluenza viruses are not closely related to flu but belong to another family of viruses called paramyxoviruses. They cause most cases of croup and can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis — an inflammation of the small air passages in the lungs.

There is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza.

Fludase is already in phase 2 clinical trials for use against influenza. Adding parainfluenza to its approved indications would provide a unique and potentially large market for San Diego-based NexBio.

Parainfluenza uses the same receptors — molecular doorways — to infect cells as flu does. Fludase inactivates these receptors.

The researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza.

There were some weaknesses in the study. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza. And infection in rats does not follow the same disease course as in humans.

Moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals.

A spokesman for NexBio, David Wurtman, said the company would seek Food and Drug Administration approval to test Fludase in people with parainfluenza.

Because Fludase affects the human cells that viruses infect, not the virus itself, it is less likely to cause the virus to develop resistance, the company believes.

Influenza viruses have already developed widespread resistance to three commonly used flu drugs — amantadine, rimantadine and Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc’s Tamiflu.

A fourth drug, GlaxoSmithKline’s and Biota Inc’s Relenza, works by the same mechanism as Tamiflu.",1
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A new, longer-lasting “morning-after” pill to prevent unwanted pregnancy appears to work with no unexpected side effects, U.S. health regulatory staff said in documents released on Tuesday.

Data shows the one-pill treatment, called ella and made by French drugmaker HRA Pharma, is effective when taken as many as five days after unprotected sex, Food and Drug Administration staff reviewers said in documents released ahead of a public meeting on the drug scheduled for Thursday.

At the meeting, an FDA panel of outside experts will decide whether to recommend the agency approve the emergency contraceptive for the U.S. market. If approved, Watson Pharmaceuticals Inc would sell the drug in the United States.

HRA Pharma’s drug, approved last year in Europe under the name ellaOne, has re-ignited debate over “morning-after” pills in the United States, where reproductive issues are a constant political issue.

Women’s health advocates have welcomed the potential for another contraceptive option, but some critics contend the drug is more akin to the abortion pill, sold by Danco Laboratories as Mifeprex and also known as RU-486 or mifepristone.

Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd sells a rival product, called Plan B, a two-pill regimen with generic competition from Watson’s Next Choice. Teva also sells a one-pill version of Plan B.

Both versions of Plan B, which are available over the counter for women at least 17 years of age, have only been proven to work for up to 72 hours after intercourse.

“There is a medical need for an efficient emergency contraceptive product which acts consistently over a prolonged time period,” HRA Pharma said in a separate document released by the FDA.

The drugmaker has said its pill, also known by its chemical name ulipristal, works primarily by preventing ovulation of a woman’s egg. But the drug’s effect on the lining of the uterus — critical for a fertilized egg to develop — may also play a role, according to its label in Europe.

FDA staff scientists, in their review, concurred.

The agency’s reviewers also said the company’s studies showed no unexpected side effects in women, although reports of nausea, headache and abdominal pain were common. It was not clear what effect the drug had, if any, when a woman still became pregnant despite taking it, they added.

“Data on pregnancy outcomes after EC (emergency contraceptive) failure with ulipristal were too limited to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the effect of ulipristal on an established pregnancy or fetal development,” they wrote.

“MORE LEEWAY”

Emergency contraceptive pills have been available in the United States for more than a decade.

Plan B, or levonorgestrel, was first approved in 1999. Efforts in 2001 to make it available without a prescription stirred fierce opposition from conservatives, and the bid stalled under the George W. Bush administration. Democrats angered by the delay threatened to block Bush’s nominee to run the FDA. Easier access to the drug won approval in 2006.

HRA is not seeking to sell ella without a doctor’s prescription.

Advocates for women’s health have applauded the possibility of additional contraceptive options, saying a longer-lasting product could help women who want to avoid pregnancy.

For ella, “while you’re going to have to go and get a prescription for it, it gives you a little bit more leeway in terms of putting your ability to put your life on hold and get this healthcare need taken care of,” said Amy Allina, program and policy director for the National Women’s Health Network.

Cost is also an issue. With Plan B sold over the counter, most women have to pay for the drug themselves — roughly $50 — rather than have their health insurance cover it, Allina said.

Anti-abortion groups oppose HRA Pharma’s drug, saying it is closer chemically to mifepristone than Plan B and pressing the FDA to reject the product.

Like mifepristone, ella is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator (SPRM) that interferes with the hormone progesterone, which is critical for pregnancy.

If it is approved, it should be clearly labeled as an abortifacient, which would limit its distribution, the American Association of Pro Life Obstetricians & Gynecologists said in a letter to the FDA earlier this month.

“There is no doubt that ulipristal acts an abortifacient because the drug blocks progesterone receptors at three critical areas,” an action that “interferes with the hormone action of progesterone to prepare the endometrium for implantation and to support the early pregnancy,” the group wrote.

Proponents agree that ella is similar chemically to mifepristone but say the dose given does not interfere with a pregnancy already underway.

“There’s just no evidence that it causes abortion,” said Baylor College of Medicine professor Paul Fine, who also serves as medical director for Planned Parenthood in Houston and Southeast Texas.

On Thursday, the FDA’s advisers will weigh HRA Pharma’s data and offer recommendations before the agency later makes its approval decision.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Robots may not help doctors do a better job on some surgeries, according to a new study.

Surgeons treating women with endometriosis - a chronic condition that affects more than 5 million women and adolescent girls in the U.S. - didn’t get better or faster results when they used a robotic system.

With the surgeon alone, “the incision is smaller (and) the manipulations are more controlled,” Dr. Ceana Nezhat, an author on the study and the chair of Obstetrics & Gynecology at Northside Hospital in Atlanta, told Reuters Health.

Because the robot lets the surgeon get a better picture of the inside of the body, the authors had expected that surgeries using the robot would go more smoothly than those without it.

To test this idea, they looked back at 78 minor surgeries that were done on women with endometriosis - half using the assistance of a robot, half without it.

There was no difference in how much blood patients lost, and there were no complications in either group. But robotic surgeries took longer than non-robotic surgeries by about 40 minutes - 3 hours and 11 minutes compared to 2 hours and 29 minutes, on average. Longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong.

The robot-surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one.

Surgical robots do not operate on their own. Rather, surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body, while they watch a three-dimensional image of what’s going on inside. One robot can cost around $1.5 million.

“We were surprised that (surgery with the robot) did not have better outcomes than (the surgeon alone), as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better,” the authors write.

However, they suggest that more complicated procedures for severe endometriosis, which might require open surgery, would benefit from the help of a robot.

Inexperienced doctors might also take advantage of the robot for surgery if they don’t think they have the skills to do the surgery with only a small cut, Dr. Nezhat said. In this case, the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one.

Dr. Tommaso Falcone, chair of obstetrics and gynecology at Cleveland Clinic, said this study shows that more technology is not always better. Using a robot for basic surgery, like the kind studied here, would be like using a computer to do addition, he told Reuters Health.

“I just need a calculator to add a few things,” said Falcone, who was not involved in the study. “Yes it’s true that if I’ve got that supercomputer maybe it looks better. But all I need to do is add 5 and 5.”

Especially in a time of concern over rising medical costs, “we should not simply use the highly sophisticated technology just because it’s there,” Falcone said.

"Francesco Tonelli for The New York Times

Next time you order takeout wonton soup and a spicy Number 82, you might want to make sure it comes with brown rice.

Brown rice is a whole grain — white rice before it has been refined and polished and stripped of the bran covering, which is high in fiber and nutrients. Brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice, which means it doesn’t cause blood glucose levels to rise as rapidly.

Now a new study from researchers at Harvard reports that Americans who eat two or more servings of brown rice a week reduce their risk of developing Type 2 diabetes by about 10 percent compared to people who eat it less than once a month. And those who eat white rice on a regular basis — five or more times a week — are almost 20 percent more likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than those who eat it less than once a month.

Just replacing a third of a serving of white rice with brown each day could reduce one’s risk of Type 2 diabetes by 16 percent, a statistical analysis showed. A serving is half a cup of cooked rice.

The study, which was published in The Archives of Internal Medicine and used data from two Harvard nurses’ health studies and a separate study of health professionals, isn’t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in Type 2 diabetes. A 2007 study of Chinese women in Shanghai found that middle-aged women who ate large amounts of white rice and other refined carbohydrates were also at increased risk for diabetes compared to their peers who ate less.

But the Harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the United States, where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall, said Dr. Qi Sun, an instructor in medicine at Brigham and Women’s Hospital, which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School. Many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together.

“The bottom line is we showed evidence that increased consumption of white rice – even at this low level of intake — is still associated with increased risk,” said Dr. Sun, who was at the Harvard School of Public Health when the study was done. “It’s really recommended to replace white rice with the same amount of brown rice or other whole grains.”

The researchers who did the study analyzed rice consumption among 39,765 men and 57,463 women who participated in the Health Professionals Follow-up Study and the Nurses’ Health Study I and II; participants in the three groups ranged in age from 26 to 87.

They had filled out food frequency questionnaires when the studies started — in 1986, 1984 and 1991, respectively — and updated their diet information every four years subsequently, through 2005 and 2006. They were also asked about their medical histories. During the course of the studies, more than 10,000 participants developed Type 2 diabetes.

Such food studies can be unreliable, since they rely on self-reported surveys. And correlation does not necessarily mean a cause-and-effect relationship, since factors other than brown rice consumption may have accounted for the decreased diabetes risk that was observed. The researchers tried to control for the fact that Americans who eat brown rice tend to be more healthy overall — they eat more fruits and vegetables and less red meat and trans fats, and they also tend to be thinner, more active and less likely to smoke than those who don’t eat brown rice.

But, Dr. Sun said, there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for Type 2 diabetes. In addition to having a lower glycemic index than white rice, brown rice also contains important nutrients like magnesium that are stripped during the refining process; it also contains much more fiber. Earlier studies have found that having these nutrients in the diet protects against diabetes, Dr. Sun said.

Correction: An earlier version of this story misidentified the amount of cooked rice in a serving. A serving is one-quarter cup of uncooked rice, or about half a cup when cooked.",1
"NEW YORK (Reuters) - An insomnia drug being developed by Merck & Co was significantly better at improving sleep than a placebo in a mid-stage study, according to data presented on Wednesday.

The drug, MK-4305, helped patients sleep for a larger percentage of eight hours spent in bed at one night and at the end of four weeks of treatment, Merck said.

The drug also demonstrated superiority to placebo in the time it took to fall asleep and time spent awake after initially falling asleep, Merck said.

MK-4305 belongs to a new class of sleep drugs that inhibits production of orexins in the brain, blocking stimulation of the brain’s arousal system. Orexin is a neuropeptide that is believed to play a key role in regulation of the brain’s sleep/wake process.

The 254-patient study tested MK-4305 at 10 milligrams, 20 mg, 40 mg, and 80 mg against a placebo. The findings were presented at Associated Professional Sleep Societies meeting in San Antonio, Texas.

In the one-night measure, patients who took the highest dose of the Merck drug slept 12.2 percent more of the eight hours than those who got a placebo. The improvement was 11.6 percent at 40 mg, 6.6 percent at 20 mg and 6.2 percent at the lowest dose.

After four weeks, when there tends to be some improvement in the placebo patients, 80 mg patients slept 7.7 percent more, while those who got the 40 mg dose slept 7.9 percent more. At 20 mg the difference was 10.4 percent and at 10 mg, 4.7 percent.

Merck said it has begun separate larger Phase III studies of MK-4305 in elderly and non-elderly insomnia patients and expects to seek approval of the drug in 2012.

The company said it is testing only the 40 mg and 20 mg doses in the Phase III study among younger patients and 30 mg and 15 mg doses in the late stage trial of elderly patients.

“Forty milligrams looked like best dose on efficacy and tolerability,” said David Michelson, Merck’s vice president for neuroscience clinical research. He said the 80 mg dose was likely more than most people need.

People with insomnia may have one or more sleep problems, including difficulty falling asleep, trouble staying asleep and difficulty getting back to sleep after waking in the night.

Patients who took the 40 mg dose in the trial spent 33 fewer minutes awake after falling asleep than the placebo group at one night and averaged 32 fewer minutes awake at the end of week four.

On average, it took patients 21.6 fewer minutes to fall asleep with the 40 mg dose of MK-4305 than a placebo on night one, Merck said.

There were no reports of serious adverse side effects. The most common side effects included upper respiratory tract infection, urinary tract infection, dizziness, drowsiness on waking, headache and vivid dreams.

“We are encouraged by these Phase II results showing positive effects of MK-4305 in patients with primary insomnia,” Michelson said in a statement.",0
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A urine test can help doctors better spot prostate cancer than either the current blood test or a rectal exam alone, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.

They said Gen-Probe’s Progensa PCA3 test caught about half the actual cases of prostate cancer in men who had abnormal PSA levels or digital rectal exams, and had about a 20 percent “false positive” rate.

“That’s pretty good, actually,” said Dr. David Crawford of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who helped lead the study.

Trying to diagnose prostate cancer is one of the most maddening tasks a doctor has. The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to.

Digital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate — or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection.

Biopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely.

And prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them.

The Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer.

Lightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test.

Crawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies.

“It reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,” Crawford said. “If you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55.”

The test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did. This compares to just 21 percent for PSA alone, the researchers told a meeting of the American Urological Association in San Francisco.

“If the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,” Crawford said.

The test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation.

Among the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer.

The test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.",1

"PARIS (Reuters) - Sanofi-Aventis’ cabazitaxel candidate prostate cancer drug combined with prednisone reduced the risk of death by 28 percent compared with another treatment, the outcome of a final-stage trial showed.

The French drugmaker said on Thursday that the combination of the treatments led to an improved median overall survival of 15.1 months against 12.7 months in patients who took a chemotherapy of mitoxantrone with prednisone/prednisolone.

The primary endpoint of the so-called Tropic trial was overall survival.

Cabazitaxel won priority review from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), meaning the health regulator will take about six months instead of the usual 10 months to assess if a drug is efficient and safe to be marketed.

The FDA’s review should happen in the third quarter, Sanofi said.

Filing for approval in the EU has been completed.

Some 4.9 percent of patients using cabazitaxel died from side-effects. Sanofi said this was mainly due to neutropenia, a blood disorder people can get from chemotherapy treatment, and its complications.

This compared with 1.9 percent using mitoxantrone.

“The development of cabazitaxel is one of many investigational compounds we hope to present to the cancer community in the months and years to come,” Debasish Roychowdhury, Sanofi’s oncology senior vice president, said.

The clinical trial results will be presented at the 2010 American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) on June 6.",1
"THURSDAY, May 27, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A new approach to treating irregular heartbeats appears to have demonstrated success in halting abnormal electrical pulses in both patients and pigs, new research indicates.

In essence, the new intervention -- known as ""visually guided laser-balloon catheter"" -- enables doctors to much more accurately target the so-called ""misfiring cells"" that emit the irregular electrical impulses that can cause an erratic heartbeat.

In fact, with this new approach, the study team found that physicians could destroy such cells with 100 percent accuracy. This, they said, is due to the procedure's use of a slender medical device called an endoscope, which when inserted into the target region provides a continuous real-time image of the culprit cells.

The traditional means for getting at misfiring cells relies on pre-intervention X-rays for a much less precise snapshot form of visual guidance.

The findings are reported by study author Dr. Vivek Y. Reddy, a senior faculty member in medicine and cardiology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York City, and colleagues in the May 26 online edition of Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology.

About 2.2 million Americans currently live with an irregular heartbeat condition, known as atrial fibrillation. Among individuals over the age of 65, it is the most common ""serious"" form of heart rhythm irregularities, according to background information in a news release from the American Heart Association.

Atrial fibrillation accounts for between 15 percent and 20 percent of all ischemic strokes, with stroke risk rising fivefold among patients with the condition as compared to healthy men and women, the release noted.

The current study focused on 27 patients (66 percent men), all of whom were diagnosed with a form of atrial fibrillation. All had already undergone at least one failed drug regimen.

Reddy's team used the new procedure to successfully blast all the targeted misfiring cells in each patient's pulmonary veins, which transport blood from the lungs to the heart.

The investigators found that after just one laser treatment, misfiring ceased in 84 percent of the treated veins, and 90 percent remained inactive three months after treatment.

The researchers achieved similar results in work with pigs, whose heart closely resembles the structure of the human heart.

TUESDAY, May 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) --Giving certain breast cancer patients estrogen-lowering drugs before surgery enhances their chances of being able to choose a breast-conserving lumpectomy instead of a full mastectomy, new research suggests.

The observation was based on a national study launched at 118 hospitals across the United States. It focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that was either at stage II or stage III -- that is, tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm.

The most common form of breast cancer, ER+ accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases in the United States, the authors noted.

The 352 women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a 16-week regimen of aromatase inhibitors -- estrogen-lowering agents -- before any surgery. Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors.

The women were classified into three groups as the study began: ""marginal"", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; ""mastectomy-only"", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and ""inoperable"", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer.

After the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery.

More than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome. And 75 percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast-conservation surgery.

The investigation was funded by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and led by Dr. Julie A. Margenthaler, an assistant professor of surgery and a breast surgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis.

""Aromatase inhibitor therapy shrank the tumors in many of these women and improved surgical outcomes,"" study chair Dr. Matthey J. Ellis, a breast cancer specialist at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, said in a news release. ""These results will encourage a change in practice across the country so that more women can benefit from the currently underutilized approach of administering estrogen-lowering agents before surgery.""

The findings are scheduled to be presented June 7 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, in Chicago.

"“These data support the vision that we have long had for fundamentally changing the treatment for hepatitis C,” Dr. Robert Kauffman, Vertex’s chief medical officer, said in a conference call with securities analysts.

The results also keep Vertex at the front of a crowded field that has made hepatitis C one of the fiercest battlegrounds in the pharmaceutical business. Merck is expected to announce late-stage trial results of a similar drug, boceprevir, this year. And numerous other companies, from pharmaceutical giants to small start-ups, are in hot pursuit.

Both Vertex’s telaprevir and Merck’s boceprevir block an enzyme known as protease that is made by the virus. Most of the other new drugs also work by blocking viral enzymes. This direct antiviral approach has been used with great success in treating H.I.V. and AIDS.

Vertex itself says it expects results from two additional Phase 3 trials of telaprevir in the third quarter and will then apply to the Food and Drug Administration for approval of the drug.

Some 2.7 million to 3.9 million Americans are estimated to have hepatitis C, and 12,000 die from it each year, according to a recent report by the Institute of Medicine.

The disease can cause cirrhosis, which is a scarring of the liver, as well as liver cancer. The virus is transmitted by blood, so most people who have hepatitis C either have injected illegal drugs or received blood transfusions or blood products before the early 1990s.

The existing treatment is a combination of alpha interferon, which is injected, and ribavirin, an oral drug. It is not quite clear how those drugs work.

For patients with the type of hepatitis most prevalent in the United States, which is called Genotype 1, the treatment lasts nearly a year and can cause side effects that include flulike symptoms, anemia and depression. It is so arduous that many patients opt not to get treated or drop out before completing the course.

But in Vertex’s trial, about 70 percent of those who achieved an effective cure were able to do so in 24 weeks, or about six months. That shorter time line, plus a higher chance of success, could entice more people to be treated, experts say.

“If you can promise them six months with a reasonable chance of a cure, that’s a meaningful advance,” said Dr. Scott L. Friedman, chief of the division of liver diseases at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York.

If approved, telaprevir would have to be used initially with the existing drugs to prevent the virus from evolving resistance. But experts hope that eventually several of the pills now in development could be used together, much as AIDS is treated, doing away with the need for interferon.

Vertex’s clinical trial enrolled 1,095 patients in the United States and abroad who had Genotype 1 hepatitis C and had not been treated previously. Patients got either 12 weeks or eight weeks of telaprevir or a placebo. The standard therapy of interferon and ribavirin was given for either 24 weeks or 48 weeks, depending on how the patients were faring after four weeks and 12 weeks.

Of those who got 12 weeks of telaprevir, 75 percent had a sustained viral response, meaning the virus was not detectable in their blood 24 weeks after completing treatment. That is seen as essentially a cure. The rate was 69 percent for those who got eight weeks of telaprevir.

The drug can cause a nasty rash and increases the rate of anemia. About 7 percent of the patients getting telaprevir dropped out of the trial, about double the figure for the control group.

Lorren Sandt, chairwoman of the National Viral Hepatitis Roundtable, an advocacy group, called the trial results impressive. But she added, “The community hopes that if telaprevir is approved by the F.D.A. that it will be accessible and affordable to everyone.”

Vertex, which is based in Cambridge, Mass., has not said what it would charge. But analysts expect the drug to cost tens of thousands of dollars for a course of treatment.",1
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An experimental cancer drug showed early promise at helping patients with advanced melanoma that had spread to the brain, according to a summary of data from a mid-stage study.

Bristol-Myers Squibb’s closely watched biotechnology drug ipilimumab, which enlists the help of the immune system to attack tumors, was found generally safe and showed signs that it was working on tumors in the brain, which are especially difficult to treat.

The study is the first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain, and the findings, released in an abstract or brief summary, support its potential use in these patients, the researchers said.

The abstract was one of thousands of studies released on Thursday ahead of presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) next month in Chicago.

Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody, an engineered human immune system protein that boosts the body’s immune response by interfering with another immune compound called CTLA-4, which acts as a sort of brake on immune system cells.

By temporarily removing this brake, the hope is to unleash the immune system to find and destroy the cancer.

Results of a late-stage study of the drug in melanoma patients will be detailed in a “late-breaker” session at ASCO’s annual meeting in June.

In the phase 2 trial, researchers said four out of 51 patients with at least one brain lesion had a partial response to the drug, and in 5 out of 51 patients, both brain and other tumors in the body stabilized after 12 weeks of treatment.

The responses lasted from three to 12 months, and patients had no serious toxic side effects. Data from a second arm of the study is still being evaluated.

A separate study of the drug also showed signs it could work in people who first appeared not to respond to the drug.

Researchers reintroduced the drug to 32 patients who were initially treated as part of a study of 634 patients.

Eight of the 32 got ipilimumab alone, 23 got ipilimumab plus a vaccine called gp100, and one got the vaccine alone. All of the treatments appeared safe.

The team found that in patients whose cancer initially progressed while on ipilimumab, whose who were reintroduced to the drug had a disease control rate of 65 to 75 percent, compared to zero in the patient who got the vaccine only.

“These findings may have implications for the use of ipilimumab therapy in the long-term management of advanced melanoma,” the researchers reported in the abstract.

Melanoma accounts for about 3 percent of skin cancer cases but causes most skin cancer deaths, and doctors have few effective treatments to offer once the disease has spread.

According to the American Cancer Society, melanoma accounted for more than 68,000 cases of skin cancer in 2009, and 8,650 deaths.",1

WEDNESDAY, May 19, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers hope that a simple brain scan performed in infants and toddlers can presage the development of autism, leading to early detection and early intervention.

The test involved using functional MRI to measure brain responses to spoken words in sleeping children.

""We're focusing on this earliest time period, when the brain is still developing and still changing,"" explained study author Lisa Eyler, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego. ""If we could use this with other markers, we could probably identify people early on and, if we could do that, we'd have a much better chance of helping to make sure that their language development is normal.""

The finding is slated to be presented Wednesday at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Philadelphia.

But another expert pointed out that the study is still extremely preliminary.

""It's a very early study. They have a long way to go before they're actually able to implement a test like this,"" said Keith Young, vice chairman of research in psychiatry and behavioral science at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in Temple.

Before bringing it to clinics, researchers need to make sure this test isn't detecting other developmental delays such as dyslexia, he noted.

""I wouldn't want to be telling people your kid has autism when the problem is that they're dyslexic,"" Young said.

And when it is ready for prime time, it probably won't be applicable to all children with autism.

""This is probably not going to be used for wide-scale screening but it could be used for children who we have some sense that they have autism and want to gather more information,"" said David Amaral, president of the International Society for Autism Research and research director of the University of California Davis MIND Institute. ""There are many, many different types of autism. There are some children with autism who don't have these specific abnormalities in brain function.""

Right now, experts have little to go by in detecting autism other than carefully monitoring the regular developmental milestones in children, Young said.

""We do need something,"" he said.

""One of the hallmark features of autism is deficits in language acquisition,"" Eyler explained. ""Whereas the typical developing kid will have an explosion of their language ability starting at about 12 months in both comprehension and production, kids in autism delay don't start comprehending or producing until later, and they don't ever have that kind of explosion. About 50 percent of kids with autism never develop language,"" she noted.

""We were interested in what was going on in the earliest period of life that could account for these differences,"" she continued.

For this study, Eyler and her colleagues monitored the brain activity of 30 children with an autism spectrum disorder (aged 14 months to 46 months) and 14 ""typical"" children of roughly the same age.

Children slept in the MRI machine while researchers read them bedtime stories. This allowed the investigators to see which parts of the brain were being activated in typical children versus children with autism.

""We were looking for areas of the brain that are more responsive during listening to bedtime stories than when they're not hearing that,"" Eyler said.

In the typically developing children, both sides of the brain involved in language processing were activated. In the youngest children, the activation was about equal in both the right and left hemisphere, while in the older children, activity became more pronounced on the left side, which is similar to adult patterns and to be expected, Eyler explained.

But in the autistic children, there was slightly more right hemisphere response than left hemisphere, and there was no change in activity across the age range.

""We didn't see that growth of the left hemisphere [in the children with autism],"" Eyler said.

""We now feel pretty confident that, in many children with autism, there are alterations either in structure growth or connectivity of the brain, but we really don't understand the implications of that for core features of autism, one of which is problems with communication,"" Amaral said. ""This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain.""

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A drug approved to treat a range of conditions may also work to prevent lung cancer in people who have given up smoking, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday.

The drug, called iloprost, is approved in inhaled forms to treat pulmonary hypertension, when blood pools near the lungs, a connective tissue disease called scleroderma and a nerve condition called Raynaud’s phenomenon.

Dr. Robert Keith of the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center and colleagues tested an oral version to see if it might prevent lung cancer in smokers and former smokers.

“Oral iloprost showed promise for preventing lung cancer in former, but not current, smokers in a phase II clinical trial,” they wrote in a summary presented to a meeting of the American Thoracic Society in New Orleans.

Iloprost is a version of prostacyclin, a drug in the prostaglandin class that prevents lung cancer in mice.

Keith, who has been testing several drugs to prevent lung cancer, looked at biopsies taken from the lungs of 125 current and former smokers.

They treated half with placebo and half with iloprost, and then performed bronchoscopy examinations to assess precancerous changes in the lungs.

Six months later, “former smokers showed significant improvements on all measures, indicating that treatment with iloprost may reduce the risk of developing lung cancer among former smokers,” the researchers said.

“Interestingly, current smokers did not show any significant improvements,” they added.

“Oral iloprost significantly improves endobronchial dysplasia in former smokers and deserves further study to determine if it can prevent the development of lung cancer.”

ITALIAN RESEARCH

Swiss drug maker Actelion markets inhaled iloprost under the brand name Ventavis.

It is also sold in an intravenous form under the trade name Ilomedin by Schering, acquired by Merck.

In April, researchers said a natural supplement derived from food, called myo-inositol, seems to stop the precancerous changes that lead to lung cancer.

Cigarette smoke causes 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer, which kills 1.2 million people a year globally. But only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes like heart disease, stroke or emphysema.

Separately, Italian researchers reported that advanced lung cancer patients given the targeted therapy drug Tarceva as so-called maintenance treatment — after they finished a course of standard chemotherapy — lived a little bit longer.

Federico Cappuzzo from Ospedale Civile di Livorno in Italy and colleagues did a phase 3 trial in 889 patients who had already had chemotherapy and whose tumors had not come back.

They received either Tarceva, a drug sold by Roche and OSI Pharmaceuticals and known generically as erlotinib, or a placebo until they got worse or died.

The patients who got Tarceva lived a little longer without their tumors growing — 12 weeks versus 11 weeks on average and they lived a month longer on average — 12 months versus 11 months.

This was seen even among patients who did not have the EGFR genetic mutation that Tarceva targets, they reported in Lancet Oncology.

Fewer than half of all lung cancer patients who do well after a first course of chemotherapy get more treatment, but the Italian group said their study shows this is worth doing.",1
"WEDNESDAY, May 12 (HealthDay News) -- A drug already approved for the treatment of erectile dysfunction may actually help boost the effectiveness of treatments for brain tumors tied to both lung and breast cancer, research shows.

The finding stems from an animal study that indicated that leading erectile dysfunction medications sildenafil (Viagra) and vardenafil (Levitra) can enable the chemotherapy drug Herceptin to more easily penetrate the so-called blood-brain barrier that must be breached in order to successfully target cancer that has spread to the brain.

Although the blood-brain barrier is a naturally occurring mechanism designed to protect the brain from exposure to dangerous substances, in the case of cancer treatment it can significantly impede drug delivery, particularly of large-molecule drugs, such as Herceptin. However, erectile dysfunction drugs appear to increase the barrier's permeability.

""No matter how effective against cancer a chemotherapeutic agent may be, it can have little impact on brain tumors if it cannot cross the blood-brain tumor barrier,"" Dr. Keith Black, chairman of Cedars-Sinai's department of neurosurgery and director of the Maxine Dunitz Neurosurgical Institute in Los Angeles, said in a news release. ""As we find new drugs that are able to target these tumor cells, it is imperative that we develop better ways to enable the medications to reach their targets.""

The study team notes that about 220,000 Americans develop brain tumors each year as a result of cancers that begin elsewhere in the body. Lung cancer, they note, is the leading cause of cancer mortality in the United States, and about one-fifth of lung cancer cases end up spreading to the brain.

Work with mice demonstrated that initial Levitra exposure effectively doubled the amount of Herceptin that was able to reach brain tumors linked to lung and breast cancer.

What's more, when administering Herceptin and Levitra together, survival among the mice increased by 20 percent compared to treatment with just Herceptin alone.

The findings were published online recently in the journal PLoS One.

"Varicose veins are a result of weak, stretched-out vein walls. Veins contain valves that, when stretched, no longer keep blood moving back toward the heart efficiently. Risk factors include genetics , age and standing still for prolonged periods.

Eighty-seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment, according to a 2008 survey of roughly 1,000 adults conducted nationwide by Vein Clinics of America and Opinion Research Corporation. But doctors say they should: these veins are not just a cosmetic problem, but can also lead to aches, pain, swelling and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs.

The treatment known as sclerotherapy — an alternative to surgery — entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls, so the vein eventually disappears. A series of sessions is usually required for a large area.

Vein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs. One, sodium tetradecyl sulfate, or STS, has long been F.D.A. approved. The other, polidocanol, had not been legal, although some doctors used it, importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds. “You have some legal exposure by doing so,” said Dr. Morrison, a vein specialist in greater Phoenix .

That said, polidocanol was the “second most commonly used sclerosing agent” because, he said, “most physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment.”

F.D.A. approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways. Often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were “wrong” and had “lots of contaminants” that could damage the skin where injected, according to Dr. Robert A. Weiss, a Baltimore dermatologist who directs the Maryland Laser, Skin and Vein Institute. By contrast, he said by e-mail, Asclera “is very safe for skin.”

An injector’s experience matters, because if the injection misses the vein, ulcers (or open sores) can occur. In these rare, worst-case scenarios, Asclera is relatively forgiving and less likely to lead to ulceration.

Vein specialists must first figure out which patients would benefit from sclerotherapy alone, and which need inner varicose veins treated before injections. Using ultrasound to map inner veins as well as visible ones is crucial for patients who complain of enlarged veins and symptoms like achy pain. “The underlying veins have to be addressed before you can even think of addressing the visible bulging veins,” said Dr. Robert J. Min, radiologist in chief at NewYork-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center . “Otherwise they’ll just come back.”

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Today, sluggish underlying veins are best addressed with radio-frequency or laser treatment, said Dr. Min, who developed such a laser. Yet, he said both are “very safe and effective, and a heck of a lot better than surgery.” (It entailed ripping out the groin-to-ankle vein with a wire via an incision.)

For Dianne Brought, who manages a clothing shop in Ocean City , Md., each time Dr. Weiss injected her with STS, she felt only “a little tiny pinch.” But she cautioned that if “anybody hates needles they will mind it.” Ms. Brought, 57, said her legs used to have “very nasty veins” and her calves hurt. She is still due for treatments, so some veins remain visible, but they are no longer raised. She now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop.

Some vein specialists use liquid irritants like STS or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins. Why? A “sudsy foam will fill up the vein, come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall, whereas liquid works for very small veins only,” said Dr. Nisha Bunke, a vein specialist. She said veins as large as a Sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy. But the F.D.A. considers a foam version of STS or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid. So injecting it is an off-label use.

Dr. Min said in an e-mail message that foam sclerotherapy was “very safe,” but that “it is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy.” Foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins, he wrote, adding that one known stroke “may have been caused by foam sclerotherapy.”

But foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients. Judson Emerick, an art history professor at Pomona College in Claremont, Calif., had varicose veins so troublesome that he kept getting skin ulcers that failed to heal. Plus, his “legs looked like a sack of walnuts,” he said.

After a series of injections with Dr. Bunke, his ulcers have subsided and he is thrilled. “My wife looked at me, and my veins had disappeared,” said Mr. Emerick, 68. “My calves and definition were visible again.”",1
"TUESDAY, May 4, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Noninvasive stool DNA testing can detect two types of colorectal precancers and could play a larger role in colon cancer prevention, say two new studies.

Compared with widely used fecal blood tests, stool DNA testing has higher detection rates for curable stage colorectal cancer and for common precancerous polyps (adenomas), according to the Mayo Clinic-led research teams.

The DNA stool test methods were developed at the Mayo Clinic. Some of the study authors and the Mayo Clinic have a financial interest related to technology used with this research.

The first study found that stool DNA testing detected five out of five cases of colon cancer and four out of five cases of a precancerous lesion called dysplasia in 10 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD).

""This study shows that cancer and precancer in IBD can be detected noninvasively,"" senior investigator Dr. David Ahlquist said in a Mayo news release. ""The 90 percent detection rate by stool DNA testing is remarkable. It's important for people with IBD because they are at much higher risk for colorectal cancer than the general population. Given the limitations of colonoscopies in detecting these lesions, stool DNA testing could play a complementary role to improve the effectiveness of cancer surveillance.""

In the second study, the researchers found that stool DNA testing had a success rate of 71 percent in detecting serrated colorectal polyps, compared to a 7 percent detection rate with fecal blood tests.

Serrated colorectal polyps, which are believed to be the forerunner in about 30 percent of colon cancer cases, can be difficult to detect using most types of colorectal cancer screening. Unlike common polyps, they tend to be flat and the same color as the colon lining.

The studies are slated to be presented on Monday and Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Gastroenterological Association.

""Detection of these important types of precancer by stool DNA testing offers promise in our efforts to more effectively and affordably prevent colorectal cancer. However, findings from both pilot studies need to be corroborated in larger studies,"" Ahlquist said.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A daily dose of electricity delivered to a specific part of the brain can lift depression, new research confirms, even for people who’ve already tried multiple antidepressants to no avail.

While there’s evidence that this technique, known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), helps depressed people get better-and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved TMS for this purpose-many skeptics have questioned whether it really works, notes Dr. Mark S. George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study.

The biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it’s tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which.

But George and his team say they’ve solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person’s eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device.

In the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks.

After three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment.

Based on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover.

Eighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching.

In a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression.

How long the treatment should last is not yet clear. “It’s very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,” George said. “It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up.”

Patients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that’s been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects.

TMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by “resetting” electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation.

Something similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as “electroshock treatment.” Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover.

George said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. “I’m optimistic that it’s pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.”

"SUNDAY, May 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- One reason many people dread a colonoscopy is the unpleasant preparation, which often requires that they drink a gallon of prescribed fluids to clear out their bowels before the procedure. But an industry-funded study suggests that a pill could negate the need for so much liquid.

Researchers from Henry Ford Hospital report that people preparing for the test were able to take a pill approved as a treatment for chronic constipation and avoid half of the liquid requirement.

In the study, 126 people took either the pill -- lubiprostone (Amitiza) -- or an inactive placebo. Those who took the combination of the pill and liquid were better able to tolerate the preparation than were those who drank a gallon of a mixture of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes, the study found.

""Most people say they don't want to have a colonoscopy because they find the preparation intolerable,"" the study's lead author, Dr. Chetan Pai, a gastroenterologist, said in a news release from the hospital. ""If physicians are able to offer a better way to prep, I think this will encourage more people to get the colonoscopies that may save their lives.""

Pai also pointed out that about 90 percent of colon cancer cases occur in people older than 50, an age group that tends to have an especially hard time drinking the gallon of liquid often prescribed for colonoscopy preparation.

The study, scheduled to be presented Sunday at the Digestive Diseases Week conference in New Orleans, was funded by the pill's manufacturer, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.

"If authenticated in further, larger trials, the results could also become a landmark in the field of autism research, since scientists speculated that the drug may help some patients with autism not caused by fragile X, perhaps becoming the first medicine to address autism’s core symptoms.

One child in five thousand is born with fragile X syndrome, with mental effects ranging from mild learning disabilities to retardation so profound that sufferers do not speak, and physical effects that include elongated faces, prominent jaws, big ears, and enlarged testes. It mostly affects boys and earned its name because, under a microscope, one arm of the X chromosome seems nearly broken, with part hanging by a thread.

The gene for fragile X was discovered in 1991. Work since then has found that fragile X patients seem to experience an overload of unchecked synaptic noise — synapses being the junctions between brain neurons. The Novartis drug and others like it are intended to lower the volume of this noise so memory formation and high-level thinking can take place, allowing children to develop normally.

The Novartis trial, which began in 2008 in Europe with data analysis completed this year, was too brief to observe effects on basic intelligence. Instead, researchers measured a range of aberrant behaviors like hyperactivity, repetitive motions, social withdrawal and inappropriate speech. They gave one set of patients the drug and another a placebo, and after a few weeks switched treatments, with both doctors and patients unaware of which pill was which.

The results of the trial were something of a jumble until Novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular, undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others. “The bottom line is that we showed clear improvements in behavior,” Dr. Fishman said.

Told of the results, two parents of a fragile X patient were euphoric.

“This is what we have been working for and hoping for since our son was diagnosed with fragile X 17 years ago,” said Katie Clapp, president and co-founder of the Fraxa Research Foundation, a nonprofit organization dedicated to financing fragile X research. “This may be the key to solving the mystery of autism and other developmental disorders.”

Geraldine Dawson, chief science officer at Autism Speaks, the world’s largest autism advocacy organization, said that a growing body of research suggests that the many genetic causes of autism all seem to affect synapses, suggesting that a treatment for one form of the disease might help others.

“The exciting thing about these results is that it is our hope that these same medications may have similar positive benefits for people with autism who don’t have fragile X syndrome,” Dr. Dawson said.

Between 10 percent and 15 percent of autism cases result from fragile X syndrome or some other known genetic defect. While fragile X is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation, Down syndrome — which also causes retardation — is more common but is not inherited.

The Novartis trial results were not published or peer reviewed, and for commercial reasons Dr. Fishman refused to divulge many details. Dr. Luca Santarelli, head of neuroscience at Roche, confirmed that Roche is in the midst of testing a similar medicine in fragile X patients at four sites in the United States.

“So far we like what we see,” Dr. Santarelli said in his only characterization of their study.

One reason for the euphoria surrounding the Novartis trial is that it was seen as an especially difficult test of the drug’s effects. For ethical reasons, Novartis tested the drug only in adults. But the company and outside researchers believe that such compounds may prove most effective in young children, whose brains are far more likely to respond rapidly when barriers to learning are removed.

“This is perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene-based behavioral disease,” said Dr. Edward M. Scolnick, former research chief at Merck and now director of the Stanley Center for Psychiatric Research at the Broad Institute at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Dr. Scolnick has not seen the results of the Novartis trial, but was told of them and concluded that if the drugs work in fragile X, “there’s nothing to say that they won’t work in some cases of broader autism-spectrum disorders.”

An Unlikely Beginning

The roots for the Novartis results began in 1982 when Stephen T. Warren, then a graduate student in genetics at Michigan State University, was looking for a job and something to research. A friend told him about fragile X and, with the same reflection he might use to pick a novel for a long flight, he decided that he wanted to find the gene that caused it.

“I had no idea how hard this would be,” Dr. Warren said. Nine years later, Dr. Warren, then at Emory University, was part of an international team that won a fierce competition by isolating the gene. The discovery was front-page news around the world, and experts predicted that widespread fetal testing and therapies were in the offing.

The predictions were premature because, like most of genetic research, discovering how the flawed gene caused disease was far harder than anticipated and required multiple leaps in neurology and biology. And even with those, much remains mysterious.

Advertisement Continue reading the main story

Fragile X is caused by a genetic stutter in which a portion of the gene gets repeated like a scratched album. With each subsequent generation, the number of repeats tends to rise. So if a mother has 10 repeats, her child might have 11 or 12. For reasons that are not well understood, however, this process of repeat amplification can suddenly go haywire. So mothers who have 55 or more repeats tend to have children with hundreds.

In anyone with 200 or more repeats, the body shuts off the gene. Since genes are used to make proteins, this genetic silencing means the encoded protein is never made. The absence of this protein in cells causes the wide-ranging effects of fragile X syndrome. Those with 55 to 200 repeats are considered carriers, and recent research shows they can have severe neurological declines late in life that mimic Alzheimer’s and Parkinson’s.

Many geneticists would have moved on to other research topics after finding a disorder’s underlying gene. But Dr. Warren met affected children and their parents. Instead of family pictures, Dr. Warren’s desk displays a framed photo of a fragile X chromosome.

“I could not imagine telling someone like Katie Clapp that we were not going to pursue this research anymore,” he said.

Photo

So he kept on. Years of work by him and others found that the protein missing in those with fragile X normally seems to act as a sort of traffic cop at brain synapses, helping to stop or slow brain signaling at crucial intervals. It does this by sopping up the genetic instructions needed to produce proteins that encourage brain signaling. Regulating this flow of electronic pulses across the brain is crucial for the brain’s ability to learn and mature.

Dr. Warren was puzzling over how to recreate that synaptic traffic cop when, because of a scheduling conflict, he showed up in 2001 at the wrong scientific conference and happened to sit next to Mark F. Bear, a neuroscience professor at M.I.T. who had just given a presentation about compounds that seemed to work in synapses to speed the creation of proteins — including the one missing in fragile X patients.

The two got to talking and decided to collaborate. They found that if Dr. Bear reverse-engineered his compounds, they seemed to slow brain transmissions. Instead of a traffic cop, the brain would get speed bumps. Not ideal, but perhaps adequate in lowering the synaptic noise enough to encourage learning and the moderation of the kind of synaptic traffic jams that in fragile X children can lead to seizures.

Sure enough, mice, fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile X seemed to become normal when given Dr. Bear’s compound. The Novartis compound is a member of the same drug family.

“We have been promising for a long time that unlocking the molecular basis for hereditary diseases would lead to dramatic therapeutic advances, and that promise is finally coming true,” said Dr. Francis S. Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, in discussing the science leading up to the trial. “But it has not been easy.”

A Search for Treatment

A hundred years ago, Katie Clapp would have died giving birth to Andy, her child with fragile X.

“Andy’s head was too big to get out without a C-section, he would have killed me, and that would have taken care of the fragile X gene,” she said.

But Ms. Clapp and Andy did survive. And despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country, four years would pass before Andy’s condition was properly diagnosed.

When a doctor finally thought to do a fragile X test, Ms. Clapp and her husband, Dr. Michael Tranfaglia — both Harvard graduates with post-graduate degrees — researched the disease and came to two conclusions: fragile X was potentially treatable; and only about five researchers in the world were working toward a cure.

“And I thought, what if all five walk across the street at the same time and get hit by a Mack truck?” Ms. Clapp said. “That is not going to get us there.”

So the two started the Fraxa Research Foundation. Remarkably, their efforts seem to be paying off and may finally offer hope not only to those who with fragile X but to carriers like Andy’s sister, Laura.

“I’ve always known my kids have a chance of having it,” Laura, 18, said in a recent visit to the family’s house. “But I’m not going to have kids for at least 10 years anyway, and they’ll have a cure for by then.”

She paused, looked at her mother and said: “You’ve got 10 years.”",1
"WEDNESDAY, April 28, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A new drug may be the first new treatment in 25 years for a common diabetes-linked eye condition called diabetic macular edema (DME), researchers report.

Lucentis (ranibizumab) was originally developed to treat age-related macular degeneration. But researchers say it can also improve vision in people with DME, a common form of diabetic retinopathy.

The study of 691 patients with DME found that 50 percent of those who received Lucentis eye injections, plus laser treatment if necessary, had substantial improvement in vision one year after treatment, compared with 28 percent of patients who received laser treatment alone. Results were similar after two years.

For 25 years, laser treatment has been the standard of care for DME, the main cause of vision loss in people with diabetes.

The study, published online in the journal Ophthalmology, was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research (DRCR) Network.

According to the U.S. National Eye Institute, DME occurs when fluid leaks into the center of the macula, the portion of the eye dedicated to sharp, straight-ahead vision. The condition is common in people with diabetic retinopathy, which affects up to 45 percent of people with diabetes.

The results of the new study ""appear to be applicable to most people who have DME in the center of the macula with some vision loss, whether the person has type 1 or type 2 diabetes, is old or young, or is a woman or a man,"" Dr. Neil M. Bressler, chair of the DRCR Network and chief of the retina division, Wilmer Eye Institute, at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine, said in a news release.

This is a ""seminal"" study,"" added Dr. George A. Williams, a board member of the American Academy of Ophthalmology and chair of the ophthalmology department at Oakland University William Beaumont School of Medicine.

""First and most importantly, it provides patients an improved therapy for diabetic macular edema. Second, the DRCR Network study is the first multi-center, randomized clinical trial to show how ranibizumab and the laser work together to improve treatment,"" Williams said.

The American Academy of Ophthalmology will review the study findings and make recommendations on whether Lucentis plus laser treatment should be the preferred treatment for a large number of patients with DME.

Researchers analyzed eye tissue from rats that drank green tea and found that the lens, retina and other tissues absorbed significant amounts of green tea catechins, which are antioxidants believed to protect the eye. Catechins include vitamin C, vitamin E, lutein and zeaxanthin.

The action of the green tea catechins in reducing harmful oxidative stress in the eyes lasted for up to 20 hours.

""Our results indicate that green tea consumption could benefit the eye against oxidative stress,"" wrote Chi Pui Pang of the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences at the Chinese University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong Eye Hospital, and colleagues.

WEDNESDAY, April 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers are reporting that a drug is showing promise in early testing as a possible new treatment for hepatitis C, a stubborn and potentially deadly liver ailment.

It's too early to tell if the drug actually works, and it will be years before it's ready to seek federal approval to be prescribed to patients. Still, the drug -- or others like it in development -- could add to the power of new drugs in the pipeline that are poised to cure many more people with hepatitis C, said Dr. Eugene R. Schiff, director of the University of Miami's Center for Liver Diseases.

The greater possibility of a cure and fewer side effects, in turn, will lead more people who think they have hepatitis C to ""come out of the woodwork,"" said Schiff, who's familiar with the study findings. ""They'll want to know if they're positive.""

An estimated 4 million people in the United States have hepatitis C, but only about 1 million are thought to have been diagnosed. The disease, transmitted through infected blood, can lead to liver cancer, scarring of the liver, known as cirrhosis, and death.

Existing treatments can cure about half of the cases. As Schiff explained, people's genetic makeup has a lot to do with whether they respond to the treatment. Those with Asian heritage do better, whereas those with an African background do worse, he said.

And there's another potential problem with existing treatments. The side effects, particularly of the treatment component known as interferon, can be ""pretty hard to deal with,"" said Nicholas A. Meanwell, a co-author of the study and a researcher with the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company.

The study, published online April 21 in Nature, examines an experimental drug designed to combat the hepatitis C virus. It appears to work by interfering with a protective coating around a part of the virus that's key to its ability to reproduce, Meanwell said.

In a phase 1 trial, the first of three types of studies that new drugs must go through, researchers gave doses of the drug to a small number of people.

The level of the virus in their bodies dropped significantly for several days. The main side effect was headache, Meanwell said.

At this point, it's not clear how much the drug might cost or how it would work with existing drugs. However, Meanwell said, it could become part of a combination treatment of several drugs.

Schiff, the University of Miami doctor, said other companies are pursuing similar drugs.

For now, much of the attention in the world of liver disease is on two drugs -- telaprevir and boceprevir -- that Schiff expects will become available within the next year and a half.

Combination treatments using these drugs will become the standard treatment for many people, he said, and boost cure rates into the range of 70 to 80 percent. The drugs now under development, like the one in the new study, could be added to the regimen, he said.

MONDAY, April 19, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An updated version of the standard prostate cancer test can help improve predictions about which men might not require immediate treatment, researchers report.

The basic test measures blood levels of prostate-specific androgen (PSA), a protein produced by prostate gland cells. But the standard PSA test cannot distinguish between cancers that grow so slowly they can safely be left alone and aggressive life-threatening tumors that call for surgery or radiation therapy.

The new test measures blood levels of three different types of PSA. Combined with annual biopsies, or tissue samples, it was about 70 percent accurate in singling out the aggressive tumors in a small study, John Hopkins University researchers were to report Sunday at the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, in Washington, D.C.

""What we have shown is that using the Prostate Health Index and tissue DNA measurement is informative in separating out patients whose cancers are likely to progress vs. those that are not likely to progress,"" said study leader Robert W. Veltri, an associate professor of urology and oncology at Hopkins.

Prostate Health Index is the name given to the test by Beckman Coulter Inc., which plans to market it.

The study included 71 men originally diagnosed as having small, low-grade and low-stage prostate cancer, the kind whose ultimate aggressiveness is often in doubt.

Currently, identifying the dangerous tumors in that group is no better than ""a coin-flip,"" Veltri said, and, as a result, many men and their doctors choose treatment that might be unnecessary and can cause impotence and other major problems.

Men in the trial had periodic blood tests that measured three different forms of PSA, including pro-PSA, a molecule in which two of the amino acids that make up the protein have been clipped off. It is the pro-PSA level that is most valuable as a predictor, Veltri said, but it is only one part of the study.

The new PSA test is given twice a year, along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor, and a yearly biopsy. The regimen found unfavorable indications for 39 of the cancers -- meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size -- and favorable for the 32 others, Veltri said. ""When you combine the DNA reading and the serum Prostate Health Index, it is accurate in about 7 out of 10 cases,"" he said.

But it was a small study, and ""it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index,"" Veltri said.

The Hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program's predictive value, he said. One hope is that the now-annual biopsies could be done every other year, Veltri said.

The study results have caused ""excitement,"" he said. ""Through active surveillance, we can identify a set of prostate cancer patients with low-grade tumors that may be able to have intervention deferred or delayed,"" Veltri said.

The Hopkins work was described as ""outstanding"" by Dr. William J. Catalona, director of the prostate cancer program at Northwestern Memorial Hospital's Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center, who pioneered the use of the standard PSA test and helped develop the new version of the test.

The test is awaiting approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and already is approved for use in Europe, Catalona said. In a study of 2,000 men in the Chicago area, ""we found it to be more accurate than the tests now available, and it also seems to identify the more aggressive prostate cancers,"" he said.

Another report at the same meeting described use of a microchip to detect tumor cells in the blood of people with prostate cancer. The presence of circulating cells can indicate spread of the cancer to other parts of the body, but they are so rare that they are invisible to current technology.

The new circulating tumor cell (CTC) chip identified such cells in nearly half of 20 people with early-stage prostate cancer and in two-thirds of people with advanced cancer, providing important prognostic information, researchers at Massachusetts General Hospital reported.

"Constant migraines may be from unlikely culprit: a deviated septum Constant migraines may be from an unlikely culprit: a deviated septum

Dr. Kevin Smith says frequent migraine sufferers shouldn't count out the possibility the pain may be from a deviated septum.

Photo: BILLY SMITH II, CHRONICLE Photo: BILLY SMITH II, CHRONICLE Image 1 of / 1 Caption Close Constant migraines may be from unlikely culprit: a deviated septum 1 / 1 Back to Gallery

If you suffer from chronic or migraine headaches, Dr. Kevin Smith urges you to consider the real problem might be in your nose.

Smith, an ear, nose and throat and facial plastic surgeon in Houston, has written The Migraine Imposter to help patients find a simpler cure for what can seem like a complex problem.

For 17 years Smith has treated patients who have been diagnosed with migraine headaches but really have a deviated septum, which occurs when the partition separating the left and right nasal airways becomes displaced.

He believes this deviation in the nose can touch sensitive tissue that, in turn, triggers episodic headaches, often mistaken as migraines. At least 32 million Americans are believed to be affected by migraines.

“What I am proposing is that if after you are referred to a neurologist and the MRI of your brain turns out negative (for tumor or aneurysm), your next step should be to get a CT scan of the sinuses,” Smith said.

If a CT scan shows a septal deviation, a 20-minute procedure called a septoplasty can often solve the problem. Smith said that within his practice, some 90 percent of patients have gotten headache relief after a deviated septum is repaired.

Symptoms to watch for include pain in the forehead, temple, area around the eyes, cheeks and top of the head, Smith said.

A deviated septum is often caused by trauma to your nose, such as having broken your nose, he said, adding that many professional athletes who suffer from migraines may actually have a deviated septum caused by contact sports.

“National Football League player Percy Harvin missed a lot of practice because of migraines,” Smith said. “If a deviated septum is caused by trauma and you have an NFL player with migraines who has been subjected to trauma by playing this sport, there is a high likelihood that he has a deviated septum.”

Houston resident Cheryl Guthrie isn't an athlete, but suffered from migraines since she was a little girl.

“Migraines are awful. You really can't function. I had seen Dr. Smith on a program and tucked (the information) away in a drawer,” Guthrie said. “Finally, he was my last resort.”

If Smith's hunch is correct, he believes septoplasties can have a big impact on finances and help patients find speedier relief. Often, he said, headache sufferers get passed around to doctors of many specialties, from general practitioners to ear, nose and throat specialists and neurosurgeons as well as oral surgeons, opthalmologists and pain specialists.

“These headaches can cost millions of dollars in lost revenue and a shortened career if sports players never find the reason for their headaches,” Smith said. “I also treated one lady who had suffered 15 years and had 14 MRIs performed in the brain before she was diagnosed with a septal deviation. I want to alleviate health care expenses and health care waste for my patients.”

To diagnose the problem, Smith said he sprays decongestant up a patients nose and then examines it to see if there are any bends in the back of the nose. A CT scan is then used to confirm the septal deviation.

Dr. Gina Rizzo of Gulfcoast MRI and Diagnostic Centers, agrees with Smith and urges physicians to consider this simple screening. “A screening of the sinuses should not be overlooked in the case of recurrent headaches that have been ruled out as tumors or aneurysms in the brain,” Rizzo said.

"April 13, 2010 -- Steve Peterson, 62, a home remodeler in Seattle, has rock-climbed in Tasmania, hiked in the high alpine regions of Washington, and trekked across the island of Manhattan -- all while sporting a knee brace due to painful knee osteoarthritis (OA), the wear-and-tear form of the disease that affects 27 million people.

When surgery failed to repair his damaged knee, Peterson's doctor suggested a knee brace. While Peterson was reluctant to try it at first, his wife all but insisted, and as a result, she got her hiking partner back, and to hear Peterson tell it, he got his life back.

""It absolutely gave me almost immediate relief,"" he says. ""By wearing the brace, I could get back to sports and was able to call my physician and say 'why didn't we try this first?'""

Knee braces basically help realign the knee; taking pressure off of damaged areas to relieve pain and restore function. Bracing is one of a number of noninvasive ways to treat knee OA and/or delay the need for joint replacement surgery.

New research presented at a media briefing Tuesday in New York City suggests that Peterson is not the only one to find relief from knee bracing. In a new study, 49 people with knee OA aged 45 to 87 who wore a knee brace had less pain, stiffness, and disability after six months of use.

All study participants led active lifestyles before they got sidelined by knee OA, and said they hoped to return to their previous level of activities. And by and large, they did. Their quality of life improved, and their activity level went from one that did not permit recreational sports to one that did.

The brace used in the study was provided by Ossur, which also provided financial support to the study through a research grant and sponsored the media briefing. The study was also presented at the recent annual meeting of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons in New Orleans.",0
"TUESDAY, April 13, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers report they've used magnets to guide stem cells to damaged areas of animal hearts.

The strategy appears to make it more likely that the heart will retain the cells, potentially boosting the power of cardiac stem cell therapy.

""Stem cell therapies show great promise as a treatment for heart injuries, but 24 hours after infusion, we found that less than 10 percent of the stem cells remain in the injured area,"" Dr. Eduardo Marban, director of the Cedars-Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles, said in a news release from the institute. ""Once injected into a patient's artery, many stem cells are lost due to the combination of tissue blood flow, which can wash out stem cells, and cardiac contraction, which can squeeze out stem cells. We needed to find a way to guide more of the cells directly to the area of the heart that we want to heal.""

Marban and colleagues developed a technique in which they loaded cardiac stem cells with microscopic bits of iron. Then they injected the cells into rats that had heart attacks and tried to manipulate the cells with a toy magnet.

The researchers found that magnetism attracted the stem cells to injured areas, tripling the retention rate in the heart.

""Tissue viability is enhanced and heart function is greater with magnetic targeting,"" Marban said. ""This remarkably simple method could easily be coupled with current stem cell treatments to enhance their effectiveness.""

Marban and his wife, Linda, are founders of a company that has filed patents for the techniques.

The study was published online April 8 in the journal Circulation Research.

"-- Avoid what are commonly called simple carbohydrates and ""sugary stuff"" at that meal or at bedtime. Such foods will bump up insulin production. ""When our insulin is very high, we can't get to sleep,"" he says. Instead, choose whole-wheat crackers, which can control insulin. Or eat turkey or bananas, both of which contain tryptophan, which is believed to trigger sleepiness. Lettuce, too, has a ""long history of helping people get to sleep,"" Aziz says.

-- Avoid caffeinated coffee, tea and soda. And alcohol, which Aziz says ""can make us go to sleep, but it's not the deep sleep"" that we need to produce growth hormone (which in turn helps regulate insulin).

-- Practice good sleep hygiene. That means turning off all electronics, including the TV, and creating as quiet a sleep space as you can. Lower blinds and turn off lights so your room is as dark as possible. Make sure the room temperature is comfortable. Consider taking a warm bath or doing some gentle stretches -- but not heart-pumping exercise -- before turning in.

Okay, so just how long are we supposed to stay asleep?

Robert Vorona, a sleep researcher at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, says adults should aim for 7 to 7 1/2 hours a night, while teenagers need a whopping 9 to 9 1/4 hours. (Fellow parents, let's do the math. If your teen has to get up at, say, 6:30 to be at school by 7:30, that means bedtime's at 9:15 or 9:30 p.m.)

Vorona says he'd like to delve deeper into the sleep-obesity question. He applied for funding of the research a few years ago, to no avail. ""It's a shame,"" he says. ""It's such an intriguing idea. If sleep extension could have a salutary effect on helping people lose weight,"" he says, we'd have another tool in the fight against obesity.

On the other hand, Vorona says, ""The last thing I want readers to think is that Dr. Vorona thinks we're facing this obesity epidemic because we're sleep deprived. I suspect it's part of the picture, along with lack of exercise and dietary indiscretion.""",1

WEDNESDAY, April 7, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers may have found an easy way to detect lung cancer in its early or even pre-cancerous stages, as well as a way to reverse the start of the deadly disease with a readily available, over-the-counter drug.

""It's incredibly, incredibly exciting,"" said Dr. Patrick Nana-Sinkam, a lung cancer expert with the Ohio State University Comprehensive Cancer Center, who was not involved with the new study. ""This definitely has potential.""

The minimally invasive procedure involves using a small brush to collect a smattering of cells from the windpipe (a bronchoscopy), explained study co-author Andrea Bild, an assistant professor of pharmacology and toxicology at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City.

Maybe one day, screening could be done using an even simpler nasal or sputum test, the researchers said.

Currently, there is no good way to detect lung cancer -- the number one cancer killer -- in its early stages when it's most treatable. By the time most lung cancers are diagnosed -- which usually involves an invasive examination of the lungs -- patients already have advanced malignancies. Only 15 percent of patients are still alive at five years, said Nana-Sinkam.

Cigarette smoking is responsible for 90 percent of all lung cancer cases in the United States.

Still, only 10 to 20 percent of smokers actually develop lung cancer, begging the question: Why do some smokers succumb to the disease and others don't.

Now genomics may have provided an answer.

Working on the theory that cigarettes harm not only the lungs but a ""field of injury"" extending to other areas of the respiratory tract, the study authors surmised that evidence of existing or soon-to-develop lung cancer might be available further up in the airway.

The researchers used so-called microarray genetic analysis to measure gene expression levels in the epithelial cells -- those cells lining the respiratory tract -- that they had captured with the bronchoscopy.

""We were looking at the activity of genes in the cells that we obtained from the windpipe or airways of smokers at risk for lung cancer,"" said study senior author Dr. Avrum Spira, a critical care physician at Boston Medical Center and associate professor of medicine, pathology and bioinformatics at Boston University School of Medicine.

It turned out that gene activity in the PI3K pathway was ""off the chart"" in smokers with lung cancer versus those without the disease.

""Obviously that's very exciting,"" Spira said. ""We have identified a marker for an early risk of developing lung cancer.""

And when treated with the compound myo-inositol, the gene pathway activity declined along with improvement in the troublesome lesions, the researcher noted.

""This drug inhibits the pathway that's activated in smokers. The drug is a natural compound. You can get it in health-food stores,"" Spira said.

""We're now in the midst of a large study to look at whether or not activity of this pathway can be used to pick those who could benefit from this as a treatment as opposed to just prevention,"" said Spira, who is a co-founder of Allegro Diagnostics Inc., a company that plans to market this biomarker.

The researchers also need to explore whether or not the PI3K pathway is active in non-smokers, as well as what other pathways might also trigger lung cancer.

The study findings were published in the April 7 issue of the journal Science Translational Medicine.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Researchers have identified a group of genes that are especially active in lung cancer patients — even in healthy tissue — and said they may be used to predict which smokers will eventually develop lung cancer.

And, they said, a natural supplement derived from food that is being tested to prevent lung cancer appears to halt the precancerous changes.

“Even in normal cells or premalignant cells prior to cancer development we see this pathway being turned on,” said Andrea Bild of the University of Utah, who worked on the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine.

The main gene is called PI3K and it affects a pathway of other genes, Bild, Avrum Spira of Boston University and colleagues reported. And it can be found in the windpipes of smokers, meaning they do not need more dangerous and uncomfortable lung tests.

“These cells are like a canary in the coal mine,” Spira said in a telephone interview. “Even though lung cancer develops deep down in your lungs when you smoke, these cells can tell you whether you are on the way to developing lung cancer. It is sort of a window into the lung.”

Cigarette smoke causes 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer, which kills 1.2 million people a year globally.

But only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes such as heart disease, stroke or emphysema.

Spira and Bild put together results from two ongoing trials of smokers.

“The patients walk in the door and they have something wrong with them — we don’t know what. Maybe they have lung cancer, maybe they have something else,” Bild said in a telephone interview.

Lung cancer is so deadly precisely because it causes vague symptoms. Most patients are not diagnosed until it has spread and can no longer be treated.

ACTIVE GENES

The researchers used a brush to collect cells from the windpipes of the smokers. They put these on a gene chip or microarray to see which genes were active in the cells.

“We found this certain pathway, PI3K, was turned on in patients that had lung cancer as opposed to patients that had other problems,” Bild said.

PI3K had long been suspected in lung cancer. But another experiment got the researchers more excited.

These were patients with precancerous lesions in their lungs called dysplasia. PI3K was also active in their lesions.

And the second group was taking the natural supplement, myo-inositol, to try to prevent lung cancer. In the patients whose lesions shrank after taking the supplement, PI3K also became less active, the researchers found.

“Together it gives us the story of the importance of this pathway,” Bild added. “Whether it is going to save millions of people, who knows?”

Spira said he is working with Boston-based Allegro Diagnostics, which is halfway through a 60-patient clinical trial of the test.

The researchers have patented their findings through the universities but Bild said myo-inositol supplements are cheap and freely available.

Myo-inositol is also found in fruits, beans, grains and nuts, although Bild said the finding does not necessarily explain why people who eat more of these foods have a lower risk of cancer in general.",1
"April 5, 2010 -- A new test may help identify smokers most at risk of developing emphysema.

Researchers found that measuring blood flow patterns in the lungs using a new type of multidetector row CT (MDCT) scan revealed subtle changes that may lead to emphysema in smokers with otherwise normal lungs.

Researcher Sara K. Alford of the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and colleagues say the results suggest that testing for blood flow disturbances in the lungs may provide an early warning for smokers most likely to develop the disease.

Emphysema is an incurable, progressive lung disease that primarily affects smokers and causes shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Although smoking is by far the most common cause of emphysema, some heavy smokers do not develop the disease for unknown reasons.

Recent research suggests that certain people may be more susceptible to the disease because of differences in how their lung tissue responds to inhaling tobacco.

In this study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that inhaling tobacco smoke inflamed parts of the lungs and altered blood flow as the smoker's lungs attempted to get oxygen.

Researchers say areas of low blood flow in inflamed lung tissue can promote tissue damage and inhibit repair of damaged tissues, which eventually develops into the symptoms of emphysema.

In the study, researchers used MDCT scans to measure blood flow differences in 17 nonsmokers and 24 smokers. Based on differences in blood flow, researchers could tell the differences between people who had never smoked, people who smoked and had no signs of emphysema, and people who smoked and had subtle, early signs of emphysema.

Based on the scans, people who had early signs of emphysema had the most disturbed blood flow patterns in otherwise healthy lungs.

If confirmed by further studies, researchers say this type of testing could help determine who is most at risk of developing emphysema, measure the extent of the disease, and target and test new treatments for the disease.",0

Smell function improved in eight patients in the acupuncture group and in two patients in the vitamin B group. The findings suggest that acupuncture may be a new treatment option for patients with PVOD, the researchers reported in the April issue of the journal Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.

There is no validated drug treatment for PVOD. Current treatments include systemic and topical steroids, vitamin B supplements, caroverine, and alpha lipoic acid. In addition to these treatments, many patients use complementary and alternative medicines, the researchers noted.

FRIDAY, March 26, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs known as beta blockers appears to help reduce the spread of breast cancer in women, a team of British and German researchers report.

The drugs are believed to work by preventing stress hormones from stimulating cancer cells. ""Beta- blocker drugs compete with stress hormones and bind to the same target receptors [on a cellular level], but unlike stress hormones, do not activate cancer cells,"" said Dr. Des Powe, a senior healthcare research scientist at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust, in Nottingham, England.

Powe is due to present the findings Friday at the annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain.

Powe and his colleagues from the U.K. and Germany evaluated 466 cancer patients: 92 had received blood pressure-lowering medications and 43 of those 92, or nearly half, were on beta blockers at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis.

Those on beta blockers had a substantial reduction in the formation of distant cancers, or metastases, and of local recurrence. They had a 71 percent reduced risk of death from breast cancer during the study compared to those who were either taking other blood pressure drugs or weren't on any blood pressure medications. Those on beta blockers also had a 57 percent reduced risk of getting a secondary cancer.

""Our study was performed retrospectively, using patient notes [from women] that had received treatment in the late 1980s and 1990s,"" Powe said.

Other experts called the results interesting, but preliminary. ""The concept of controlling tumor growth by preventing a stress or inflammatory response is not novel,"" said Dr. Cathie Chung, a medical oncologist and an assistant professor of oncology at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif.

For instance, other research has found that women with breast cancer who regularly take aspirin, which is an anti-inflammatory, may have a decreased risk of recurrence.

""I think this study is interesting, but very far from being conclusive,"" said Chung. It's not known, she said, whether there is a true association or whether it may be due to chance or another factor.

""There is more work to be done before you can say whether this relationship is meaningful and will hold up,"" agreed Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society.

As in other retrospective studies, he said, more research is needed to verify the potential link.

""There are many other factors that come into play that could explain what happened,"" Lichtenfeld said. ""What if the women who take the beta blockers are more attuned to their health and they may be taking better care of themselves?""

Like Chung, he agreed the proposed association is not far-fetched, just that more study is needed. Previous research, Lichtenfeld said, has found a reduced rate of skin cancer among men who take another type of blood pressure-lowering drug.

Powe said he plans to do another study to validate the results.

"Cataracts are the leading cause of blindness in the world, and are often related to aging. In a common form of cataracts, proteins in the lens change over time, developing chromophores — molecular add-ons that absorb color in the blue part of the spectrum. Chromophores reduce the amount of light reaching the retina (and give the lens a yellow-brown appearance), but they also disrupt the structure of the lens proteins, causing light to scatter.

Cataracts can be treated by lens-replacement surgery, but the procedure is invasive and costly, requiring special equipment and skilled eye surgeons. To make cataract treatment available to more people around the world, a less-invasive, less-expensive technique is needed.

Line Kessel, an ophthalmologist at Glostrup Hospital of the University of Copenhagen in Denmark, and colleagues have come up with what they say is a promising alternative to replacement surgery. In their approach, described in the open-access journal PLoS ONE, they “bleach” the lens with a laser.

Ultraviolet light can alter chromophores so they no longer absorb color, but UV light can damage the retina. So the researchers use infrared light, delivered by an extremely fast-pulse laser. The pulses are so fast, Dr. Kessel said, that two photons hit a target molecule simultaneously, with the same effect as if UV light was used.

The laser treatment reduces the light absorption and also helps restore the lens proteins to their proper structure. Much more research and development work remains, Dr. Kessel said, but the goal is a relatively simple procedure that would last half an hour at most and use largely automated equipment in mobile clinics.",1

TUESDAY, March 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A new form of inhaled insulin appears to help people with diabetes who must use insulin, with fewer potential risks than an earlier form of inhaled insulin that is no longer on the market.

The new drug, Afrezza, which is awaiting approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, works faster, keeps blood sugar levels at a closer to normal level and has less risk of causing low blood sugar levels (hypoglycemia) than currently available injectable insulins, researchers say. It also appears to have less risk of causing lung problems than its inhaled predecessor, Exubera.

""Afrezza is an ultra-rapid-acting insulin, and clinical studies have shown us that it has the potential to change diabetes therapy, because in the body, Afrezza looks like the insulin that's normally in a person's body,"" said Andrea Leone-Bay, vice president of pharmaceutical development for MannKind Corp., manufacturer of Afreeza.

""Afrezza differs a lot from Exubera,"" she said, both in the way it's made and in the way it works.

Afrezza uses a novel technology called Technosphere, according to Leone-Bay. It's inhaled as a dry powder that dissolves in the lungs. The particles then pass through the lungs into the bloodstream and begin acting almost immediately. Afrezza's action peaks about 12 to 15 minutes after inhalation, instead of the 45 to 60 minutes it takes for Exubera to peak, she said.

That fast action helps to keep after-meal blood sugar levels lower, which is a goal for people with diabetes. And Afrezza is less likely to cause hypoglycemia, a common problem that occurs when insulin levels are higher than required for a meal.

The idea of an inhaled insulin appeals to diabetics who must use insulin every time they eat. Currently, the only way to get that insulin is through injection or an insulin pump that must be inserted in a new site under the skin every few days.

In 2006, the first inhaled insulin, Exubera, received FDA approval. However, the drug was pulled from the market in October 2007 by its manufacturer, Pfizer, because of disappointing sales. From the beginning, concerns surfaced about the effects the drug might have on the lungs. One study found a reduction in lung function for some, but of more concern was an increased risk of lung cancer associated with its use. This finding came after Exubera had been pulled from the market, and the sample size wasn't large enough to draw a definitive link between the drug and the increased risk of lung cancer.

Leone-Bay said that cancer studies have been conducted on Afrezza in rats. The rats got a much higher inhalation dose than humans would take, and the researchers didn't find an increase in lung cancer. She said these types of studies weren't done on Exubera.

""They have done the required safety studies and come out clean, but it's only been tested for six months, so long-term isn't known,"" said Sanjoy Dutta, director of the insulin initiative at the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation.

Dutta confirmed that Afrezza is fast-acting and less likely to cause low blood sugar. ""Just as quickly as it has an onset of action, it also has a quick off mechanism. It doesn't stay around long enough to cause hypoglycemia,"" he said.

While Afrezza looks promising, it can't replace all injections for people with diabetes. Because it's fast-acting, it can't provide the long action of insulin known as basal insulin. It will only replace meal-time insulin.

Afrezza may have an impact on lung function, but Leone-Bay said once people stopped taking Afrezza, this effect went away. The company is conducting clinical trials to assess Afrezza in people with asthma.

Leone-Bay was to explain the Technosphere technology Tuesday at the American Chemical Society annual meeting in San Francisco. MannKind hopes the technology used in Afrezza might help deliver drugs that treat pain and osteoporosis, too.

"TUESDAY, March 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- An ingredient in agave -- the plant used to make tequila -- may help fight bone-weakening osteoporosis and other diseases, Mexican researchers say.

Agave, artichokes, garlic, onions and chicory are rich, natural sources of fructans -- nondigestible carbohydrates consisting of molecules of fructose linked together into chains, according to background information in a news release from the American Chemical Society.

""Experimental studies suggest that fructans may be beneficial in diabetes, obesity, stimulating the immune system of the body, decreasing levels of disease-causing bacteria in the intestine, relieving constipation and reducing the risk of colon cancer,"" Mercedes Lopez, of the National Polytechnic Institute in Guanajuato, said in the news release.

Previous research has also suggested that fructans stimulate the growth of beneficial bacteria in the large intestine in a way that increases the body's absorption of minerals, including calcium and magnesium, which are needed for bone growth.

In this study, Lopez and colleagues tested the effects of agave fructans on bone growth in mice. Compared to other mice, those fed agave fructans absorbed more calcium from food, excreted less calcium in their feces, and had a 50 percent increase in levels of a protein associated with the build-up of new bone tissue.

""These results suggest that the supplementation of the standard diet with agave fructans prevented bone loss and improved bone formation, indicating the important role of agave fructans on the maintenance of healthy bone,"" Lopez said. ""They can be used in many products for children and infants to help prevent various diseases, and can even be used in ice cream as a sugar substitute.""

But drinking tequila won't help, the study authors noted. The fructans turn into alcohol when agave is processed into tequila, they said.

The study was to be presented Tuesday at the national meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco.

Angioplasty is a procedure to open blocked arteries.

Danish researchers analyzed data from more than 31,000 patients hospitalized with heart attack between 2000 and 2005 and divided the patients into four groups: two groups with heart failure (one that received Plavix and one that did not) and two groups without heart failure (one that received Plavix and one that did not).

The mean follow-up was 18 months for both heart failure groups and just over two years for both non-heart failure groups.

There were 812 deaths (32.2 percent) among heart failure patients not treated with Plavix and 709 deaths (28.1 percent) among heart failure patients treated with Plavix. There were 294 deaths (9.7 percent) among non-heart-failure patients not treated with Plavix and 285 deaths (9.4 percent) among non-heart failure patients who were given the drug.

The study appears online March 23 and in the March 30 print issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology.

The value of giving clopidogrel (Plavix) to heart failure patients has been ""long debated,"" a researcher from the HeartDrug Research Laboratories at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore wrote in an accompanying editorial.

He said the benefit of the drug found in this study is ""of unquestionable practical importance,"" and added that the positive outcomes seen in a relatively short follow-up suggests potentially even better long-term survival.

The finding, reported in the journal Nature on Sunday, offers early proof that a new treatment approach called RNA interference or RNAi might work in people.

RNA stands for ribonucleic acid — a chemical messenger that is emerging as a key player in the disease process.

Dozens of biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies including Alnylam, Merck, Pfizer, Novartis and Roche are looking for ways to manipulate RNA to block genes that make disease-causing proteins involved in cancer, blindness or AIDS.

But getting the treatment to the right target in the body has presented a challenge.

A team at the California Institute of Technology in Pasadena used nanotechnology — the science of really small objects — to create tiny polymer robots covered with a protein called transferrin that seek out a receptor or molecular doorway on many different types of tumors.

“This is the first study to be able to go in there and show it’s doing its mechanism of action,” said Mark Davis, a professor of chemical engineering, who led the study.

“We’re excited about it because there is a lot of skepticism whenever any new technology comes in,” said Davis, a consultant to privately held Calando Pharmaceuticals Inc, which is developing the therapy.

Other teams are using fats or lipids to deliver the therapy to the treatment target. Pfizer last week announced a deal with Canadian biotech Tekmira Pharmaceuticals Corp for this type of delivery vehicle for its RNAi drugs, joining Roche and Alnylam.

In the approach used by Davis and colleagues, once the particles find the cancer cell and get inside, they break down, releasing small interfering RNAs or siRNAs that block a gene that makes a cancer growth protein called ribonucleotide reductase.

“In the particle itself, we’ve built what we call a chemical sensor,” Davis said in a telephone interview. “When it recognizes that it’s gone inside the cell, it says OK, now it’s time to disassemble and give off the RNA.”

In a phase 1 clinical trial in patients with various types of tumors, the team gave doses of the targeted nanoparticles four times over 21 days in a 30-minute intravenous infusion.

Tumor samples taken from three people with melanoma showed the nanoparticles found their way inside tumor cells.

And they found evidence that the therapy had disabled ribonucleotide reductase, suggesting the RNA had done its job.

Davis could not say whether the therapy helped shrink tumors in the patients, but one patient did get a second cycle of treatment, suggesting it might be. Nor could he say if there were any safety concerns.

Davis said that part of the study will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in June.",1

SUNDAY, March 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- For the first time in humans, scientists have successfully used a gene-manipulation therapy to enter tumor cells and block the production of toxic proteins that are causing cancer, researchers report.

""They're basically putting an instruction booklet into the cell saying, 'We don't want this protein expressed for now,'"" explained Gregory Adams, co-leader of the developmental therapeutics program at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia. ""It's pretty amazing. It's potentially huge.""

""This is something we've been waiting to see,"" he continued.

""This directly interferes with the genetic mechanisms that promote cancer to stop the production of a particular protein,"" added Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society. ""This is one step away from getting into the actual DNA.""

As reported online March 21 in Nature, this is the first time the process, known as RNA interference (RNAi), has been shown to work in humans.

The process of RNA interference involves putting two strands of RNA together to form so-called ""small interfering RNAs"" (siRNAs) and inserting them into cells. Once there, these interlopers cut the messenger RNA (mRNA) that is ordinarily used to make specific proteins. This discovery won the Nobel Prize in 2006.

But the work that nabbed the prize was done in worms -- a far cry from humans.

And there were other challenges, not the least of which was how to get the siRNAs into the appropriate cell and then make sure they did what they were supposed to do.

This team, from the California Institute of Technology (CalTech), devised a super-small nanoparticle system that, when injected into the body, would make its way to the tumor, deposit the siRNAs into the tumor cell and leave them to their assigned task.

This early-phase clinical trial involved actual patients with melanoma, a particularly virulent form of skin cancer.

The experiment proceeded just as planned, as biopsies later showed.

The researchers injected the cargo-laden nanoparticles into the patients, much as you would administer a flu or any other type of shot. They did not inject directly into the tumor as many other researchers have done.

The nanoparticles made their way smoothly to the target -- the tumor cell -- and cleaved the mRNA in just the right place, stopping production of the culprit protein.

The precision of the process is crucial to limiting side effects, the researchers said.

""Now you can go selectively at proteins involved in the disease and not have off-target effects,"" explained Mark E. Davis, lead author of the paper, and professor of chemical engineering at CalTech in Pasadena. ""Normally when you make drugs, it's hard to say 'attack only that protein.' In this particular case, I'm going to go in at the genetic level and eliminate that one protein I want to eliminate.""

And unlike conventional gene therapy -- where the offending gene is replaced by a new one or overridden -- this therapy is reversible, said Adams.

""This will run its course. Ultimately, it will restore itself,"" he said.

The authors believe the same system could provide a highly targeted, selective way to reach many different genes and affect tumors that have untll now eluded drug therapy.

Obviously, the process will have to be refined and optimized before it's actually used for treatment.

""This is the first qualitative 'yes, we can do it' publication and it really has to be kept in that perspective,"" Adams said.

"March 16, 2010 -- An experimental type of highly focused radiation therapy may control inoperable lung cancer tumors and help people with the deadly disease live longer.

A new study shows stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) effectively controlled more than 87% of early-stage inoperable non-small-cell lung cancer tumors for up to three years. Researchers say that rate of tumor control is more than double that found with conventional radiation treatment for inoperable lung cancer.

Researchers say surgical removal of tumors is the standard treatment for early-stage lung cancer, but some people are not candidates for surgery due to other coexisting illnesses such as emphysema and heart disease.

In these situations, the lung cancer tumor is deemed inoperable and conventional radiation therapy or observation without cancer treatment is offered. Neither option is considered ideal.

""Conventional radiotherapy fails to durably control the primary lung tumor in 60 percent to 70 percent of patients. More than half of patients ultimately die specifically from progressive lung cancer with observation, and 2-year survival is less than 40 percent with either approach,"" write researcher Robert Timmerman, MD, of the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center, Dallas, and colleagues in the Journal of the American Medical Association.

In the study, researchers evaluated the safety and effectiveness of SBRT in treating 55 people with early-stage but medically inoperable lung cancer.

SBRT is a noninvasive type of cancer treatment in which many small, highly focused radiation beams are used to deliver concentrated doses of radiation to tumor targets over a series of one to five treatments.

Three years after the treatment, the study showed that 28 participants had a complete response to the therapy and 21 had a partial response. Fourteen participants had recurrence of cancer.

Overall, the rate of complete plus partial response after therapy was 89%. Disease-free survival and overall survival three years after treatment were 48.3% and 55.8%, respectively.

Nineteen participants (16.3%) experienced significant but not deadly treatment-related side effects.

This type of radiation therapy has not yet been approved by the FDA as a lung cancer treatment, but this study brings it one step closer. The next step is a clinical trial to evaluate the therapy in a larger number of patients and determine the proper dosage for maximum benefit and minimal risk.",1

WEDNESDAY, March 10, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A thyroid-derived cholesterol-lowering drug that could be an alternative to the widely used statin medications has done well in a small, early trial, Swedish and American researchers report.

In the trial, various doses of the drug, eprotirome, a laboratory-engineered version of thyroid hormone, were added to statin treatment for 168 people whose high levels of LDL cholesterol had not been lowered by previous use of statins. The combination did lower cholesterol levels in the 12-week trial and, most importantly, did not cause the feared side effects on the heart and other organs that have plagued similar thyroid-based treatments.

""There was no doubt that eprotirome would lower LDL cholesterol. Thyroid hormone is nature's own statin,"" said Dr. Paul W. Ladenson, a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine and lead author of a report on the trial, published in the March 11 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. ""But this is a demonstration of lipid-lowering effect without thyroid toxicity.""

Dr. Bo Angelin, a professor of clinical metabolic research at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, where the drug was developed, said that the trial demonstrated that careful targeting of the drug's effect within the body could obtain the benefits of thyroid hormone on blood cholesterol levels, without causing damaging side effects. The trial was funded in part by Karo Bio, a small commercial spinoff of the institute.

""We knew that thyroid hormone could lower lipid [cholesterol] levels but would have side effects on the circulation and bones and cause diarrhea,"" Angelin said. ""Even if the lipid levels were OK, it would be overall negative for patients.""

However, he added, ""if we can get the thyroid effect in the liver [where cholesterol is metabolized] but not in other organs, we would be OK.""

Frequent monitoring showed no ill effects on the hearts and bones of those taking the drug, the report said.

And though statins are widely used and most often successful, an alternative to them would be welcome, Ladenson said. Statins are not effective in up to a quarter of potential users because of unacceptable muscle pain or simple failure to lower cholesterol levels, he said.

""The first importance of the trial is that it shows hepatic [liver] targeting of hormonal action,"" Ladenson said. ""The second exciting part is its impact on lipids other than LDL cholesterol.""

Though statins lower LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, they have no effect on other blood fats, such as lipoprotein A, which is believed to be equally damaging, Ladenson said. He said that significant reductions of blood levels of those fats were seen in the trial.

Larger and longer studies are needed to determine whether eprotirome will have the hoped-for effect on blood fat levels without side effects and will ultimately reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases, both Ladenson and Angelin said, adding that such trials now are in the planning stages.

At best, results would not be available for ""at least two to three years,"" Angelin said.

If eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully, its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin, Angelin said. Use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow, first in selected patients, then more widely, he said.

It's best to move cautiously, agreed Dr. Robert M. Califf, vice chancellor for clinical research at Duke University.

""The effects on LDL cholesterol and lipoproteins are pretty exciting,"" Califf said. ""But if there is one thing we've learned about drugs in this arena, it's that we need large trials to see how they measure up in terms of risk and benefit.""

The trial's researchers were careful to list indications of possible harmful side effects, such as a reduction in levels of HDL (""good"") cholesterol, Califf said. But he echoed the thought that a longer-term and larger test is needed to determine the incidence of some possible major side effects, such as impotence.

""I'm not sure I'd want to sign up for that one before I had longer-term results,"" Califf said. ""Being impotent is no fun.""

In a study of 232 people taking medication for psoriasis, those who also took statins had fewer of the thick, red, scaly, itchy patches that are the hallmark sign of psoriasis, compared with people who didn't take the cholesterol-lowering drugs.

""There was a trend toward less severe psoriasis severity in people taking statins,"" says researcher Adam Perry, a fourth-year medical student at Emory University in Atlanta.

"SATURDAY, March 6, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Electromagnetic pulses from a portable device can significantly reduce pain and inflammation in people suffering from osteoarthritis of the knee, a new study suggests.

Researchers gave a battery-operated device to 34 people, who used it to emit a low-intensity, pulsating, electromagnetic frequency to their knees. The participants experienced pain relief of more than 40 percent on the first day of treatment, according to the study.

The approach has no side effects, is ""relatively low-cost in the long-run and the onset of pain relief is immediate,"" Dr. Fred Nelson, associate program director for research and director of the Osteoarthritis Center at Henry Ford Hospital, said in a hospital news release. ""We look at electromagnetic pulses as a potential way to improve quality of life and independence for those who suffer from osteoarthritis of the knee.""

The electromagnetic pulses are thought to reduce the level of calcium in cartilage cells and set off a process that reduces inflammation.

""We are really fine-tuning what we are doing to the cell environment with a very specific pulse sequence and frequency,"" Nelson said.

For the study, people wore the device around their knees for 15 minutes, twice a day for six weeks.

"March 4, 2010 -- A new urine test may reduce unnecessary biopsies for prostate cancer.

The test, which is approved in some European countries but not in the U.S., detects genetic material -- RNA -- from prostate cancer gene 3 or PCA3.

At a news briefing held in advance of the 2010 Genitourinary Cancers Symposium, researchers presented results of the largest study to date of the PCA3 test. It showed that the test accurately predicts whether a prostate biopsy will reveal cancer in high-risk men.

PCA3 is found only in the prostate. When prostate cells become cancerous, their PCA3 genes go crazy. Prostate cancer cells express up to 100 times more PCA3 RNA than do normal cells.

The PCA3 test can do things the PSA test can't, says Jack Groskopf, PhD, of Gen-Probe Inc., which manufactures the test and funded the new research.

The PSA test detects prostate-specific antigen, a protein given off by all prostate cells. If a man has any type of damage to the prostate, his PSA level can go up. ""More often than not, the damage is due to benign (noncancerous) conditions such as enlarged prostate"" -- a condition called benign prostatic hyperplasia or BPH, Groskopf tells WebMD.

This often triggers unnecessary biopsies and, sometimes, unnecessary surgery.

The PCA3 test isn’t a replacement for PSA testing. But it improves the ability to diagnose prostate cancer, Groskopf says.",0

"* Bapineuzumab cuts amyloid plaque by 25 pct in small study

* Encouraging result after clinical trial setback in 2008

* Drug being developed by Pfizer, Elan and Johnson & Johnson

By Ben Hirschler

LONDON, March 1 (Reuters) - New imaging technology suggests an experimental drug for Alzheimer’s reduces clumps of plaque in the brain by around 25 percent, lifting hopes for a medicine that disappointed in clinical tests two years ago.

Bapineuzumab — being developed by Pfizer Inc (PFE.N), Irish drugmaker Elan Corp ELN.I and Johnson & Johnson (JNJ.N) — is a potential game-changer because it could be the first drug to treat the underlying cause of the degenerative brain disease.

Investor confidence in the antibody medicine, however, took a big hit in July 2008 when it failed to meet its main goal in a mid-stage trial and caused brain swelling at higher doses. The new study, which only involved 28 patients, is modest fillip.

“It demonstrated that the drug has an effect on the pathological hallmark of Alzheimer’s disease,” lead researcher Juha Rinne from Finland’s University of Turku told Reuters.

Rinne and colleagues used a novel imaging substance called carbon-11-labelled Pittsburgh compound B, which sticks to areas of the brain where there is a lot of beta amyloid plaque.

After 78 weeks, they found that patients given bapineuzumab had about a 25 percent reduction in plaque compared with those on placebo. The effect was similar with three different doses of the drug, they reported in the journal Lancet Neurology.

The treatment was generally well tolerated, although two patients on the highest dose had transient brain swelling. The drug’s developers have since dropped the top dose from large ongoing Phase III trials.

Commenting on the results, Sam Gandy from New York’s Mount Sinai School of Medicine said it was too early to say effective disease-modifying drugs were at hand, but the ability to measure plaque in living subjects was “something of a breakthrough”.

Experts are divided on the root cause of Alzheimer’s and hence the best way to tackle it.

Most advanced drugs, like bapineuzumab, have focused on removing clumps of amyloid plaques, which are thought to stop brain cells from functioning properly. But a rival school blames toxic tangles caused by an abnormal build-up of the protein tau.

Rinne’s imaging study was funded by Elan and Wyeth, which is now part of Pfizer. (Editing by Jon Loades-Carter)",1
"Cleveland, Ohio (CNN) -- Diana Tirpak was so sure her leukemia was going to kill her, she bought a suit for her husband, Jake, to wear at her funeral.

""I was bound and determined he was going to look fine at the funeral,"" says Tirpak, 68, a retired school nurse in Hudson, Ohio.

Until recently, Tirpak would have faced a death sentence without a bone marrow transplant. But Tirpak's physician, Dr. Mary Laughlin, turned to something deemed medical waste until recently: umbilical cord blood.

Cord blood is rich in stem cells and easier to match than adult bone marrow because the immune cells are not developed. Also, patients can get the treatment in about three weeks -- as opposed to six to eight for bone marrow from an adult donor, said Laughlin, founder and medical director of the Cleveland Cord Blood Center.

""That can be a critical time interval for a patient who is in remission,"" she said, noting that doctors often fear a patient's relapse while awaiting the transplant.

Traditionally, patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma have first tried to find an adult bone marrow donor either from a close relative or from a national bone marrow registry. But the registry's more than 12 million donors meet the needs of only about 60 percent of Caucasians in the United States and only 5 to 15 percent of minorities, who are underrepresented. Even siblings are not a sure thing, with the chance of matching a brother or sister only 25 percent.

Nathan Mumford, who is African-American, tried to find a bone marrow donor after his leukemia was diagnosed not long after he graduated from college.

""We went through that process, and nobody had a match. Siblings are the best matches. My brother or my sister wasn't a match. My friends, aunts, uncles, cousins, nobody was a match. So, couldn't go that route,"" Mumford said.

At that point, Mumford said, his choices were to continue chemotherapy and live for, maybe, another year and a half. Or he could try a cord blood stem cell transplant.

""That was an opportunity,"" said Mumford, who survived Hodgkin's disease as a child. ""That was a chance for me to live. I'm not a quitter. I've never been a quitter, so I wasn't going to quit.""

Mumford received a cord blood stem cell transplant in November 2004. In such transplants, patients have chemotherapy, radiation or both to kill the cancer cells and to suppress the immune system so that the new stem cells are not rejected. Then, the stem cells are injected into the patient's body and travel to the bone marrow cavities, where they create new, healthy marrow. Mumford, who's now 30, says he's never felt better.

""I just feel amazing,"" he said. ""I have a lot of energy, and I'm just excited about it.""

Mumford lives in Cleveland and runs the Karen E. Mumford Foundation. The nonprofit, named for his mother, who died of breast cancer while he was being treated, provides emotional and financial assistance to cancer patients.

Tirpak and Mumford represent a growing number of patients taking advantage of stem cells from cord blood, which can be used in patients with leukemia, lymphoma and myeloma. Cord blood transplants among unrelated donors have risen from 1 percent in 2001 to 24 percent last year, Laughlin says.

Nationally, more than 200 hospitals accept cord blood donations. Parents must decide before birth whether to bank a child's cord blood. If they do, it's collected immediately after birth, processed, registered in a national database and kept frozen. If collected and stored for private use, the procedure can cost as much as $2,000 or more, plus annual storage fees.

Public blood banks collect and store the cord blood free of charge. Those parents get their own child's blood unless it has already been given out as a match for someone else. In that case, other matching blood is made available free of charge.

Cord blood stem cell transplants have the same risks as adult bone marrow transplants: the new blood rejecting the host, called graft-versus-host disease. And patients still must endure months of recovery. Well worth it, say Mumford and Tirpak, who received her stem cell injection two years ago.

""Such a tiny few drops of blood cells really give new birth to people,"" Tirpak said.

On Saturday, her husband, Jake, finally wore the suit he had been saving for his wife's funeral -- at a family wedding.",1
"Acupuncture designed to treat depression appears to improve symptoms in pregnant women, suggesting it as an alternative to antidepressant medication during pregnancy, a study found.

The study, published Monday in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, is the largest to date examining the effectiveness of acupuncture to treat depression in pregnant women. It was funded by a grant from the government's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality. ""Acupuncture that we have tested works for pregnant, depressed women,"" said Rachel Manber, a study author and professor at Stanford University. However, ""no single study is enough to make policy recommendations,"" she said.

Depression in pregnancy is a risk factor for postpartum depression. Postpartum depression is associated in some studies with poorer cognitive and emotional development in children. Some have linked depression in pregnancy and low birth weight.

As many as 14% of pregnant women are thought to develop a significant depression at some point during their pregnancy, according to the study authors, comparable to numbers who suffer from postpartum depression. Antidepressants are generally considered safe for use in pregnancy, but research has been limited and concerns continue to grow, according to the National Institute of Mental Health. One study showed that the risk of persistent pulmonary hypertension, a potentially serious lung condition, is significantly greater in newborns whose mother took antidepressants later in pregnancy. The Food and Drug Administration recommends that patients and physicians ""carefully consider and discuss together"" the benefits and risks taking antidepressants during pregnancy.""Antidepressants are not an attractive option for many women,"" said Dr. Manber. ""Many women are concerned about using antidepressant medication during pregnancy.""

Acupuncture, based on ancient Chinese medicine, attempts to treat conditions by stimulating points on the body, most often with needles stuck in the skin and moved by hand or electrical stimulation, according to the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine.

In the study, 150 clinically depressed pregnant women who weren't previously taking antidepressants were randomly assigned to get either acupuncture for depression, acupuncture not specifically designed for depression, or massage for eight weeks. Those who got acupuncture targeting depression had a significantly greater decrease in depressive symptoms, compared with the other women. Some 63% of women in the acupuncture-for-depression group responded to treatment, compared with 44% in the other groups.

There wasn't a difference between the groups in full recovery from the depression. Though this study didn't compare acupuncture for depression with another active treatment, the response rates are comparable to those rates from other depression treatments in studies of non-pregnant individuals, Dr. Manber said. And future work needs to examine how acupuncture for depression compares with standard treatment like antidepressants or psychotherapy, as well as who responds to treatment and what the optimal dose of the acupuncture treatment should be.

TUESDAY, Feb. 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A popular nutritional supplement -- extract of bitter melon -- may help protect women from breast cancer, researchers say.

Bitter melon is a common vegetable in India, China and South America, and its extract is used in folk remedies for diabetes because of its blood-sugar lowering capabilities, according to the researchers.

""When we used the extract from that melon, we saw that it kills the breast cancer cells,"" said lead researcher Ratna Ray, a professor of pathology at Saint Louis University. But their work was done in a laboratory, not in humans, she noted.

The bitter melon extract killed only the cancer cells, not the healthy breast cells. ""We didn't see any death in the normal cells,"" she said.

However, these results are not proof that bitter melon extract prevents or cures breast cancer.

""I don't believe that it will cure cancer,"" Ray said. ""It will probably delay or perhaps have some prevention.""

The report was published online Feb. 23 in advance of print publication March 1 in Cancer Research.

For the study, Ray's team treated human breast cancer cells with bitter melon extract, which is sold in U.S. health food stores and over the Internet.

The extract slowed the growth of these breast cancer cells and even killed them, the researchers found. The next step is to see if the team can repeat these findings in animals, Ray said. If so, human trials might follow.

Eating bitter melon could also have a beneficial effect, Ray said. ""It has ingredients which are good for the health."" Those ingredients include Vitamin C and flavonoids.

Marji McCullough, strategic director of nutritional epidemiology at the American Cancer Society, expressed interest in the findings.

""The results of this laboratory study are intriguing,"" McCullough said. ""But before recommending bitter melon extract supplements for cancer prevention, we need appropriate clinical trials to establish its safety and efficacy in humans.""

For now, the cancer society recommends getting nutrients through foods, not supplements, McCullough said.

This involves eating ""a plant-based diet including a variety of vegetables and fruits,"" she said. ""Many supplements have biologic activity, but before I recommend that people take isolated supplements they need to be tested in humans.""

Current recommendations to prevent breast cancer include maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol, exercising and eating a healthful diet, McCullough said.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - For pregnant women with depression, a couple months of acupuncture might help reduce the severity of their symptoms, a small study hints.

The study, which followed 150 pregnant women with major depression, tested “depression-specific” acupuncture against massage and acupuncture sessions that, according to traditional Chinese medicine, does not specifically target depression.

Researchers found that after eight weeks, women who received depression-specific acupuncture were more likely to have a treatment response — meaning the severity of their symptoms fell by at least half and they no longer met all of the criteria for diagnosing major depression.

Overall, 63 percent responded to the therapy, versus 37 percent of the “control” acupuncture group and half of the massage group, according to findings published in the medical journal Obstetrics & Gynecology.

But while the findings are promising, questions still remain — including whether acupuncture as practiced in the real world can reliably help women with depression.

“The acupuncture protocol we have tested appears effective,” lead researcher Dr. Rachel Manber, of Stanford University in California, told Reuters Health in an email.

“However,” she added, “unlike a pill, which always has the same ingredients, acupuncture, like psychotherapy, varies from one provider to the other.”

So while the specific regimen used in this study appeared effective, Manber said, “I do not think we can say that our study proves that acupuncture is effective for depression during pregnancy.”

It’s estimated that 3 to 5 percent of pregnant women are diagnosed with depression, Manber and her colleagues note in their report. Antidepressant medications are one treatment option, but there are safety concerns.

One recent study, for example, found that pregnant women who started taking selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) in the second or third trimester had a higher risk of preterm delivery than other women. SSRIs include drugs like sertraline (Zoloft), paroxetine

(Paxil) and fluoxetine (Prozac).

Because of the potential for harm from medications, many pregnant women with depression may prefer psychotherapy or other non-drug options.

Acupuncture has been used for more than 2,000 years in Chinese medicine to treat a wide variety of ailments. According to traditional medicine, specific acupuncture points on the skin are connected to internal pathways that conduct energy, or qi (“chee”), and stimulating these points with a fine needle promotes the healthy flow of qi.

Modern research has most often focused on the effects of acupuncture on painful conditions, like chronic back pain and migraines. Researchers speculate that it may help ease pain by altering signals among nerve cells or affecting the release of various chemicals of the central nervous system.

It is unclear, Manber said, why acupuncture might help lessen the severity of depression.

For their study, she and her colleagues randomly assigned 52 women to receive depression-specific acupuncture twice a week for four weeks, then weekly for another four weeks. Another 49 women received control acupuncture and 49 received massage. All completed a standard measure of depression severity at the outset and again after four and eight weeks of treatment.

After eight weeks, patients in the depression-specific acupuncture group had a higher rate of response to treatment. They were not, however, more likely to see a complete remission in their depression; about 35 percent had a remission, versus 29.5 percent in the other two groups combined - a statistically insignificant difference.

Fourteen women who received depression-specific acupuncture reported pain during the needling, as did seven in the control-acupuncture group.

Overall, Manber’s team notes, the response to acupuncture in this study was comparable to what has been seen in studies of psychotherapy for depression during pregnancy.

"Feb. 22, 2010 -- Acupuncture may be an effective way to reduce depression during pregnancy, a new study shows.

Many pregnant women who have symptoms of depression worry that taking antidepressants might harm their unborn babies -- so they stop taking their medications, say researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine.

Acupuncture might be a useful alternative, they say, because a study of pregnant women shows that the procedure works in reducing depressive symptoms better than other non-pharmacological techniques.

The study included 150 pregnant women diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Some received depression-specific acupuncture treatments, others had needles inserted in acupuncture points not known to relieve depression, and a third group received massage therapy.

All of the women received therapy for eight weeks and were interviewed at the four- and eight-week marks by someone who did not know which treatment they were getting.

The researchers say 63% of the women who received depression-specific acupuncture reported a significant reduction in symptoms, compared to 44% of women in the other two groups combined. Remission rates were not significantly lower in the depression-specific acupuncture group compared to the other two groups.

""I hope that people will respect the rigorous methodology used in this blinded, randomized, controlled trial and accept the result,"" study researcher Deirdre Lyell, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University School of Medicine, says in a news release.

Given that so many depressed women are reluctant to take antidepressants during pregnancy, ""it's important to find an alternative,"" study researcher Rachel Manber, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford, says in the news release.

Lyell says treatment of depression during pregnancy ""is critically important so that a woman can maintain her sense of well-being and take good care of herself, her fetus, and someday, her child.""

The researchers say up to 14% of pregnant women may suffer from depression.

The study is published in the March issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.",0

WEDNESDAY, Feb. 17, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Regular use of ibuprofen, a common anti-inflammatory drug, significantly lowers the risk for developing Parkinson's disease, Harvard researchers report.

People who took three or more tablets a week showed a 40 percent lower risk than those who didn't take the common pain reliever, their study found.

Study author Dr. Xiang Gao, an instructor and epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the findings are important for anyone at increased risk for Parkinson's because most people with the disease eventually become severely disabled.

""There is thus a need for better preventive interventions,"" Gao said. ""In this context, our findings regarding the potential neuroprotective effect of ibuprofen, one of the most commonly used analgesics, on Parkinson's disease may have important public health and clinical implications.""

Parkinson's is a disease that affects nerve cells in the brain that control the movement of muscles. It affects an estimated 1 million people in the United States, men far more often than women. The exact cause is unknown, but experts believe it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Gao said that though the drug levodopa is the current standard treatment for Parkinson's, much more is needed. He is scheduled to present the findings in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April.

The findings came from an analysis of data on 136,474 people who did not have Parkinson's at the start of the study. In a six-year span, 293 were diagnosed with the disease. Those who took the largest doses of ibuprofen were less likely to have developed Parkinson's than were those who took smaller amounts of the drug, the study found.

No other pain reliever was found to lower the risk for Parkinson's.

Dr. Michele Tagliati, an associate professor of neurology and director of the Parkinson's Disease Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, described the results as somewhat surprising and said they emphasized the need for further study.

""It's intriguing [that the finding applied to] just ibuprofen and not aspirin or acetaminophen or other commonly prescribed medications for inflammation because it implies something more specific to ibuprofen that should be investigated,"" Tagliati said. ""So it narrows the focus to a subgroup of [anti-inflammatory drugs].""

Tagliati called the study ""eye-opening."" Parkinson's is not considered an inflammatory disease, he said, adding: ""We might be missing something. There is more work to be done.""

But in the meantime, Tagliati said, he would ""definitely discuss ibuprofen use"" with his patients because, if it works to protect against the disease, it could very well benefit those who already have it.

He cautioned that persistent use of ibuprofen can lead to gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach lining, but said that, in comparison, ""there is very little to lose when measuring its side effects against the effects of Parkinson's,"" which can include loss of balance, stiffness, hallucinations and dementia.

"A nasal spray containing a hormone that is known to make women more maternal and men less shy apparently can help those with autism make eye contact and interact better with others, according to a provocative study released Monday.

The study, involving 13 adults with either a high-functioning form of autism or Asperger syndrome, a mild form of the disorder, found that when the subjects inhaled the hormone oxytocin, they scored significantly better on a test that involved recognizing faces and performed much better in a game that involved tossing a ball with others.

Although more research is needed to confirm and explore the findings, the results are the latest in a growing body of evidence indicating that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain disorder function better.

""This is the first study that looked at whether oxytocin has an effect on social behavior, which is a major deficit in autism,"" said Angela Sirigu, who directs the National Center for Scientific Research in France and led the study, published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""It looks like it could be very helpful.""

Researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work, saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism.

""I think it's going to be a very exciting finding for a lot of people,"" said Alex Martin, chief of cognitive neuropsychology at the National Institute of Mental Health.

Because oxytocin does not last long in the body and produces its effects for a relatively brief period, some experts said the findings were more likely to encourage drug companies to develop alternative substances that had the same benefits.

""This paper suggests that's worth doing,"" said Thomas R. Insel, director of the institute. ""It adds another brick in the wall that suggests there may be an opportunity to develop treatment for one of the core symptoms of autism. That's been the brass ring.""

But Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said.

""It's possible it can become a cure, if it's given early when the problems are detected in the little kids,"" Sirigu said. ""We can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood.""

Because previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin, conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well, said Karen Parker, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine.

""If you can find someone who appears to have deficits in oxytocin biology, giving them what you might argue would be replacement oxytocin may be helpful,"" Parker said.

Autism is a baffling disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including speech and learning problems and profound, disabling difficulties understanding emotions and social cues when interacting with people. The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious.

Oxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people.

Previous U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions.

""All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,"" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York.

While cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings. Oxytocin has been in use for several years as an ""alternative"" therapy for autism.

""Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement,"" said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association. ""Getting double-blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports.""

""We need to be mindful of the fact that the majority of human studies of oxytocin have been conducted using adults, including this study, and only one paper has included individuals between the ages of 12 and 18. We have to be careful about the safety and efficacy of oxytocin on pediatric populations,"" said Clara Lajonchere, vice president of clinical programs for Autism Speaks.",1

THURSDAY, Feb. 11, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Just in time for Valentine's Day comes word that eating dark chocolate appears to lower your risk of stroke or lessen the likelihood of death after a stroke.

But the findings, based on a review of existing research, aren't conclusive, and they don't prove that chocolate is good for your heart. And dietitians say too much chocolate can be harmful.

Still, two of the three studies analyzed in the review provide yet another suggestion that health benefits lurk in chocolate, dark chocolate in particular, said review co-author Dr. Gustavo Saposnik.

If choosing among white chocolate, milk chocolate or dark chocolate, ""I'd definitely go with the dark chocolate,"" said Saposnik, director of the Stroke Research Unit at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto.

The review authors, who found three studies on chocolate consumption and stroke between 2001 and 2009, are scheduled to report their findings at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Toronto in April.

One study found no significant association between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke or death from stroke. But another found that the stroke rate was 22 percent lower in people who ate chocolate once a week, and a third reported that death from stroke was 46 percent lower in those who ate 50 grams of chocolate once a week.

The health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate, Saposnik said. Antioxidants are thought to prevent cell damage.

In years past, ""the message was that chocolate consumption might be associated with higher LDL [bad] cholesterol or perhaps higher incidence of cardiovascular disease,"" he said. ""Today, we know that all chocolates are not the same.""

So, should you and your sweetheart add dark chocolate to your diet? ""I'm not sure we can provide any recommendation at this time,"" Saposnik said.

For one thing, it's possible that some factor other than chocolate could be helping lower the risk of stroke. Those who eat more chocolate could be wealthier and have better access to health care, for instance, or go to the gym more often.

Saposnik said more studies will help clarify the association between chocolate and stroke risk.

For now, said registered dietitian Katie Clark, ""caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food,"" even though it's fine in moderation.

Chocolate is a major source of saturated fat, which raises bad cholesterol and boosts heart disease risk, said Clark, an assistant clinical professor at the University of California at San Francisco.

But Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City who studies nutrition, said chocolate does have its benefits. ""Several studies indicate that even a little chocolate can help reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow through the arteries. Both are good for heart health,"" he said. ""It's nice to know that chocolate isn't bad for you, assuming you eat modest amounts and don't become overweight by overeating it.""

"Feb. 9, 2010 -- Pregnant women who drink plenty of milk may be protecting their child from developing multiple sclerosis (MS) in the future.

MS is a nervous system disease that attacks the material, called myelin, that covers nerve fibers. This disrupts signaling between nerves and causes nerve damage, leading to symptoms such as numbness, tingling, fatigue, loss of vision, and possibly, paralysis. The disease most often strikes adults after age 20, but it can develop in children.

Growing evidence has suggested that vitamin D, found in fortified milk, may lower one’s risk of MS. Now, researchers with the Harvard School of Public Health in Boston have shown that it’s possible this protective benefit could begin while a baby is developing in the womb.

The study involved more than 35,000 female nurses whose mothers answered questions about their diet habits during pregnancy. It revealed that women born to mothers who had the highest intake of vitamin D had a much lower risk of developing MS as an adult. Among the nurses studied, 199 developed MS over the 16-year study period.

""The risk of MS among daughters whose mothers consumed four glasses of milk per day was 56% lower than daughters whose mothers consumed less than three glasses of milk per month,"" Harvard researcher Fariba Mirzaei, MD, says in a news release.

""We also found the risk of MS among daughters whose mothers were in the top 20% of vitamin D intake during pregnancy was 45% lower than daughters whose mothers were in the bottom 20% for vitamin D intake during pregnancy.""

Vitamin D is found in certain foods and beverages such as fortified milk and cereals, and fatty fish such as salmon. However, few foods naturally contain the vitamin. Your body also makes vitamin D after the skin absorbs some of the sun’s rays. Sunlight is one of the most important sources of vitamin D.

Researchers will present their findings in April at the American Academy of Neurology's 62nd Annual Meeting in Toronto.",1
"(CNN) -- Eating a diet rich in healthy fats and limiting dairy and meat could do more than keep your heart healthier. It could also help keep you thinking clearly.

New research shows that sticking to the Mediterranean diet, previously shown to reduce heart and other health issues, also may help lower the risk of having small areas of dead tissue linked to thinking problems. Known as brain infarcts, they're involved in vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease.

""We've got these diseases of aging that cause disability, cost a ton of money to treat and manage, and wreck people's lives,"" said Dr. Gregory Cole, a professor of medicine and neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in this new study. ""You've got to get in there and figure out what actually works for prevention, and not have people guessing.""

A Mediterranean diet includes a lot of fruit, vegetables and fish, olive oil, legumes and cereals, and fewer dishes containing dairy, meat, poultry, and saturated fatty acids than other diets. It also involves small to moderate amounts of alcohol.

The study relates diet to strokes, said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center and lead author of the study. The research will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April.

An infarct, a kind of stroke, happens when the passage of blood is slowed or completely blocked by clotting. This study looked at people who had never had a clinical stroke, but may have had smaller strokes that went unnoticed. An MRI brain scan can detect these small strokes.

The study looked at 712 people over the age of 65 living in New York. Participants were asked about their diet and then, about six years later, underwent an MRI. In general, dietary patterns are consistent for at least seven or eight years, Scarmeas said.

Researchers found that people who most closely followed a Mediterranean-like diet were 36 percent less likely to have areas of brain damage, compared with those whose eating habits were furthest from the diet.

The study shows association, not causation, meaning there could be some other factors linking the Mediterranean diet to resilience against this form of brain damage. For example, other research has found that higher adherence to the diet seems to protect against hypertension, also associated with these brain problems.

But in this new research, when the scientists controlled for hypertension, the diet was still linked to a lower risk of brain damage. It is possible that the diet protects the brain vessels themselves, irrespective of other problems such as high blood pressure, Scarmeas said.

The participants who followed the Mediterranean diet the least had an increased risk for having strokes that was similar to people with hypertension. Those who most strongly adhered to the dietary regimen had a level of protection similar to people who did not have hypertension.

Scarmeas' previous research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Looking at 2,250 individuals from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, researchers found a 40 percent lower risk among those who stuck to this diet, scientists reported in the Annals of Neurology in 2006. The people involved in the brain infarcts study are a subset of that original group.

As many as 2.4 million to 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Between 1 and 4 percent of people over the age of 65 have vascular dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic.

Other studies have suggested that this food regimen may help in preventing second heart attacks, lowering cancer risk and stopping the need for diabetes drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes.

The new study ""gives you better evidence than ever that this is actually protective, and protective against the development of dementia,"" Cole said.

The risk factors for vascular disease overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease, he said. These include high blood pressure, high-fat diets, type 2 diabetes and low folate intake. People who have both Alzheimer's and vascular disease -- a condition called mixed dementia -- have a more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, Cole said.

A subsequent issue to address is whether a person must follow the entire Mediterranean diet in order to reap these benefits, or whether there are portions of it that contribute positive effects, Cole said. It would be easier for people to focus on adding particular elements to their diets -- for example, by taking fish oil capsules -- rather than trying to readjust their eating habits altogether.

Cole's own research deals with fish oil, which is relevant because fish is a component in the Mediterranean diet. The bottom line for dementia is that fish oil may help in the very early stages, but more research must be done to confirm this, he said.

In a study, his group found that DHA fatty acids from fish oil could delay or deter the onset of Alzheimer's disease in rats or older mice that had been genetically altered to develop the condition. Also, a recent study found that the DHA component of fish oil from algae helped people with minor memory impairment, but this needs to be replicated in order to be more definitive, he said.

When Scarmeas' group looked at the individual components of the diet, they found a stronger association between the overall diet and brain damage prevention than with any individual food in the diet, suggesting that the combination all of the elements may be producing the effect, Scarmeas said.

Researchers will continue to follow the participants in the study and check in on them every year and a half, Scarmeas said.

The next step would be to have controlled experiments concerning food and dementia in which participants are randomly assigned to follow a diet, Cole said. It is complicated in general to compare the benefits of a particular diet with the benefits of not following a different food regimen.",1
"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have used an “artificial pancreas” system of pumps and monitors to improve blood sugar control in diabetes patients in the first study to show the new device works better than conventional treatment.

Researchers from Britain’s Cambridge University tested the device on 17 children with type 1 diabetes during a series of nights in hospital and found it kept their blood sugar levels within the important “normal” range for 60 percent of the time.

The new system, which involves patients wearing a matchbox-sized monitor and a similar-sized pump with a tube to deliver insulin into the body, also halved the amount of time blood sugar dropped to worrying or dangerous levels, they said.

Medical device makers have been working for years to develop a so-called artificial pancreas to deliver insulin to patients with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease in which the body destroys its own ability to make insulin.

The bodies of type 1 diabetes sufferers become unable to properly break down sugar and if untreated, blood vessels and nerves are destroyed, organs fail and patients die.

“These devices could transform the management of type 1 diabetes, but it is likely to be a gradual process,” Roman Hovorka of Cambridge, who led the research, said in a telephone interview.

He said the results were “an important stepping stone” toward bringing an artificial pancreas to the commercial market, but predicted several years yet of refinement before it could be used day and night by patients in normal life.

“It’s a bit like with mobile phones. When we started, the technology wasn’t very good and the functionality was limited, and it took a number of generations to move to the device that we have now. I see the same thing with this system.”

The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said last month it was teaming up with U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson’s unit Animas, which makes insulin pumps, and DexCom Inc, which makes continuous glucose monitoring devices, to develop and test an artificial pancreas system.

The Cambridge study, published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday, used devices and sensors from Smiths Medical, a unit of Smiths Group, Abbott Diabetes Care, a unit of Abbott Laboratories, and Medtronic.

The ultimate goal is to create a device that can check patients blood day and night, during and between meals, and deliver insulin as required.

The Cambridge study found their device performed better than a conventional pump, which delivers insulin at pre-set rates and which kept blood sugar levels around normal for 40 percent of the time compared with 60 percent for the artificial pancreas.

Hovorka said the findings were particularly encouraging because the study included nights when the children went to bed after eating a large evening meal or having done exercise — both of which can affect blood sugar levels.",0
"Feb. 4, 2010 - It has been called the Holy Grail of treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes, and it may be close to reality.

For decades, researchers have searched unsuccessfully for ways to automatically coordinate insulin delivery with real-time changes in blood sugar to essentially create an artificial pancreas that maintains target blood sugar levels with minimal effort.

Now new technology is making this possible, and new research shows that an experimental system can improve nighttime blood sugar control.

Using sophisticated computer software, researchers were able to coordinate the actions of a commercially available continuous glucose monitoring device and insulin pump to allow automatic insulin delivery in response to real-time glucose readings.

The system proved better than a conventional insulin pump for maintaining optimal blood sugar levels during the night in a study from the U.K.'s University of Cambridge.

Aaron J. Kowalski, PhD, of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which was involved in funding the research, says the study represents an important step forward in the search for a clinically feasible artificial pancreas to improve outcomes and quality of life among insulin-dependent diabetes patients.

""This is hugely promising and very significant research,"" he tells WebMD. ""Nighttime is the time of day that strikes fear into patients and parents of children with diabetes.""",1

TUESDAY, Feb. 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) --When a doctor wants to assess the condition of heart arteries without putting a gadget into those blood vessels, the X-ray technology called computed tomography -- more commonly called a CT scan -- is better than magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, a German review of studies has found.

""For ruling out coronary artery disease, CT is more accurate than MRI,"" researchers from Humboldt University in Berlin said in a report in the Feb. 2 issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.

The standard method for checking heart arteries is coronary angiography, which involves threading a thin, flexible tube, called a catheter, into the heart. But doctors do not always want to run the risks that can be associated with that technique, and the leading candidates for less invasive assessment are CT and MRI.

CT is a scanning technique using X-rays that produce a set of slice-by-slice heart images, up to 16 slices, depending on the power of the machine. MRI uses a powerful magnetic field and pulses of radiowave energy to create images.

The German researchers looked at results of 109 published studies of noninvasive heart artery imaging, including 89 that used CT and 20 that used MRI and involving 8,505 people. In the studies of people with suspected coronary artery disease, CT proved to be 97 percent sensitive, compared with 87 percent sensitivity for MRI exams, the analysis found. Sensitivity rates the ability of a test to correctly identify people who have a particular disease.

""This article holds no surprises whatever,"" said Dr. Uwe Joseph Schoepf, a professor of radiology and cardiology at the Medical University of South Carolina. ""This is really something that is sort of common trade knowledge.""

Indeed, CT and MRI are not contenders in clinical practice but are used for different reasons to make different assessments, Schoepf said. ""It is a question of what specific question you are looking to answer,"" he said.

CT is the preferred noninvasive technology for assessing the condition of heart arteries, whether there is narrowing that might end with the total blockage that causes a heart attack, Schoepf said. ""MRI is not in current use to look at coronary artery disease,"" he said. ""We use MRI angiography if we are interested in heart muscle, as when there are congenital heart abnormalities in children. The strength of MRI is that it shows tissue configuration.""

That difference helps explain why there are so few studies doing head-to-head comparison of CT versus MRI, he said. The German analysis found only five such studies.

Dr. Ricardo Cury, director of cardiac MRI and CT at Baptist Cardiac & Vascular Institute in Miami and a consultant radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, said that the ""meta-analysis demonstrates a knowledge that we have accumulated for the past several years.""

""For imaging of the cardiac arteries, CT is more robust,"" Cury said. ""We perform MRI on a clinical basis more for functional assessment, as opposed to looking at the coronary arteries.""

Though that difference is well established among radiologists, the new study may be of assistance in the general medical community, including general cardiologists, because ""it summarizes the advantages of CT at this point in time,"" he said.

Indeed, CT appears to be better for assessment of coronary artery disease, matched against not only MRI but other methods, such as echocardiography, he said.

"Jan. 28, 2010 - Elevated levels of inflammatory proteins called cytokines and related factors in the blood may be an early warning sign of impending rheumatoid arthritis (RA), according to a new study.

Researchers have found that levels of certain cytokines and related factors in the blood increase significantly prior to the development of rheumatoid arthritis, long before symptoms emerge. They say the finding paves the way for developing a blood test for early diagnosis of the mysterious disease.

""Our findings present an opportunity for better predicting the risk of developing RA and possibly preventing disease progression,"" says researcher Solbritt Rantapää-Dahlqvist, MD, of University Hospital in Umea, Sweden, in a news release.

Rheumatoid arthritis is a painful, progressive condition that can be difficult to diagnose in the early stages because it often begins with only subtle symptoms, such as achy joints or early morning stiffness. Other conditions, such as lupus, osteoarthritis, and fibromyalgia may also mimic the early symptoms of rheumatoid arthritis, which makes a definitive diagnosis difficult.

But studies have shown that early diagnosis and treatment of rheumatoid arthritis can help sufferers live a more active life and potentially avoid the type of joint damage that leads to disability.",0

WEDNESDAY, Jan. 27 (HealthDay News) -- A new imaging technology promises to achieve the long-sought goal of singling out prostate cancers that are life-threatening and require the most aggressive treatment, researchers report.

Magnetic resonance spectroscopy, which provides information about the metabolic chemistry of suspected cancerous tissue, gave good results in a small trial in which its readings were compared with those of current measures of prostate cancer danger, according to a report published Jan. 27 in Science Translational Medicine.

""We see a good correlation with pathology defined by those methods,"" said Leo L. Cheng, an assistant professor of radiology and pathology at Harvard Medical School and a researcher at Massachusetts General Hospital.

Prostate cancers are common among older men, but most of them are so slow-growing that they pose no danger to life. Current diagnostic techniques, which include readings of blood levels of a protein, prostate-specific antigen, cannot pick out the dangerous tumors. Doctors can take a tissue sample by doing a biopsy, but they often miss the small but deadly portion of the cancer that is growing aggressively enough to be life-threatening.

In 2005, Cheng and his colleagues found that magnetic resonance spectroscopy could distinguish cancerous from normal prostate tissue by their metabolic profiles. That's because cancerous tissue produces different chemicals than normal tissue.

Their new study used magnetic resonance spectroscopy on five cancerous prostate glands removed from men with the diagnosis. The results of the scans were compared with those of the standard technique, which judges a cancer by the degree of disorder produced by the malignancy. Five of seven regions identified as cancerous by that method scored high on a magnetic resonance spectroscopy malignancy index. The other two regions were near the outer edges of the glands, where exposure to air made the magnetic resonance results less clear.

The same kind of analysis can be done without removing the prostate glands, so Cheng and his colleagues are moving toward a trial that would more resemble the work now done by doctors.

""We are doing a validation study,"" Cheng said. ""Once these data are verified, we need to work with the electronics people to develop more sensitive probes. Once that part is overcome, everything can be applied.""

The validation study will take ""optimistically, one to three months,"" Cheng said. Getting data showing that the technology can be used in human patients ""will take some time, a year or two,"" he said.

When and if it comes to human trials, ""the most urgent issue is to guide biopsies,"" Cheng said. ""By taking a chemical spectrum of tissue, we may be able to do better than pathology to tell how aggressive a tumor is.""

The technology currently requires a magnetic field far more powerful than those in magnetic resonance imaging devices in current medical use, and so part of the program at Massachusetts General Hospital is an effort to make the method usable in less powerful devices, he said.

Cheng's program is one of a number of efforts aimed at applying magnetic resonance imaging to prostate cancer diagnosis. Another already is available commercially, marketed by iCAD Inc., a New Hampshire-based company.

The iCAD technology uses ""dynamic contrast-enhanced"" imaging, said Marc Filerman, vice president of global marketing for the company. Gadolinium, a contrast agent, is injected into the prostate gland ""to produce images that better highlight where the potentially cancerous lesion might be,"" he said.

Gadolinium concentrates in regions where there are fast-growing blood vessels that the voracious expansion of cancerous tissue requires, he said. ""Those blood vessels are leaky, and the resulting images enable us to quantify a potentially cancerous lesion, to see the effect of treatment,"" Filerman said.

Work to improve existing technologies is continuing, he said. ""What we are trying to do in the magnetic resonance imaging community is to standardize on the best methodology for image acquisition and interpretation,"" Filerman explained.

MONDAY, Jan. 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A low-carbohydrate diet helps people shed as many pounds as a low-fat diet plus the weight-loss drug orlistat does, and the low-carb plan may be better at helping lower blood pressure, researchers report.

Their study, published in the Jan. 25 issue of the Archives of Internal Medicine, found that both diets helped participants lose almost 10 percent of their body weight.

""Weight loss was similar but substantial in both groups we studied, but blood pressure improved more in the low-carb dieters,"" said study author Dr. William Yancy Jr., an associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center and a staff physician at the Department of Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Durham, N.C.

""There are options out there. Pick a diet you think you could stick to better, and work with your physician to help you target the right intervention for you,"" he advised. Two other studies in the same issue of the journal look at the effectiveness of the anti-hypertension DASH diet and a physician-supervised plan.

Obesity is a significant contributor to many illnesses, including heart disease, stroke, diabetes and many cancers, according to an editorial in the same journal by Dr. Robert Kushner of Northwestern University's Feinberg School of Medicine. More than one-third of American adults are obese, and the incidence of obesity has gone up 140 percent over the past decade, Kushner notes.

Yancy's study included 146 overweight or obese adults who were randomly assigned to a low-carbohydrate diet or orlistat with a low-fat diet. The average age of the study participants was 52 and the average body-mass index was 39 (30 and over is considered obese). Orlistat is marketed as Xenical, a prescription medication, and Alli, available over the counter.

The low-carb diet began with a carbohydrate intake of less than 20 grams of carbohydrates a day. The group taking orlistat received a 120-milligram dose of the drug three times daily and got less than 30 percent of their calories from fat.

Over 48 weeks, the low-carbohydrate group lost 9.5 percent of their body weight, while the orlistat group lost 8.5 percent. ""Good"" cholesterol (HDL) and triglyceride levels improved in both groups. LDL, or ""bad"" cholesterol, was only reduced in the orlistat group. Insulin and glucose markers improved only in the low-carb group, and there was a significant drop in blood pressure in the low-carb group compared to the orlistat group -- systolic blood pressure (the top number) dropped by 5.9 mm Hg on the low-carb diet vs. 1.5 mm Hg for the orlistat group. Similar reductions were seen for diastolic blood pressure.

Yancy said the blood pressure and cholesterol drops might have been even more impressive if people had stayed on their medications, but as they lost weight and normalized these readings, the doctors took them off blood-pressure and cholesterol drugs.

Two other studies in the same issue of the journal looked at the effects of the DASH diet and a physician-supervised plan.

Researchers compared the DASH (Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension) diet alone and in combination with exercise and weight management on blood pressure. The researchers found that combining the DASH diet with weight management and exercise resulted in a 16.1 mm Hg drop in systolic blood pressure compared to 11.2 mm Hg on the DASH diet alone. Additionally, those in the exercise, weight management and DASH plan lost an average of 19 pounds over four months vs. less than one pound for the DASH diet alone.

The third study compared an Internet weight-management program with a physician-managed program for extremely obese people that included a liquid diet component, followed by a structured diet, behavioral counseling and diet medications. The more intensive intervention was more successful with 31 percent losing more than 5 percent of their body weight, compared to just 9 percent of the Internet group.

""There are many paths to weight loss,"" said registered dietitian Karen Congro, director of the Wellness for Life Program at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York City. What often makes the difference in whether or not a diet is successful, she said, is whether or not there's a counseling and support component to the plan.

And, she said, these studies show that you don't necessarily need to get to your ""ideal body weight"" to make substantial improvements to your health. Losing 5 percent to 10 percent of your body weight can make positive changes in blood pressure, cholesterol and glucose control.

""If it can make you a healthier person, then a diet is a success,"" said Congro.

"Jan. 25, 2010 -- A low-carbohydrate diet may have health benefits that go beyond weight loss.

A new study shows that a low-carbohydrate diet was equally good as the weight loss drug orlistat (the active ingredient in Alli and Xenical) at helping overweight and obese people lose weight, but people who followed the low-carb diet also experienced a healthy drop in their blood pressure levels.

""I expected the weight loss to be considerable with both therapies but we were surprised to see blood pressure improve so much more with the low-carbohydrate diet than with orlistat,"" researcher William S. Yancy, Jr., MD, an associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, says in a news release. ""If people have high blood pressure and a weight problem, a low-carbohydrate diet might be a better option than a weight loss medication.""

Researchers say studies have already shown that the two weight loss methods are effective at promoting weight loss, but it's the first time the health effects of each have been compared head to head.

""It's important to know you can try a diet instead of medication and get the same weight loss results with fewer costs and potentially fewer side effects,"" Yancy says.",1

SUNDAY, Jan. 17, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Giving a vaccine through a scratch on the skin (scarification) triggers a stronger immune response than injected vaccines, say U.S. researchers, who also found that scarification requires 100 times less vaccine to prompt an immune response.

Scarification was first used nearly two centuries ago to give the first smallpox vaccinations. Nearly all modern vaccines are given via injection, according to background information in a news release about the study, which is published in the Jan. 17 issue of Nature Medicine.

In a series of tests, the Brigham and Women's Hospital researchers also found that the memory of T-cells -- the cells that mount an immune response against invading viruses -- may be more important than the antibodies generated by injected vaccines. T-cells are located in lymph nodes and blood, as well as in peripheral tissues such as skin and lung.

""This research illustrates the remarkable capacity of the most superficial layer of skin to generate powerful protective immune responses after vaccination,"" study senior researcher Dr. Thomas Kupper, chairman of the dermatology department at the hospital, said in a news release from the hospital.

""The ability of vaccination through injured epidermis -- or scarification -- to generate such powerful tissue-resident protective T-cells is a completely novel observation that should make us reconsider the way we think about vaccine delivery for all infectious diseases, as well as cancer. After all, our immune system evolved over millions of years to respond to infections of injured skin, not vaccines delivered by hypodermic syringe into muscle,"" he noted.

In their experiments, Kupper and colleagues found that scarification with the vaccinia virus offered much greater protection against smallpox than injecting the vaccine. They also found that a melanoma vaccine delivered by scarification was much more effective than injected vaccines in protecting animals against melanoma tumor growth.

""The lessons we are learning from these studies of vaccination by scarification could help us develop new and more powerful vaccines for influenza, HIV, malaria and other infectious diseases,"" Kupper explained. ""We should also continue to explore the implications for developing powerful cancer vaccines, like the one demonstrated by melanoma vaccine results in this study.""

"The bodies of many older Americans are practically bionic: more than 770,000 hip and knee replacements are performed each year in the United States.

Now another aging joint is fast becoming a candidate for replacement. This year, 4,400 patients are expected to undergo surgery to replace arthritic or injured ankles with artificial joints made of metal alloys and lightweight plastic, according to industry estimates.

Four models are commonly used in the United States, with Food and Drug Administration approval. And demand is expected to grow as more and more baby boomers hobble into their 60s and 70s with debilitating ankle pain.

Ankle replacement has been around for three decades, but it has been slow to catch on. Problems with early devices left surgeons and patients wary. The operation is complex, and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience. While Medicare pays for ankle replacement, many private insurers do not.

Each year about two million Americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture. An estimated 50,000 people a year experience end-stage ankle arthritis, in which the ankle cartilage has worn away completely, causing painful bone-on-bone contact and some level of disability.

Until lately, such patients have had only one surgical option: ankle fusion surgery, in which the worn-out part of the joint is removed and the bones are permanently locked together with screws and plates. The procedure usually relieves pain, but the patient loses mobility in the ankle, leading to changes in gait and, ultimately, additional wear and tear and arthritic pain in other parts of the ankle. About 25,000 ankle fusions were performed in the United States last year.

Andrew Keaveney, now 73, shattered his ankle in a fall from a truck while hanging flags as an American Legion volunteer. Surgery repaired the broken bones, but he continued to have severe pain.

Doctors suggested ankle fusion, but he found a surgeon who offered total ankle replacement. He had the operation in December 2008, and now he says the ankle is “99 percent.”

“Before the surgery, I couldn’t sleep at night,” said Mr. Keaveney, of Locust Valley, N.Y. “Now I’m able to climb ladders. I have absolutely no pain. I was even playing soccer with my grandkids a few months ago.”

His surgeon, Dr. Craig S. Radnay, an associate at the Insall Scott Kelly Institute for Orthopedics and Sports Medicine in New York City and on Long Island, says he is now a “big believer” in ankle replacement for certain patients.

“For an ankle replacement you have to be a little more picky in who you select for those cases,” he said. “But I can’t tell you how many patients come in, and I mention this option they don’t even know exists.” (Dr. Radnay, who says he has performed more than 100 ankle replacements using an Inbone device from Wright Medical Group of Arlington, Tenn., is now a paid consultant to the company, helping to gather data on long-term success rates.)

The ideal patient is around 60 years old and of normal weight, although doctors consider older patients, depending on their health. People with diabetes may not be good candidates because they may risk complications as a result of poor blood circulation.

Dr. Jonathan T. Deland, chief of the foot and ankle service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in Manhattan, said that while the devices had improved, he remained cautious about offering the operation. (Dr. Deland is helping to develop a new ankle replacement device for Zimmer of Warsaw, Ind., which may be submitted for F.D.A. approval this year.)

“The big concern about ankle replacement is how often do they fail and how often do they loosen,” he said.

Complications can include slow healing, as well as infection. Severe complications are rare, but they can result in amputation. Still, Dr. Deland said, “we’re getting fewer and fewer failures.”

The new models require that less bone be removed, so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger. In addition, instruments used to guide surgeons in aligning the artificial joint have improved. Dr. Deland cited data showing that for some recent models, 90 percent of ankle replacements were still in place after an average of eight and a half years.

Though the four devices in common use have technical differences in design and in how they are implanted, doctors say the choice of device matters far less than the experience of the surgeon. The procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform, and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint.

Dr. Brian Donley, an orthopedic surgeon who is director of the foot and ankle center at the Cleveland Clinic, says patients should always ask their doctor to disclose any financial interest in a device. (He performed the first United States operation using the Salto Talaris device from Tornier of Minneapolis, and receives consulting fees from the company.)

Even with a successful implantation, patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at 18. They should not try to return to activities like basketball and distance running. But golf and walking, and sometimes even skiing, are typically allowed.

“My happiest patients I have in my practice are my ankle replacement patients,” Dr. Donley said. “They are so appreciative about how their life has been changed. They can go to their grandchild’s wedding and get up and have a dance.”",1

MONDAY, Jan. 11, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- As a major organization of pediatricians considers revising its recommendations on circumcision of newborn boys, two new reviews of existing research offer conflicting conclusions about the bitterly debated procedure.

One review, from Australia, says there's no evidence that infant circumcision will reduce the risk of sexually transmitted disease later in life, and it warns of significant psychological harm. But another from the United States gives more weight to findings from Africa that show the procedure, when it's performed on adult men, makes a major difference in preventing such diseases as AIDS.

The findings come as the American Academy of Pediatrics debates updating its recommendations regarding circumcision among newborns. The academy now takes a neutral stance.

In general, ""there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the risks and benefits of circumcision,"" said Dr. Douglas S. Diekema, a pediatrician at the University of Washington who's familiar with both reviews and serves on a task force working on the academy's recommendations.

""There are some clear benefits to circumcision,"" he said. ""There are some risks to circumcision, although the significant ones appear to be rare.""

Not so, write the Australian researchers, who examined eight studies for a review in the latest issue of the Annals of Family Medicine. Two studies involved neonatal circumcision, and six involved older males, roughly 14 to 49 years old.

The review's lead author, researcher Caryn Perera of the Royal Australasian College of Surgeons, said the risk of major complications ranges from 2 percent to 10 percent. ""These may be considered unacceptable for an elective procedure,"" she said.

Parents who think circumcision has medical benefits should be aware that there's ""a lack of consensus and robust evidence"" on that, she added.

Though African studies have linked circumcision in adult men to lower rates of sexually transmitted diseases, including the virus that causes AIDS, Perera said that only future studies will tell if those findings are applicable to the Western world, where AIDS is much less prevalent.

And there's more to consider, Perera said. She said that circumcision poses problems from a mental point of view, potentially causing ""significant anger or feeling incomplete, hurt, frustrated, abnormal or violated.""

As to whether circumcision reduces sexual sensitivity, Perera said there's no evidence that it affects sensation when performed on adults. The highest-quality studies, known as randomized controlled trials, don't report whether infant circumcision affects sensation, she said.

A review in the January issue of Archives of Pediatrics & and Adolescent Medicine, which examined three studies, took a different tack. It says that risks of complications from circumcision are less than 1 percent, and ""serious long-term complications are extremely rare.""

Dr. Matthew Golden, an associate professor of medicine at the University of Washington Center for AIDS and STD, said the ideal study would randomly assign thousands of infants to either get circumcised or not get circumcised and then follow them for decades. But ""that trial is never getting done, nor should it be done,"" Golden said.

For now, he said, when it comes to circumcision, ""we know it's pretty safe, and we have a lot of evidence for some benefit.""

"Jan. 6, 2010 -- A new imaging technique that measures the random motion of water within the brain may prove useful for detecting early signs of Alzheimer's disease.

The technique, known as diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) or diffusion MRI, is used to assess changes in the white matter regions of the brain.

But it is increasingly clear that DTI can also be used to identify very small structural changes in the gray matter of the brain, which is critical for learning and memory, researcher Giovanni A. Carlesimo, MD, PhD, of Italy's Tor Vergata University tells WebMD.

In a study published in the Jan. 19 issue of Neurology, Carlesimo and colleagues found that DTI scanning predicted declines in memory performance with more accuracy than traditional MRI.

""This type of brain scan appears to be a better way to measure how healthy the brain is in people who are experiencing memory loss,"" Carlesimo says in a news release. ""This might help doctors when trying to differentiate between normal aging and diseases like Alzheimer's.""",1
"BOSTON (Reuters) - If you’re checking into the hospital for surgery, doctors may soon be swabbing your nose in an effort to prevent an infection from appearing after your operation.

Researchers in the Netherlands said on Wednesday they were able to cut the risk of a common bacterium by nearly 60 percent by first looking for signs of it in the nose and then treating it with an antibiotic nasal gel and full body wash.

The treatment combination also shaved two days off a typical 14-day stay in the hospital.

Hospital-acquired infections are a major problem in medicine, so doctors are always looking for the best way to reduce the risk.

About 27 million surgeries are done just in the United States each year, and in as many as half a million cases, infections occur at the site of surgery.

Up to 30 percent of those infections are caused by strains of the bacterium Staphylococcus aureus, which otherwise benignly resides in the nose and on the skin.

The new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, used a rapid test to identify which patients, most of whom were scheduled to undergo surgery, had the bacteria in at least one nostril.

The 504 patients treated with the antibiotic nose gel mupirocin, also known as Bactroban, and washed with chlorhexidine, a common ingredient in mouthwash, developed an S. aureus infection 3.4 percent of the time. The rate for 413 volunteers given placebo treatment was 7.7 percent.

The research team, led by Dr. Lonneke Bode of Erasmus University Medical Center in Rotterdam, estimated that 250 patients would need to be screened to prevent one infection.

“Preventing one infection will pay for thousands of these screenings,” Dr. Henri Verbrugh of Erasmus, a coauthor of the study, said in a telephone interview.

Infections are also a problem when doctors put tubes into the body. Although his team did not evaluate enough patients to study the problem directly, “We feel this technology is capable of preventing those types of infections as well,” Verbrugh said.

A second infection study, also reported in the journal, found that a chlorhexidine-alcohol combination produced 41 percent fewer surgical-site infections as the commonly used mixture of povidone and iodine, which gives a yellow-orange tinge to the skin.

In a commentary, Dr. Richard Wenzel of the Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond said the chlorhexidine-alcohol mixture should replace the older disinfectant when scrubbing people for surgery, and the nasal disinfection technique should primarily be used for people undergoing cardiac surgery, receiving an implant, or whose immune system is likely to be affected.",1

FRIDAY, Jan. 1, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Three-quarters of patients undergoing surgery for stubborn sinusitis saw significant improvements in their quality of life, new research shows.

Most of the remaining 25 percent also saw some improvement, just not as dramatic, said Dr. Timothy Smith, lead author of a study appearing in the January issue of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery.

""Certainly this reinforces our belief that sinus surgery increases the quality of life of patients, and I see that clinically as well as scientifically,"" added Dr. Jordan S. Josephson, a sinus and allergy specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Previous studies have been single-center studies, and this is a bigger study using multiple centers and using a fairly large population, so it further says sinus surgery is a really good thing to do if you need it.""

Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects a sizable minority -- 14 percent to 16 percent -- of U.S. residents. The condition, marked by symptoms such as sinus pain and pressure, headache, stuffy nose and sneezing, can compromise quality of life more than even congestive heart failure, back pain or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the study authors said.

Endoscopic sinus surgery has been performed in the United States since the mid-1980s, said Smith, who is director of the Oregon Sinus Center at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland.

""It's a minimally invasive type of surgery performed with a telescope that goes into the nostril,"" then basically snips away abnormal and interfering tissue while leaving normal tissue behind, Smith explained.

Smith and his co-authors studied 302 patients with CRS from three academic medical centers, following them for an average of a year and a half after their surgery.

""These were patients who have chronic sinusitis so, by definition, they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a CT scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses,"" Smith said.

Following the surgery, about 76 percent of patients had ""clinically significant"" improvement in quality of life, as measured by various validated scales.

Patients with worse disease at the outset seemed to fare the best after the procedure, as did those undergoing surgery for the first time. This second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with, Josephson said.

None of which is to say that patients shouldn't try medical therapies first, he added.

""I don't think it means everyone with CRS should consider surgery. They should try medical therapy, and if medical therapy fails and the surgeon feels that part of the problem is anatomic, then surgery would be a good tool for them to use,"" Josephson said. ""Some people with stage 1 and 2 diseases may even get cured. This is a wonderful renewed hope of feeling better.""

TUESDAY, Dec. 29, 2009 (HealthDay News) -- Many older adults consume ginkgo biloba, hoping to keep their minds sharp, but a new study finds that the herbal product doesn't stave off cognitive decline.

""Measuring the effect of ginkgo in a big trial in older people, we didn't see any effect of the drug on slowing down or delaying normal age-related changes of cognition,"" said lead researcher Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville.

""If you are older and thinking 'I'll try ginkgo to preserve brain health,' we have no evidence that it is useful,"" he said. ""I won't take it anymore.""

The report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies.

To test ginkgo's effect on cognitive decline, DeKosky's group looked at results from the ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, which included 3,069 community-dwelling adults 72 to 96 years of age. The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities.

Over more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly.

These results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted.

However, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. ""The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging.""

Earlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said.

The American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however.

""There are many significant limitations of this study,"" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement.

""First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition. Second, about 40 percent of the subjects dropped out over the six-year duration of the trial; the statistics reported in the study include the dropouts for which no final data are available,"" Blumenthal said. ""Further, the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began, creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not. Also, the age of the subjects is quite advanced, at an average of 79 years at the beginning of the trial. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance.""

Another group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), which represents the dietary supplement industry, also had reservations about the study.

In a statement, Douglas MacKay, CRN's vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, said that ""there is a large body of previously published evidence, as well as ongoing trials, which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults."" He added that, ""as a former practicing naturopathic doctor, I have had the benefit of working with patients and have seen firsthand how ginkgo biloba can be effective in improving cognitive function.""

Ginkgo biloba is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that protect cell membranes and help govern the workings of the brain's chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters.

Dr. Lon S. Schneider, director of the state of California's Alzheimer's Disease Research and Clinical Center at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said that these findings were ""straightforward and expected.""

No measurable effect from ginkgo is seen on cognition, Schneider said. ""Regardless of whether people say 'I take it and I feel better,' you just don't see an effect,"" he said.

Still, Schneider won't object if someone wants to try it. ""It is not in my position to deflate hope,"" he said. ""If someone really feels they need to take this and they need to try it, well go ahead and do it. But their expectations should be realistic, and if they don't experience anything, then they probably should stop.""

"Dec. 29, 2009 -- Scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute say they have developed a compound that may be capable of halting a common type of drug-resistant lung cancer.

Their study is published in the Dec. 24/31 issue of the journal Nature.

The researchers say the framework of the new compound is different from that of other cancer drugs and acts against a protein that carries a structural defect, according to a news release. That protein is known as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase.

The scientists say non-small cell lung cancers that had become invulnerable to the chemotherapy drugs Iressa and Tarceva were stymied in a study by a compound designed and formulated in the Dana-Farber laboratory.

The researchers say their new compound shows how fast lung cancer research and development are moving forward.

The Dana-Farber scientists say current [EGFR] inhibitors Iressa and Tarceva prevent EGFR from sending signals that are essential to keep tumor cells growing, the researchers say.

However, over time, the tumor cells develop additional mutations, enabling them to grow again, even in the presence of the drugs Iressa or Tarceva.

The scientists say in the news release that not only did they find that a compound called WZ4002 can slow tumor growth, but that it is possible to ""selectively target the drug-resistant mutant EGFR in tumors, with relatively less effect on the normal EGFR in health tissues.""

Much work lies ahead in determining whether the compound and related ones will prove to be effective therapies, but the researchers say their discovery demonstrates the power of screening specially designed compounds against cancers ""with certain genetic quirks.""

It's early to discuss the use of such compounds in patients, the scientists say, but one of the researchers, Michael J. Eck, MD, PhD, also of Dana-Farber, says he's optimistic their approach ""will lead to an effective treatment for the thousands of non-small cell lung cancer patients worldwide who develop resistance to Iressa and Tarceva every year.""

The new compound seems promising in mouse models, the researchers say, adding they hope it proves effective in clinical trials and is better tolerated than drugs now used.

Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the U.S. for men and women. Non-small cell lung cancer constitutes about 85-90% of lung cancer cases.",1
"Health Experts Call For Heart Checkups For Kids

Enlarge this image toggle caption Michael Perez/AP Michael Perez/AP

In growing numbers, health experts are recommending screening for heart disease in children, especially those who play sports.

One in 100,000 people ages 12 to 24 are estimated to die suddenly and unexpectedly as a result of congenital undiagnosed heart malfunctions. And children who play sports are nearly three times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death than their nonathletic counterparts.

""Few of the kids actually experience sudden death while they're in class or at home,"" says Thomas Debauche, a Houston cardiologist. ""It's pretty much while they're in training or while they're on the field performing, because that's when the adrenalin is flowing,"" and that's when they're calling on the heart for peak performance.

These surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with. Cardiologist Douglas Zipes, past president of the American Academy of Cardiology, says the problems kids suffer are typically electrical, like abnormal heart rhythms, or structural, like a thickening of the heart muscle. Both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports.

According to Zipes, ""The adrenalin that is released when you're participating [in sports] can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem, that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction, no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs."" The result is sudden cardiac death.

Typically, schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports. But Zipes says more should be done.

Cardiologist Debauche agrees. He recently screened more than 2,000 high school athletes in the Houston area, using electrocardiogram, or EKG, to measure the electrical activity of the heart.

About 10 percent of the students had an abnormal EKG. One of them was Louis Anthony, who suffered from asthma. In severe cases, asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death. Anthony's asthma diminished over time, and he says he can still play soccer, run fast and breathe ""just fine.""

After the abnormal EKG result, however, Debauche told Anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma. They have.

For other students who had abnormal EKG results, some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms. About 1 percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports.

Three students had serious heart problems, including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly.

""He was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him,"" Debauche says. ""He was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs.""

Debauche says the heart screening turned out to be life-saving for this student athlete. The student now has an implantable defibrillator and is awaiting a heart transplant.

The severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal EKGs are reason enough, Debauche says, to screen all school athletes nationwide.

Some health experts argue that would be too costly. There's no official policy from the American College of Cardiology, but officials say most members support screening student athletes.

The American Heart Association suggests that athletes who are identified as at risk for heart problems as a result of a family history or physical exam be referred for further cardiovascular examination, which could include an electrocardiogram.",1
"Make that a bottomless cup.

Coffee and tea drinkers are less likely to develop Type 2 diabetes than nondrinkers, with those drinking three to four cups a day at a 25 percent lower risk for the disease than those who drink less than two cups, a large analysis has found. It does not matter whether the drinks are caffeinated or not, said the study, published in The Archives of Internal Medicine.

The analysis does not prove that drinking tea or coffee lowers the risk of the so-called adult-onset diabetes, but it is not the first study to report such a link. And it goes further than other studies, finding that for caffeinated coffee, risk dropped by 5 percent to 10 percent with each additional cup consumed, which the researchers say suggests a causal relationship.

Those drinking more than six cups of coffee a day were at 40 percent lower risk for diabetes than nondrinkers; the figure for those who drank less than a cup per day was just 4 percent.

Some studies have indicated that chemical components of tea and coffee may have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity, but the evidence is mixed. “Caffeine can’t be the answer, because you see the same sort of overall response from diabetes with decaf as with caffeinated coffee,” said the paper’s senior author, Mark Woodward, a professor at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.",0
"Dec. 21, 2009 -- A fatty substance found naturally in the lungs may provide a natural defense against respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection.

New research suggests the substance, a lipid known as POPG, may prevent RSV infection as well as limit the spread of the virus once infection has occurred.

""Our findings demonstrate that POPG is a potent antiviral agent both as

a prophylactic and after infection has occurred,"" researcher Dennis Voelker, PhD, professor of medicine at National Jewish Health in Denver, says in a news release. ""While these are still early studies, several characteristics of POPG make me believe that it has real potential as both an antiviral and anti-inflammatory treatment.""

RSV is the major cause of hospitalization in young children under age 2 and is an increasingly problematic infection in adults with chronic lung disease, the elderly, and those with weakened immune systems. There is no vaccine or easy, effective treatment for RSV.

POPGis one of several lipids found in the fluid that lines the air sacs of the lungs. Researchers say that until now, the function of POPG has been unclear.

In the study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers examined the effects of POPG on RSV infection in human lung cells in the lab and in mice infected with the virus.

They found that inoculating human lung cells with POPG before exposure to RSV prevented infection with the virus as well as the cell death and inflammation normally associated with RSV infection. Applying POPG to the cells after RSV infection also inhibited the spread of the virus to neighboring healthy cells.

In addition, the study showed treating infected mice with POPG dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs.

Researchers say POPG appears to work by binding to RSV and preventing it from binding to other cells. The findings also suggest that POPG’s role in the lungs may be to help the lungs tolerate the daily barrage of inhaled irritants.

POPG is already used in other treatments and has been safely given to millions of premature infants to protect their lungs. It is also inexpensive and easy to use.

Therefore, together with the results of this study, researchers say the compound merits further research as a treatment for RSV infection in humans.",1
"Dec. 15, 2009 (San Antonio) -- A new targeted cancer drug has been shown to shrink tumors in women with metastatic breast cancer after an average of seven other drugs, including Herceptin, failed.

The new drug, called T-DM1, combines Herceptin with a potent chemotherapy drug. It's a Trojan horse approach, where Herceptin homes in on cancer cells and delivers the cancer-killing agent directly to its target.

Tumors shrank in one-third of women with metastatic breast cancer given T-DM1, says Ian Krop, MD, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. In another 12%, tumors stopped growing for at least six months.

The women remained cancer-free for an average of seven months -- results unheard of in patients this sick, he says.

All the women, who had breast tumors for an average of three years, had cancer that had metastasized, or spread to other parts of the body. They had been treated with an average of seven different therapies, including Herceptin, Tykerb, and Xeloda, and each had failed.

""This is the first study looking at women who have failed so many other treatments,"" Krop tells WebMD. ""But we think these results are as good as we've ever seen is such a refractory [sick] population,"" he says.

The findings, published in the Archives of Internal Medicine, add to mounting evidence that Americans are overexposed to radiation from diagnostic tests, especially from a specialized kind of X-ray called a computed tomography, or CT, scan.

“What we learned is there is a significant amount of radiation with these CT scans, more than what we thought, and there is a significant number of cancers,” said Dr. Rita Redberg, editor of the Archives of Internal Medicine, where the studies were published.

“It’s estimated that just from the CT scans done in one year, just in 2007, there will be 15,000 excess deaths,” Redberg said in a telephone interview.

“We’re doing millions of CT scans every year and the numbers are increasing. That is a lot of excess deaths.”

CT scans give doctors a view inside the body, often eliminating the need for exploratory surgery. But CT scans involve much higher radiation dose than conventional X-rays. A chest CT scan exposes the patient to more than 100 times the radiation dose of a chest X-ray.

About 70 million CT scans were done on Americans in 2007, up from 3 million in 1980. Amy Berrington de Gonzalez of the National Cancer Institute and colleagues developed a computer model to estimate the impact of so many scans.

They estimated the scans done in 2007 will cause 29,000 cancers. A third of the projected cancers will occur in people who were ages 35 to 54 when they got their CT, two-thirds will occur in women and 15 percent will arise from scans done in children or teens.

The researchers estimated there will be an extra 2,000 excess breast cancers just from CT scans done in 2007.

UNNEEDED TESTS

Redberg, who wrote a commentary on the studies, said U.S. doctors’ enthusiasm for the tests has led to an explosion in their use that is putting patients at risk.

“While certainly some of the scans are incredibly important and life saving, it is also certain that some of them were not necessary,” Redberg said.

In a separate study, Dr. Rebecca Smith-Bindman of the University of California, San Francisco, and colleagues analyzed data from 1,119 patients undergoing the 11 most common types of diagnostic CT scans at four institutions in 2008.

They found radiation dosage varied widely between different types of CT studies, from a median or midpoint of 2 millisieverts for a routine head CT scan to 31 millisieverts for a scan of the abdomen and pelvis, which often involves taking multiple images of the same organ.

By comparison, the average American is exposed to about 3 millisieverts of radiation a year from ground radon or flying in an airplane — a level not considered a risk to health.

The researchers said efforts need to be taken to minimize CT radiation exposure, including reducing the number of unnecessary tests, cutting the dose per study, and standardizing the doses across facilities.

"Dec. 14, 2009 -- A less invasive needle biopsy may be nearly as effective as surgical biopsy at diagnosing breast cancer, and with far fewer side effects.

A new review of more than 80 studies on the two breast cancer screening methods shows breast needle biopsy was able to distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous breast lesions with about the same accuracy as surgical biopsy and less than half the risk of complications.

Women suspected of having breast cancer after initial screening are usually referred for a biopsy to determine whether the lesion is cancerous. In most cases, the lump or lesion is benign or noncancerous and does not require further treatment.

Biopsies may be performed via open surgery on the breast or with a less invasive core-needle biopsy in which a small sample of breast tissue from the affected area is removed through a special needle inserted through the skin.

Researchers say needle biopsy has fewer complications and a shorter recovery time than open surgical biopsy, but some women and doctors may have concerns about the accuracy of the procedure compared with traditional open surgery methods of breast cancer diagnosis.

In the study, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers reviewed 83 studies on the two methods.

The results showed that core needle biopsies were about as accurate as open surgery at detecting cancerous vs. noncancerous breast lesions.

Needle biopsies also had a much lower rate of complications (less than 1% compared with 2%-10% with open surgery).

In addition, the study showed women initially diagnosed with breast cancer with needle biopsy were more likely to be treated with a single breast cancer surgery than those initially diagnosed by open surgical biopsy.

""Based on currently available evidence, it appears reasonable to substitute core needle biopsy procedures for open surgical biopsy given the comparable sensitivity and lower complication rates,"" write researcher Wendy Bruening, PhD, of the ECRI Institute Evidence-Based Practices Center in Plymouth Meeting, Pa., and colleagues. They say additional studies are needed to find out what factors affect the accuracy of core-needle breast biopsy.",1
"(CNN) -- As a thick, gray haze began to descend over the words in her schoolbooks, and eventually the faces of loved ones, Barbara Campbell barely grasped that she was going blind.

""I didn't realize that I wasn't seeing the same as everybody else, because how would I know that?"" said Campbell, 56, who began losing her sight in middle school.

By the time Campbell reached adulthood, her vision was gone.

""It's like looking through a frosted window,"" Campbell said of how she sees the world. ""It's like that all the time.""

Doctors diagnosed retinitis pigmentosa, a progressive eye disease that damages the cells of the retina, the part of the eye that detects light.

For years, Campbell survived -- even thrived -- as a blind woman navigating New York City. Then earlier this year, she went from coping with blindness to hoping she might see again.

Campbell is one of only 14 people in the United States participating in an FDA-approved study of an artificial retina -- a microchip implanted in the eye to stimulate damaged cells.

""Amazing,"" said Campbell with a smile. ""It's like 'Star Trek.' ""

A microchip to help someone see may sound more like a ""Star Trek"" device than legitimate science, but it is real.

""This is really the first step toward a really bionic eye,"" said Aries Arditi, a senior fellow in vision science at Lighthouse International, a nonprofit advocacy group for the blind and one of the study sites for the artificial retina.

A healthy retina sends electrical signals to the brain, telling it how to decipher light. A damaged retina cannot transmit those signals, so the artificial retina is outfitted with rows of tiny electrodes to do the job.

In July, Campbell underwent surgery to implant the microchip into her eye.

""When light goes into [Campbell's] eyes, she doesn't see anything, because it's not being projected by the cells of the retina,"" said Dr. Lucian Del Priore, an ophthalmologist at New York Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center, who implanted Campbell's artificial retina.

""This is an artificial device that essentially stimulates the retina electrically,"" Del Priore said.

How to see a tree artificially

Since her eyes cannot detect light or images on their own, Campbell wears a pair of sunglasses outfitted with a small camera. As she scans and focuses the camera on an object in her environment -- for example, a tree -- a wireless device transmits that image to the artificial retina inside her eye.

The electrodes on the microchip then stimulate cells on the retina roughly in the shape of the tree. The shape is communicated to the brain -- the idea being that Campbell might one day perceive some semblance of a shape of that tree.

""It's a rudimentary level of vision,"" said Brian Mech, vice president of business development at Second Sight Medical Products Inc., the developer and manufacturer of the artificial retina. ""But for people without vision, that can be pretty remarkable.""

In 2002, the first-generation artificial retina had only 16 electrodes.

""Patients were able to do things that we would not have anticipated with so few electrodes,"" Mech said. ""One patient could shoot baskets, and another was crossing crosswalks.""

Campbell received one of the second-generation artificial retinas with 60 electrodes, and thus far, according to her doctors, has made significant progress.

When she stands outside her apartment building, she can now sense light emanating from windows. Navigating up the stairs of her building, she now knows that there is light illuminating the hallways. And when she arrives home and makes tea, she can sense light coming from the burners on the stove.

And just recently, during a vision test, Campbell was able to correctly identify a sequence of letters for the first time in decades.

""I was like, 'You're kidding,' "" Campbell said. ""I was shocked. I still can't believe it.""

Campbell's doctors try to temper her excitement and that of other study participants.

""Being able to repair, in some way, a function that has been lost is a very exciting thing,"" Del Priore said. ""But it is important to be realistic.""

Recognizing faces, driving or reading the small print in newspapers is a very long way off, Mech said. And while some patients like Campbell do well with the implant, there are some who struggle.

Still, the feeling among those involved in the study is tempered excitement.

""We can now take someone who is totally blind and turn them into someone with very, very poor vision,"" said Arditi, who trains Campbell weekly on how to nurture her vision. ""That's really the first time in history we've been able to do that.""

Devices with 100 and 1,000 electrodes are in production, and the hope, Mech said, is that more electrodes will mean more-detailed vision.

Today, the artificial retina is primarily for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa, but it could expand to other diseases, like dry age-related macular degeneration, Mech said.

There are 100,000 people in the United States affected by retinitis pigmentosa, according to the National Eye Institute, a division of the National Institutes of Health.

Training Campbell's eye and brain to see again will take years of rehabilitation. Her vision is in black-and-white and will never be perfect.

Those factors do not prevent Campbell from dreaming.

""What I'd actually really hoped, and I'm not sure if it's going to happen, is seeing colors,"" Campbell said. ""If I could see colors again, my plan was to go to the Grand Canyon.""",1
