Get vaccinated before you travel
The vaccines recommended or required for an international traveler depend on several factors, including age, health, and itinerary.
Take these steps to make sure you are prepared for your trip:
- Make sure you are up-to-date with all recommended vaccines. Talk with your healthcare provider and get any vaccines that you may have missed. Take a short quiz and get a list of vaccines you may need based on your lifestyle, travel habits, and other factors.
- Learn the recommended and required vaccines for your destination. Visit Travelers' Health: Destinations for more information about recommendations and requirements for the locations you will be visiting during your travel.
