Strategy and Development
We help faculty create the foundation for successful research.
With experts in so many diverse topics, The Bloomberg School seeks to enhance our faculty's ability to identify potential collaborators and navigate access to data, sample, and participant research resources. Team science is encouraged, and interdisciplinary approaches predominate our research teams.
Our faculty are highly successful in obtaining funding for their research activities. We support them by regularly providing information on potential funding opportunities, both internal and external, and guidance on how to navigate the application process of our main funders like the National Institutes of Health. Increasingly, successful grant applications involve pre-review by mentors and peers and sharing of best practices and grant templates.
