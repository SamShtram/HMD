Accelerating Medicines Partnership (AMP)
Launched in 2014, the Accelerating Medicines Partnership® (AMP®) program is a public-private partnership between the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA), multiple biopharmaceutical and life science companies, non-profit and other organizations to transform the current model for developing new diagnostics and treatments.
AMP partners share a common goal of increasing the number of new diagnostics and therapies for patients and reduce the time and cost of developing them. The AMP program aims to improve understanding of therapeutically relevant biological pathways and validate information that could be relevant for the development of multiple therapeutics.
Through this cross-sector partnership, managed through the Foundation for the NIH (FNIH), NIH and AMP partners are sharing expertise and resources to enable the best-informed contributions to science from all participants.
ACCELERATING MEDICINES PARTNERSHIP and AMP are registered service marks of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services.
