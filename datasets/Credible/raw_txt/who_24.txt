Health Inequality Data Repository
Disaggregated data – which show how health or other aspects of life are experienced by people of different ages, economic status, education levels, place of residence, sex, and other characteristics – are a vital part of advancing equity.
Disaggregated data can serve as an evidence base for equity-oriented policies, programmes and practices that aim to close existing gaps and achieve good health and well-being for all.
The Health Inequality Data Repository contains datasets of disaggregated data covering diverse topics and dimensions of inequality, from a variety of publicly available data sources. It aims to make disaggregated data more accessible and navigable to diverse global audiences.
Please note that some datasets are from external published sources and are therefore not WHO official estimates. Please refer to the Indicator Metadata for more information about the data.
