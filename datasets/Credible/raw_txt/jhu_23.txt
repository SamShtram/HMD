Each session will provide participants an opportunity to learn more about the initiatives and resources offered by the IDARE office, as well as insights into the experiences of current students and recent alums who identify as first-generation and/or members of underrepresented or underserved groups (URGs). All are welcome.

Master's Program Information Session
You've probably noticed that we offer nine—yes nine!—master's degrees in public health. And you may have wondered how they differ from one another and which one is right for you.
