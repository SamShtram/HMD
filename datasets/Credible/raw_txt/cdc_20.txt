What is prediabetes?
Before developing type 2 diabetes, most people have prediabetes. This is when their blood sugar is higher than normal but not high enough yet for a type 2 diabetes diagnosis. In the United States, about 98 million adults have prediabetes; that's 1 in 3 people.
There are usually no signs when you have prediabetes, which is why 81% of people don't know they have it. You can have prediabetes for years and not know.
