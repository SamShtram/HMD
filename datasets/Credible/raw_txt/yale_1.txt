Patient Tools
We want everything about your experience with Yale Medicine to be as easy and convenient as possible. The Patient Tools section of our website is designed to provide you with the information and resources you need, from scheduling an appointment, to preparing for both in-person and telehealth visits, to getting a second opinion from a Yale Medicine specialist.
If you have questions that aren't answered on our website, please contact our Yale Medicine Coordination, Appointment, Referral & Engagement (CARE) Center at 1-877-YALEMDS (877-925-3637).
Self-Schedule an AppointmentCopy Link
Yale Medicine is pleased to provide the convenience of self-scheduling to new and returning patients.
Paperless BillingCopy Link
Yale Medicine and Yale New Haven Health are pleased to provide you with a secure, convenient, and eco-friendly way to view your bills. Beginning January 3, 2023, we’re going paperless (for MyChart users). If you have a MyChart account, instead of receiving a paper bill by mail each month, you will receive an email, text, and/or MyChart notification when you have a new balance available for viewing.
