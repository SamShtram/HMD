Paying Your Bill
Questions?
If you have questions about your bill, please call our Central Billing Line at 1-800-826-9922 or email patient.services@yale.edu. We are available Monday through Friday from 8:30 am to 5:00 pm.
We are going paperless on January 3, 2023
To deliver a more secure, convenient, and eco-friendly way to view your bills, Yale Medicine and Yale New Haven Health will switch to paperless billing for MyChart users starting January 3, 2023.
Instead of receiving a paper bill by mail each month, you will receive an email, text, and/or MyChart notification when you have a new balance available for viewing.
You can opt out and change back to paper statements beginning January 3.
If you are not a MyChart user, you can sign up at https://mychart.ynhhs.org.
See detailed information and frequently asked questions about the switch to paperless billing.
For any questions related to these changes, please call Yale Medicine at 203-785-4216 or 800-826-9922.
