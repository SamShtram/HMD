Information Sessions and How to Apply
The Office of Admissions Services is the go-to resource for students who are interested in exploring a public health education at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.
Nine Master's Degrees
The Bloomberg School offers nine different master’s degree programs to train you to become the next public health leader.
Two Doctoral Degrees
The Bloomberg School’s doctoral degree programs target students with specific career goals in public health research, teaching or leadership, and typically require a longer time commitment. We offer the Doctor of Public Health (DrPH) and the Doctor of Philosophy (PhD).
Continuing and Executive Education
The Bloomberg School also offers the following programs to meet the needs of lifelong learners at any stage of their public health careers:
Accelerated Path to a Master's Degree for Goucher College Students
The Bloomberg School's partnership with Goucher College offers their students an accelerated path to a master’s degree, where they can earn their undergraduate degree at Goucher while pursuing a Master of Health Science (MHS) from the Department of Health, Behavior and Society or a Master of Bioethics (MBE) from the Bloomberg School.
The Writing Center works with all students enrolled in degree programs at the Bloomberg School.
The Bloomberg School Writing Center offers degree-seeking students free, individual conferences with experienced tutors, all of whom are careful and perceptive readers of all types of writing done at the School.
Our online students enjoy a complete Bloomberg School experience.
We offer best-in-class online teaching, delivered via our proprietary CoursePlus learning platform. We also offer remote students the full array of opportunities outside the classroom.
As a premier public health institution, we believe it is part of our mission to share knowledge freely and openly.
We make many free offerings available via Coursera. We also make many events and publications open to the public to enable broader understanding and application of public health expertise.
