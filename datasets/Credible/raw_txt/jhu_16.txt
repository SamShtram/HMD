Student Life
Student life at the Bloomberg School is everything from working in a lab on top-notch research to enjoying the cultural diversity of Baltimore.
Students enjoy a collegial environment both within and outside the walls of the school – taking advantage of both the expertise of the faculty and also the rich life experiences of their classmates. On a given day, students are taking classes, attending seminars, publishing papers, working in labs, participating in field work, volunteering with local nonprofits and enjoying the city of Baltimore.
International Students
The Bloomberg School welcomes its international students with open arms and takes pride in the diversity of the entire student body.
The largest school of public health in the world, the Bloomberg School is currently home to more than 2,900 students from more than 80 countries who meet here in Baltimore to pursue their public health careers.
Because there is such a strong international presence among students, the environment automatically fosters a sense of open learning, mutual respect and friendly collaboration.
By joining culturally-themed student groups and other organizations outside the school, international students also tend to take full advantage of living in Baltimore.
If you are an international student interested in applying to the Bloomberg School, be sure to review the information listed on the Admissions Office’s international students page.
The Office of International Services also provides many resources – including visa information – for international students, faculty and staff at the Bloomberg School, the School of Nursing and the Johns Hopkins Hospital.
Current and past students agree—life at the Bloomberg School is always exciting.
