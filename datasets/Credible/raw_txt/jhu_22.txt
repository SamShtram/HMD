Implementation and Impact
The School is focused on ensuring that all steps in the research process can be facilitated, starting with building and communicating with research teams.
Implementing complex research studies around the world is an extremely challenging task. Research teams at the Bloomberg School often recruit study participants in difficult to reach places and from underrepresented and challenging life situations. Our faculty lead cohorts of well-characterized study participants linked to highly informative biorepositories which allows investigation of pathways and biomarkers of health outcomes.
Our faculty are able to recruit great staff, students and postdocs to contribute to our research success. We advocate for procedures to make certain that data collection, management and analyses are high quality, as well as to ensure the integrity and security of data. Opportunities abound for participation in writing accountability groups and sharing one's research in progress. Our communications teams help with broader dissemination of important research findings and ensure impact beyond the academic literature.
