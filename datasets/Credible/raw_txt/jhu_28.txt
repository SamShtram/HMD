- What is Public Health?
The Bloomberg School's leadership team includes Dean Pollack Porter, her office of vice, associate, and assistant deans, and the chairs of the 10 academic departments and the MPH and DrPH programs.
They are advised by the Faculty Senate, Student Assembly, Staff Assembly, and Health Advisory Board as they consider the priorities, procedures, and future planning of the School. Together, these leaders bring a well-rounded lens to management and oversight of the School's academic, research, and practice activities.
