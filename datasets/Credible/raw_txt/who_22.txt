All for Health, Health for All is WHO’s third investment case and has been produced alongside the Fourteenth General Programme of Work (GPW 14) to capture the impact of a fully funded WHO over the period 2025–2028.
Why invest in WHO?
Investing in the World Health Organization is an investment in the health of all people, at all ages, everywhere.
Since 1948, WHO has played a pivotal role in advancing global health, ensuring equitable access to essential health services, responding to health emergencies, and setting standards for all areas of health.
WHO has made some remarkable achievements including the eradication of smallpox, reductions in child mortality, and significant progress in combating diseases like malaria and tuberculosis.
WHO offers unparalleled global reach, legitimacy and expertise. It translates science and evidence into proven, affordable and effective solutions and action for physical and mental health. With presence in more than 150 countries, across all regions of the world, it works hand-in-hand with its 194 Member States, partners, health workers and communities to build the systems and implement interventions needed to keep people healthy and achieve health for all.
WHO supports countries to make healthy choices the easiest choices for their citizens, from promoting healthy diets and creating tobacco- and pollution-free environments, to scaling up access to safe life-saving tools like vaccines, diagnostics and treatments.
WHO coordinates humanitarian action in emergencies, scales up in-country action for people in need, and quickly mobilizes support through trusted and committed global networks.
And WHO is the only global convening place where all countries and partners committed to health come and work together for the well-being of everyone, everywhere, no matter age, income levels, gender or birthplace.
