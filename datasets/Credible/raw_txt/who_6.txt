WHO is a specialized United Nations agency with a constitutional mandate as the Directing and Coordinating authority on international health work. Procurement is a critical function in support of the effective discharge of the WHO mandate. In order to fulfill its mandate and achieve its vision, WHO must procure a significant volume of goods and services.
On average, WHO buys over US$ 1 billion worth of goods and services every year to maintain operations in the field and to react to upcoming and recurring demands.
As a public organization entrusted with donor funds and committed to supporting developing economies, the objective of procurement activities within WHO is the timely acquisition of goods and services while adhering to guiding principles.
