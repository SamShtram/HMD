Freedom of Information Act Office
Notice to FOIA Requesters
Please submit all requests through our online portal rather than mail, fax, or courier, to ensure timely logging of your request. If you need to submit a payment, to ensure that it can be processed in a timely manner, please use pay.gov.
Welcome
The NIH FOIA office generally handles three different categories of requests:
- requests for information maintained by the Office of the Director, NIH
- requests that involve trans NIH issues or initiatives unless a specific IC has responsibility
- requests for information that will not be released because it is protected by one or more of the FOIA's nine exemptions or three exclusions
While all requests may be sent to the NIH FOIA Office, each of NIH's separate Institutes and Centers has its own FOIA Coordinator. Requesters should direct requests for information about a specific NIH component to that component. A list of the FOIA Coordinators for each component is available at this site for your convenience.
Background/Overview
The Freedom of Information Act (“FOIA”), 5 U.S.C. 552, provides individuals with a right to access to records in the possession of the federal government. The government may withhold information pursuant to the nine exemptions and three exclusions contained in the Act.
