newswise dec vitamin c may reduce the harm done to lungs in infants born to mothers who smoke during their pregnancy according to a randomized controlled trial published online in the american thoracic society s american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine in oral vitamin c mg day to pregnant smokers improves infant airway function at months a randomized trial cindy t mcevoy md mcr and her co authors report that at three months of age the infants whose mothers took mg of vitamin c in addition to their prenatal vitamin had significantly better forced expiratory flows fefs fefs measure how fast air can be exhaled from the lung and are an important measure of lung function because they can detect airway obstruction the researchers also discovered an association between the infant fefs and a genetic variant some of the mothers possessed that appeared to amplify the negative impact of nicotine on the babies before they were born other studies have linked this genetic factor specifically for the α nicotinic acetylcholine receptor to increased risk of lung cancer and obstructive lung disease smoking during pregnancy reflects the highly addictive nature of nicotine that disproportionately affects the most vulnerable populations said dr mcevoy lead study author and professor of pediatrics at oregon health science university finding a way to help infants exposed to smoking and nicotine in utero recognizes the unique dangers posed by a highly advertised addictive product and the lifetime effects on offspring who did not choose to be exposed in a previous study the authors had shown that hours after birth babies of mothers who smoked had better lung function if their mothers were randomized to vitamin c mg day during their pregnancies compared to those born to mothers who smoked and were randomized to placebo that study used passive methods to measure lung function and the authors note that fefs provide a more direct assessment of airway function and are similar to methods used to diagnose lung disease in adults and older children in the current study pregnant women who smoked were randomly assigned at to weeks of gestation to either receive vitamin c women or a placebo women smoking was defined as having had one or more cigarettes in the last week all participants received smoking cessation counseling throughout the study and about percent of the women quit smoking during the study the researchers wrote that study results support the hypothesis that oxidative stress caused by cigarette smoking reduces the amount of ascorbic acid a component of vitamin c available to the body at the time they enrolled in the study the women had lower levels of ascorbic acid than have been reported among women who do not smoke those levels rose in study participants who received vitamin c to become comparable to women who do not smoke infants in this study will continue to be followed to track their lung function and respiratory outcomes the authors believe that future trials of vitamin c supplementation in pregnant smokers should determine whether the benefits are greater if the supplementation starts earlier and continues postnatally in the babies themselves summing up the findings of the current study dr mcevoy said that a relatively low dosage of vitamin c may present a safe and inexpensive intervention that has the potential to help lung health of millions of infants worldwide however she added helping mothers quit smoking should remain the primary goal for health professionals and public health officials although vitamin c supplementation may protect to some extent the lungs of babies born to mothers who smoke during pregnancy those children will still be at greater risk for obesity behavioral disorders and other

newswise houston for the first time transplanting gut bacteria from healthy donors was used to successfully treat patients suffering from severe colitis caused by treatment with immune checkpoint inhibitors icis the study from the university of texas md anderson cancer center which includes two patients suggests fecal microbiota transplantation fmt is worth investigating in clinical trials as a therapy for this common side effect of immunotherapy the research led by yinghong wang m d ph d assistant professor of gastroenterology hepatology nutrition and director of medication induced colitis and enteritis was published today in nature medicine the resolution of colitis in these patients can be confirmed clinically and endoscopically after fmt treatment said wang based on these results this should be evaluated even as a first line therapy for ici associated colitis because it s safe quick and the effect is durable from one treatment immune checkpoint inhibitors which release a block on the immune system to attack cancer have been successful in providing durable responses for patients with several cancer types however these treatments are often associated with significant immune related toxicities colitis inflammation of the colon is the second most common side effect from icis occurring in up to percent of patients explained wang when ici associated colitis is severe guidelines require a patient to stop ici treatment until the colitis is in remission if the patient is a good responder to immunotherapy that means you ve taken their effective treatment away said wang we have a limited amount of time to fix the problem so they can resume ici treatment but i feel that we ve made great progress in this area the researchers chose to investigate the potential for fmt as an alternative compassionate use therapy for patients suffering from refractory or unresponsive ici associated colitis the two patients included in the study were treated at md anderson between june and january fmt has shown promise in treating other types of gastrointestinal diseases such as recurrent clostridium difficile infection and inflammatory bowel disease ibd which shares many clinical and molecular characteristics with ici associated colitis these conditions typically are treated with steroids and targeted immunosuppressive agents which result in additional severe side effects and can counteract the effects of immunotherapy both patients in the study had a complete resolution of their colitis following treatment with fmt the first patient s colitis resolved within two weeks following a single fmt treatment the second patient experienced a partial recovery after the first treatment followed by complete recovery after a second fmt with endoscopic evaluation before and after treatment both patients displayed significant improvements in inflammation and ulcerations including a reduction of inflammatory immune cells pre and post treatment stool analyses revealed patients gut microbiomes to be most similar to the donor immediately after treatment with less resemblance to the donor over time still post treatment gut bacteria remained distinct from their own pre treatment microbiome additionally distinct new populations of bacterial species were evident in these patients following fmt compared to pre treatment samples including several species known to be protective or reduce inflammation the authors acknowledge significant limitations to this study based on the very small cohort and they plan to pursue clinical trials to investigate the effectiveness of fmt in treating ici associated colitis as compared with standard immunosuppressive therapy fmt continues to be offered to md anderson patients on a compassionate use basis previous md anderson research showed that bacteria in the gut influence patient response to ici therapy and other evidence suggests modifying the microbiome in mice can alter their response to immunotherapy the current data further suggests there is the potential for many molecular studies to better understand the role of the microbiome in driving ici colitis and immunotherapy response more broadly the study was supported by the andrew sabin family fellowship program the american association for cancer research stand up to cancer the national institutes of health ca a hl the cancer prevention research institute of texas and the melanoma moon shot part of md anderson s moon shots program a collaborative effort to accelerate the development of scientific discoveries into clinical advances that save

newswise baltimore md oct the maryland proton treatment center mptc is now offering deep tissue external thermal therapy in combination with high precision proton beam radiotherapy as a potential way to boost survival chances for certain cancer patients mptc is the only center in the world to offer these two treatments at the same facility an advantage to patients because these therapies are typically given within an hour of each other research has shown that thermal therapy can be especially useful in difficult to reach cancers in the abdomen and pelvic region studies have found that adding thermal therapy to standard treatments can significantly shrink tumors and can improve survival for some patients external thermal therapy or hyperthermia in the range of up to f sensitizes tumor cells to chemotherapy and radiation therapy in addition heat has been shown to enhance anti tumor immune response we are very pleased to be able to offer deep tissue thermal therapy which can be combined with standard radiation therapy as well as proton beam therapy to enhance the cancer killing effects of the radiation says zeljko vujaskovic md phd a professor of radiation oncology and director of the division of translational radiation sciences dtrs in the department of radiation oncology at the university of maryland school of medicine umsom early research suggests that adding thermal therapy to proton beam therapy may be associated with an even greater benefit than when combined with standard radiation therapy and we are excited to be at the forefront of making this combination therapy available to cancer patients says dr vujaskovic an internationally recognized expert in hyperthermic oncology proton therapy is a precise form of radiation therapy that deposits all of its energy within the tumor and allows for less irradiation of noncancerous tissue mptc which is affiliated with the university of maryland marlene and stewart greenebaum comprehensive cancer center umgccc at the university of maryland medical center is the only proton treatment center in maryland radiation oncologists at umgccc already use external thermal therapy to treat a range of cancers but do not currently use it for cancers that are deeper in the body according to dr vujaskovic the new deep tissue thermal therapy equipment which is made by pyrexar will be used to treat cancers of the abdominal and pelvic region including cancer of the bladder rectum cervix ovaries pancreas and connective tissue which are known as sarcomas patients would typically receive the thermal therapy two times a week for an hour before or after they receive standard photon radiation or proton beam therapy the system heats the tumor tissue to f with internal and external probes that enable doctors to continuously monitor the temperature a water filled applicator is placed over the area to be treated and non invasive radio frequency energy is directed at the tumor the heat causes the blood vessels in the tumor to dilate bringing more oxygen into the tumor which makes cancer cells more vulnerable to radiation therapy the acquisition of the deep tissue thermal therapy system was made possible by donations from jack and emily howell and the middendorf foundation inc within the department of radiation oncology and throughout our cancer center we strive to make every available tool in the cancer fighting toolbox available to our patients says william f regine md facr facro the isadore fannie schneider foxman endowed chair and professor of radiation oncology at umsom and chair of radiation oncology at umgccc by continuing to develop a comprehensive thermal oncology program we are giving patients more effective treatment options and therefore another reason to hope for better outcomes the maryland proton treatment center has achieved another milestone by becoming the first center to offer both deep thermal therapy and proton therapy says e albert reece md phd mba

rehovot israel sept prnewswire nucleix ltd a leading cancer detection company announced today positive results from a clinical study designed to evaluate its innovative lung epicheck a blood test for early detection of lung cancer the results will be presented in a poster presentation titled lung epicheck results of the training and test sets of a methylation based blood test for early detection of lung cancer at the iaslc th world conference on lung cancer hosted by the international association for the study of lung cancer to take place on september in toronto canada in the study blood was prospectively collected from centers and biobanks in europe and israel the samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the lung epicheck blood test lung epicheck was validated on this independent test set comprising lung cancer cases and current or former smoker controls results show specificity of and a sensitivity of with an area under the curve auc of these results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from lung cancer cases and current or former smoker controls in particular in the non small cell lung carcinoma group n the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about of lung cancer patients lung epicheck was able to identify correctly approximately of patients with a correct identification of of stage i patients of stage ii of stage iii and of stage iv patients in the small cell lung cancer group n lung epicheck was able to identify correctly of the patients with a sensitivity of in the limited stage and at the extensive stage lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages stated prof mina gaga the president of the european respiratory society ers and a lead investigator in the study clearly we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide at the moment low dose computerized tomography ldct screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large nlst study is only reimbursed in the us for high risk individuals ldct screening is not reimbursed in europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early operable stages for the entire at risk population so currently not only ct screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested i am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study showing that epicheck has the ability to identify both non small cell and small cell lung cancer at early stages with a high level of sensitivity and specificity such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve year survival from about to about this will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer we are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer said opher shapira phd ceo of nucleix furthermore these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort currently early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally when testing for other conditions or by using low dose ct scans which are costly carry associated risks such as high radiation and are employed only for a very high risk population early detection of lung cancer can be a game changer in the fight against this devastating disease and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the us europe and china next year in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price about lung epicheck the lung epicheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms the technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in dna methylation patterns a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body dying tumor cells release cell free dna cfdna into the blood where cancer specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage the lung epicheck blood test detects changes in dna methylation in markers in cfdna associated with lung cancer about lung cancer lung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types it is estimated that there are about million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about million die from the disease each year the reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic which is usually at late stages of the disease to date there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer bringing year survival rate to approximately in addition there is a well defined risk group for developing the disease mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of in the us low dose ct is available for screening of individuals years old who smoked at least pack a day for years which represent less than half of the lung cancer population therefore a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival about nucleix nucleix ltd develops manufactures and markets innovative non invasive molecular cancer diagnostic tests its highly sensitive and specific tests are based on

isnes belgium aug prnewswire volitionrx limited nyse american vnrx volition today announced preliminary data from a prospective multi centered proof of concept study of men into the utility of volition s nu q assays to diagnose men with high grade prostate cancer volition panel psa alone at specificity the volition panel of five assays including psa identified of high grade prostate cancers that require treatment as defined by gleason score this compares with just identified by prostate specific antigen psa alone this is a very exciting outcome for us as we continue the development of our assays beyond colorectal cancer the preliminary data from this study showed that volition s panel of assays identified men with potentially lethal high grade prostate cancer with much greater accuracy than psa alone based on this data we believe that this test could assist clinicians in more accurate patient selection for prostate biopsy and treatment and substantially reduce the amount of unnecessary procedures in men with low grade tumors or no tumor the next step is to confirm these statistically significant findings in independent larger clinical trials said dr jake micallef chief scientific officer at volition prostate cancer pca is the second leading cause of cancer death in men in the u s after lung cancer currently pca is diagnosed through medical history physical examination and by elevated levels of psa in the blood men suspected of pca are given a prostate biopsy to confirm the presence of cancer however most men with elevated psa levels referred for prostate biopsy either have no cancer or have low grade cancer which needs monitoring but not treatment in the proof of concept study a blood sample was taken prospectively from men referred for prostate biopsy in three belgian hospitals the men were grouped by biopsy findings as having no cancer most of whom had elevated psa levels low grade cancer or high grade cancer the samples were tested with a panel of five assays psa two nu q assays and two inflammatory biomarkers the assay results correlated with the gleason score which is one of the main predictors for aggressive pca determined on biopsy this suggests the assays may provide better risk stratification than that available using psa tests for men with actual or suspected pca leading to better patient management and fewer unnecessary biopsies commenting on the results principal investigator professor thierry roumeguere head of urological services erasme hospital brussels belgium said a non invasive test to help in the risk stratification of men with suspected or actual prostate cancer will be a major step forward in the management of this disease the correlation of the panel blood test results with gleason score shows great promise in this regard we will further investigate the data in relation to disease stage as well as additional factors used for pre treatment risk stratification cameron reynolds chief executive officer at volition commented this small trial is important because it helps demonstrate once more the potential breadth of our technology if these results are validated in larger trials they will present a potentially significant new market opportunity volition s research team is continuing to develop our nu q assays and we aim to launch products in dr gaetan michel chief executive officer of volition s wholly owned subsidiary belgian volition sprl commented we would like to thank the walloon region for their continued support of the company the funding provided by the

irvine calif aug prnewswire mdxhealth sa otc mdxhf br today announces that a new study validates the cost effectiveness of the selectmdx for prostate cancer test a non invasive urine based liquid biopsy test that helps identify patients at increased risk of aggressive prostate cancer the selectmdx test can help predict the likelihood that clinically significant prostate cancer will be found by a biopsy the study published in the journal of urology led by researchers at the vanderbilt university medical center was designed to elucidate the cost effectiveness of selectmdx in a population of u s men with elevated psa a marker of prostate cancer risk researchers analyzed the impact of utilizing the non invasive diagnostic test prior to prostate biopsy the primary objective was to characterize changes in health outcomes measured in quality adjusted life years and a secondary objective was evaluating healthcare costs the researchers found that incorporating selectmdx resulted in an average gain of life years or approximately days in full health gained at a cost savings of for each patient undergoing biopsy extrapolating these data to a conservative estimate of patients per year undergoing biopsy resulted in life years in full health gained with an annual cost saving of more than million for each cohort this study demonstrated that routine use of selectmdx to guide biopsy decision making improves health outcomes and lowers healthcare costs associated with prostate cancer risk assessment in a population of u s men said dr matthew resnick from the departments of urologic surgery and health policy at vanderbilt university medical center nashville tn we believe that this strategy improves the value of conventional risk assessment strategies through improvements in both quality and cost the numerator and denominator of the health care value equation every year million men in the u s undergo a prostate biopsy i although a biopsy is the only way to diagnose prostate cancer the procedure is invasive and results in complications in percent of patients with percent hospitalized for infection within days ii iii iv common complications from a prostate biopsy may include bleeding infection sepsis bacteremia urinary symptoms retention and sexual dysfunction while biopsy is the only path to prostate cancer diagnosis no man wants to nor should have to go through the uncomfortable costly procedure if it can be avoided said dr jan groen chief executive officer of mdxhealth we developed selectmdx to help reduce unnecessary biopsies and now we have the

new york and san diego june prnewswire an international team of researchers from memorial sloan kettering cancer center msk epic sciences the institute of cancer research uk and london health sciences centre canada have shown that a blood test can identify patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer mcrpc who may live longer if they switch from targeted androgen receptor signaling inhibitor arsi therapy such as enzalutamide and abiraterone to taxane based chemotherapy this independent multicenter blinded study is one of the first studies to validate that a liquid biopsy test can predict therapeutic response and demonstrate a survival benefit the blood test called oncotype dx ar v nucleus detect is commercially available in the u s through epic science s partnership with genomic health inc nasdaq ghdx the research was published online today in jama oncology this liquid biopsy test addresses a critical unmet need at a decision point in management to predict and select the therapy that is most likely to extend a patient s life said howard scher m d who led the study and is the co chair center for mechanism based therapy and head of the biomarker development initiative at msk during the treatment of metastatic prostate cancer physicians will now be able to use ar v status to determine when a patient s cancer has become resistant to androgen receptor directed therapy and will respond better to chemotherapy enabling the patient to live longer this blinded four year study followed mcrpc patients who were treated at msk the royal marsden or the london health sciences centre blood samples were obtained prior to treatment with arsi therapy or chemotherapy and tested with a validated assay for the nuclear localized androgen receptor splice variant ar v protein in circulating tumor cells the results were that patients positive for ar v who were treated with taxane based chemotherapy had superior overall survival os relative to those treated with arsi therapy median os vs months importantly patients negative for ar v who were treated with arsi therapy had superior os relative to those treated with taxanes media os vs months additionally the authors validated the test within a prognostic risk group to ensure that the biomarker effect was due to the biomarker rather than other clinical variables we developed this test specifically to address a significant clinical question in metastatic prostate cancer that previously had no clear answer which treatment should be pursued next this question weighs heavily on doctors and patients but now with the oncotype dx ar v test we can provide them the confidence to know whether continuing with hormonal therapy or switching to chemotherapy will result in better survival outcomes said ryan dittamore chief of medical innovation at epic sciences and a co author on the study in addition the survival benefit gained through the utilization of our ar v test could make the test as valuable to a patient s outcome as a blockbuster cancer drug this is the second blinded multi center clinical utility validation study utilizing the nuclear localized ar v test earlier this month dr andrew armstrong of duke cancer institute presented data validating the test in the prophecy clinical trial at the asco annual meeting the prophecy study investigated the ar v test in patients receiving arsi therapy and demonstrated that patients who tested positive had worse survival by all measures and had no clinical benefit from arsi therapy in march of this year based upon earlier studies utilizing the test palmetto gba a medicare administrative contractor that assesses molecular diagnostic technologies issued a draft local coverage determination lcd for the oncotype dx ar v nucleus detect test a full lcd for the test is expected in the upcoming months and would support medicare reimbursement for applicable patients considering arsi or taxane therapies it is estimated that patients a year may be eligible for and benefit from the oncotype dx ar v nucleus detect test the paper is entitled assessment of the validity of nuclear localized androgen receptor splice variant in circulating tumor cells as a predictive biomarker for castration resistant prostate cancer about the oncotype dx ar v nucleus detect test designed by epic sciences and based on results from multiple studies led by memorial sloan kettering cancer center the oncotype dx ar v nucleus detect test is the first and only liquid biopsy test of its kind that can potentially prolong the lives of men with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer mcrpc by helping their physician identify the most effective treatment through a blood draw the test detects ar v protein in the nucleus of circulating tumor cells utilizing epic sciences no cell left behind platform to accurately identify patients who are resistant to androgen receptor ar targeted therapies and who should instead switch to chemotherapy the oncotype dx ar v nucleus detect test will be performed by epic sciences at its centralized clia certified laboratory in san diego and offered exclusively by genomic

chordoma is a cancer that occurs in the bones of the spine sacrum and skull base only about americans are diagnosed with this cancer each year the tumors can be complex to treat because they are located along the spinal cord nerves and arteries chordomas are part of a group of tumors called sarcomas while slow growing they can be aggressive life threatening tumor blindsided by the news his tailbone pain was caused by a life threatening tumor tracy sought information and opinions his doctor referred him to specialists at a major medical center in san francisco he learned surgery is the most common treatment but a surgeon told tracy and wife karin rittenberg he should prepare for possible complications said tracy we were told that i should prepare myself for the loss of functionality below the waist including bowel bladder and sexual functions even with surgery there was a high risk of recurrence that s when we began to research other options such as radiation therapy treatment options the couple then met with a radiation oncologist the doctor explained in cases where surgery is not an option or the outcome of surgery was unacceptable people turn to definitive radiation therapy he provided tracy and karin with a copy of a published research paper on chordoma and the effects of definitive radiation the lead author and researcher was dr peyman kabolizadeh clinical director beaumont proton therapy center in royal oak while the findings were written for health care professionals and very technical tracy was encouraged definitive radiation therapy refers to curative radiation explained dr kabolizadeh radiation is the only treatment the patient receives in his study published in the international journal of radiation oncology biology physics he and his colleagues found in circumstances where surgery may result in significant neurologic or organ dysfunction patients can be treated definitively with radiation therapy alone the results supported the use of high dose definitive radiation therapy via proton beam therapy for selected patients with unresected spine and sacral chordomas the san francisco radiation oncologist not only shared dr kabolizadeh s research paper but also his contact information both tracy and karin learned about the differences between photon and proton radiation they did their homework on treatment options but for tracy it became quite frustrating karin persisted in her fact finding when tracy was down emotionally you have to understand because this cancer is so rare there is limited research available tracy said that was the truly scary part about making any decisions second third and more opinions they conferred with dr kabolizadeh at beaumont in michigan by telephone the couple also traveled to a highly regarded cancer center in new york city it seemed everyone i spoke with had a different opinion said tracy i then determined definitive radiation therapy was the way to go but i had to decide which type and where there was photon therapy available in san francisco but in my research i found out the photon beams don t stop at the tumor and have a greater possibility of affecting surrounding organs too i liked what i heard about the advantages of proton beams precisely targeting the tumor and stopping sparing nearby tissue from harmful radiation deciding on proton therapy several factors went into tracy s decision to choose proton therapy at beaumont hospital in royal oak not only were he and karin impressed with the advanced cancer killing capabilities of the pencil beam proton therapy but also with the expertise of dr kabolizadeh i looked at survivability length of life and quality of life right now i m living life to the fullest and have a beautiful wife we travel entertain friends and are diehard giants fans explained tracy beaumont has the most advanced equipment and someone who is familiar with treatments for my rare cancer i felt that gave me the best chance of success dr kabolizadeh has the vehicle and knows how to drive it every time we spoke he was honest open and candid his candor was refreshing about months after his cancer diagnosis tracy traveled to royal oak in late january to begin his proton treatments on tuesday april he completed his nine weeks of treatment he not only looks forward to watching his beloved giants at at t park but hanging out with his dog neyo and karin looks forward to him shaving the treatment beard he has been growing since his treatments began beaumont proton team second to none i realize i m extremely fortunate to have been able to consider traveling to another state for treatment and live there for two and a half months said tracy i m also fortunate that karin s company has been supportive of her working remotely so she could stay with me and i m so grateful for the tremendous outpouring of love and support we ve received from our family and friends during our stay in michigan that helped keep our spirits high and when asked about his treatment experience tracy remarked every single person that i ve engaged with at beaumont has been a delight they all made what could have been a difficult experience tolerable the facilities are impressive clean and welcoming but the difference is the people best hospital staff i ve ever encountered the team in the proton therapy center is second to none about beaumont s proton therapy center beaumont s center is one of just proton therapy centers in the u s it is the only operational proton therapy center in michigan how proton therapy works proton therapy is a high tech alternative to x ray radiation a scanning beam of proton radiation with online image guidance offers greater precision to destroy cancerous cells sparing adjacent healthy tissue with fewer side effects proton therapy uses positively charged atomic particles traveling up to two thirds the speed of light to fight cancer a cyclotron or particle accelerator creates protons from hydrogen molecules the proton beam is sent to the treatment room through a transport system consisting of magnets called the beam line finally arriving in the gantry a device that rotates around the patient the beam is directed to the patient through a nozzle that targets the tumor while proton therapy is not effective against all cancers it is effective in treating many solid and localized tumors advanced technology our iba proteusone single room treatment system includes precision technologies said dr kabolizadeh intensity modulated proton therapy which combines pencil beam scanning and d cone beam ct can target a tumor within less than a millimeter pencil beam scanning refers to the delivery of protons in a thin beam like a pencil the beam uses back and forth motions to target

titusville n j june prnewswire the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson johnson today announced results from the mercury pe study which showed that people with low risk pulmonary embolism pe treated with xarelto rivaroxaban and discharged from the emergency department had significantly reduced time in the hospital and a median savings of in per patient costs compared to standard of care in patient treatment results from mercury pe which evaluated the benefits of treating patients with low risk pe with xarelto and discharging them early from the emergency department to complete treatment at home were published in academic emergency medicine click to tweet new study shows out patient use of janssen bloodthinner results in cost savings and reduces time in hospital for low risk pe patients every year u s health care systems spend more than two billion dollars to manage patients with pulmonary emboli said principal study investigator w frank peacock md facep facc associate chair and research director emergency medicine baylor college of medicine houston tx by avoiding hospitalizations that are not clinically necessary and transitioning patients with low risk pe to out patient treatment with xarelto we ve seen significant cost savings which could help alleviate the burden on health care systems venous thromboembolism vte includes deep vein thrombosis dvt a blood clot in a deep vein and pe a potentially life threatening condition that occurs when a blood clot travels to the lung of the approximately americans who experience a vte each yeari more than are diagnosed with pe in the emergency departmentii hospitals across the united states have varying protocols for managing pe but standard of care typically requires people to be admitted for treatment which drives up costs and substantially increases hospital acquired conditions and infectionsiii iv while people with more severe pe have higher mortality rates the day mortality rate of low risk pe is less than one percentv click to tweet patients taking janssen blood thinner say in a new study that out patient treatment is less burdensome than the standard of care mercury pe met its primary efficacy endpoint with xarelto leading to significantly reduced time in the hospital due to vte or bleeding within days after randomization compared with the standard of care mean duration of vs hours respectively ci p the mean difference of length of stay between the two groups was hours of note there was no recurrence of vte or vte related death or any significant differences in the bleeding related hospitalizations or physician visits within days from randomization in either group though this outcome should be interpreted with caution as the study was significantly underpowered to detect any such differences we re proud to have pioneered this groundbreaking research which was the first prospective randomized trial to confirm the benefit of discharging patients with low risk pe early from the hospital and completing treatment at home said paul burton md phd facc vice president janssen scientific affairs llc we expect that this xarelto study will prompt physicians to reconsider how patients with low risk pe are managed about mercury pe patients with low risk pe were randomly assigned in a ratio to open label xarelto or standard of care within hours of diagnosis patients randomized to xarelto were discharged from the emergency department within hours and were instructed to take xarelto mg twice daily for days then xarelto mg once daily until the study was completed patients randomized to standard of care were treated per local hospital protocol which could include hospitalization and any u s food and drug administration approved anticoagulant strategy including xarelto researchers also made the following observations about xarelto in this setting the mean length of initial and subsequent hospitalizations for any reason was shorter for patients who were discharged early on xarelto within days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care p hours vs hours respectively within days from randomization compared to those receiving standard of care p hours vs hours respectively there was no major bleeding in either group within days from randomization although two patients reported clinically relevant non major bleeding one in each group there were no deaths due to bleeding in the study overall early discharge on xarelto was markedly less expensive than standard of care the cost associated with the emergency room visit and any subsequent hospitalization at the time of pe diagnosis and the total costs were p and p less with xarelto mercury pe builds on prior research including a june study published in academic emergency medicine showing that patients with low risk pe or dvt when prescribed xarelto and immediately discharged had no recurrent events while on therapy additionally no major or clinically relevant bleeding events were observed a companion study found patients with low risk pe or dvt who were prescribed xarelto had significantly lower medical costs than those admitted and given standard treatment the clinical and economic benefits demonstrated in the mercury pe trial have been confirmed in more than u s patients in a real world study showing that xarelto resulted in a significant one day reduction in hospital length of stay and significantly lower total healthcare costs approximately mercury pe patient satisfaction results patient satisfaction both with out patient and in patient care was also analyzed using likert scales and the anti clot treatment score acts on the likert scales most patients in both groups indicated they were very satisfied with their care but numerically more patients taking xarelto preferred to receive outpatient care percent compared to slightly less than half of patients receiving in patient standard of care percent the acts measured the patient s perspective on the burden of treatment with more patients taking xarelto reporting it was not at all burdensome compared to those receiving standard of care percent vs percent about mercury pe mercury pe was a randomized open label parallel group multicenter trial conducted at hospitals across the u s adult patients who arrived at the emergency department with confirmed low risk pe defined by the absence of any hestia criteria were eligible for enrollment of the patients randomized completed the study in the xarelto group and in the standard of care group patients who did not complete the study were mainly lost to follow up or adverse events analyses were conducted by intention to treat basis regardless of the anticoagulant used the primary efficacy outcome was the total amount of time spent in the hospital in hours for vte or bleeding events in the days after randomization hospital readmissions for reasons unrelated to vte were excluded the primary safety outcome was major bleeding within days secondary efficacy endpoints included day rates of new recurrent vte vte related death unplanned hospital or physician office visits for vte or bleeding total length of initial or subsequent hospitalizations for any reason patient reported satisfaction and total costs of care a secondary safety endpoint was clinically relevant non major bleeding based on international society on thrombosis and haemostasis isth definitions mercury pe also had a few limitations including sample size study enrolled of a planned patients exclusion bias based on subjective evaluation of hemodynamic stability and ability to adhere to protocol and potential bias due to inability to blind patients to their admission status about explorer mercury pe is part of the explorer program which is unmatched by any oral anticoagulant in the factor xa inhibitor class in its size scope and ambition a collaborative effort between janssen and its development partner bayer explorer seeks to generate important clinical evidence on the safety and efficacy of xarelto and its potential role in addressing critical unmet medical needs a number of the studies in the program are designed to seek additional indications or expand the label for xarelto to benefit more patients in need of additional therapies for their cardiovascular disease by the time of its completion more than patients will

philadelphia in a finding that suggests the potential for practice change that would reduce the use of antibiotics in dermatology researchers in the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania have found the diuretic drug spironolactone may be just as effective as antibiotics for the treatment of women s acne the study published this month in the journal of drugs and dermatology found patients who were originally prescribed spironolactone changed to a different drug within one year at almost the same rate as those who were prescribed antibiotics the prescription change is a proxy for ineffectiveness since switching is often the result of treatment failure due to lack of efficacy side effects cost or other factors acne is one of the most common diseases in the world it affects percent of people under the age of but it also regularly impacts adults more than percent of women in the united states are treated for acne between the ages of and while more than percent are treated between the ages of and oral antibiotics are the most common systemic treatment for acne and when combined with the large patient population the result is that dermatologists prescribe the highest level of antibiotics per provider among all medical specialties according to the centers for disease control a fact that contributes to concerns about increased resistance to antibiotics across all fields of medicine it s clear that a safe alternative to oral antibiotics could have a huge benefit and our data show spironolactone may be that alternative said the study s lead author john s barbieri md mba dermatology chief resident at penn david j margolis md phd a professor of dermatology was the study s senior author spironolactone marketed under the name aldactone is currently approved to treat high blood pressure heart failure and conditions that cause people to retain fluid it blocks the effects of male hormones like androgen meaning it s not an option to treat acne in men however those same anti hormonal effects can help prevent acne outbreaks in women as a result some dermatologists use it to treat female acne patients researchers compared data on women and girls taking spironolactone to who were prescribed antibiotics within a year percent of spironolactone patients and percent of antibiotic patients had switched to alternative treatments suggesting each treatment was working at almost the same rate despite the fact that tetracycline class antibiotics are prescribed five times as frequently these numbers suggest dermatologists should consider spironolactone first instead of antibiotics when it comes to women with acne barbieri said in addition to the benefits for antibiotic stewardship barbieri pointed to several studies showing long term oral antibiotic use may be associated with antibiotic resistance lupus inflammatory bowel disease and even colon and breast cancer this indicates spironolactone may have a better safety profile than oral antibiotics which is another factor that makes it such an appealing option barbieri said he also noted spironolactone is less expensive which may be relevant to patients with high deductibles or who are uninsured spironolactone is not approved for the treatment of acne by the u s food and drug administration despite expert opinion supporting its use and barbieri says the findings of this study should be confirmed by a randomized controlled trial that directly compares the two treatment options penn medicine is one of the world s leading academic medical centers

media contact ashley yum patient and caregiver inquiries contact cancer net asco perspective this is one more example of how immunotherapy is making steady gains against a number of cancers immunotherapy has been shown to be effective in other types of lung cancer and now we re seeing encouraging improvements in advanced squamous lung cancer which historically has been very difficult to treat said asco expert david graham md fasco chicago initial findings from a randomized phase iii clinical trial show that patients with advanced squamous non small cell lung cancer nsclc benefit more from initial treatment with pd l targeted immunotherapy atezolizumab tecentriq and chemotherapy than from chemotherapy alone had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone at months cancer had not worsened in twice as many patients who received atezolizumab plus chemotherapy compared to those who only received chemotherapy this benefit was observed across all pd l expressing sub groups the findings will be featured in a press briefing today and presented at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting until now there have been few treatment advances for squamous non small cell lung cancer our findings may provide a new potential treatment option for this type of cancer said lead study author robert m jotte md phd medical director and co chair uson thoracic committee rocky mountain cancer centers in denver co we used to think that chemotherapy just knocked down the patient s immune system and that it would be irrational to combine it with immunotherapy but growing research including this study shows that chemotherapy can help trigger the immune response to the tumor helping the immunotherapy treatment work better squamous nsclc which accounts for of nsclcs is very difficult to treat fewer than of people with advanced squamous nsclc survive a year after diagnosis and less than survive five years recent studies have also found a benefit of combining immunotherapy with chemotherapy in non squamous lung cancer given those findings along with the results from this trial a rapid change in clinical practice is expected noted dr jotte about the study the impower trial enrolled patients with stage iv squamous nsclc tumors were tested for pd l expression but patients were included in the trial regardless of tumor pd l expression level patients with egfr or alk gene changes in the tumor received targeted treatments before starting therapy on this trial the study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatment groups outcomes for only two of the groups however are being reported in this presentation atezolizumab plus chemotherapy carboplatin and nab paclitaxel patients chemotherapy carboplatin and nab paclitaxel patients outcome data for the third treatment group which received atezolizumab with a slightly different chemotherapy regimen carboplatin and paclitaxel are not yet available key findings in this study of all patients regardless of pd l expression had a reduced risk of disease worsening or death compared with those who received chemotherapy alone importantly there was a doubling of progression free survival pfs benefit with this combination at months cancer had not worsened in patients receiving immunotherapy and chemotherapy compared to of those receiving chemotherapy alone improved progression free survival was observed in all groups of patients who received immunotherapy and chemotherapy including those with pd l negative tumors and liver metastases overall survival data are not yet mature this is the first phase iii trial of an immunotherapy based combined modality treatment to show a significant improvement in progression free survival in advanced squamous nsclc according to the authors although the difference between treatment groups is modest a statistically significant improvement shows that overall people with advanced squamous lung cancer can benefit when immunotherapy is added to standard treatment according to the authors although the rate of severe side effects was higher with the combined modality treatment than with chemotherapy alone vs it had a manageable safety profile consistent with known safety risks of the individual therapies the most common side effects of atezolizumab included skin rash colitis and low thyroid hormone at this interim analysis a statistically significant overall survival os benefit was not observed median os was months for atezolizumab plus chemotherapy vs months for chemotherapy alone researchers are continuing to follow patients and anticipate a subsequent analysis later this year next steps more research is needed to determine which patients benefit the most from the addition of immunotherapy to standard chemotherapy the researchers will explore tumor pd l expression and other molecular markers such as tumor mutational burden tmb that may predict whether a patient will benefit from this treatment regimen this study received funding from f hoffmann la roche ltd study at a glance disease squamous nsclc trial phase type phase iii randomized global

titusville n j may prnewswire the janssen pharmaceutical companies of johnson johnson today announced new real world data that showed frail patients with non valvular atrial fibrillation nvaf experienced significantly fewer strokes and systemic emboli when treated with xarelto rivaroxaban over a two year period compared to those taking warfarin specifically long term xarelto use reduced the risk of stroke and systemic embolism by percent and ischemic stroke alone by percent compared to warfarin with no significant increase in major bleeding results from the study which also assessed the efficacy and safety of apixaban and dabigatran each versus warfarin were recently published in the journal of the american heart association click to tweet new two year real world data show janssen blood thinner significantly reduced stroke in frail nvaf patients jaha rwe afib affecting nearly six million americans nvaf increases a person s risk of stroke by five times and accounts for to percent of all strokes i ii frailty is a common clinical syndrome mainly seen in older adults that makes it harder for them to recover from stressful cardiovascular events and vulnerable for poorer health outcomes people with nvaf are four times more likely to be classified as frail than people without nvaf iii and research has shown frail people with nvaf are less likely to receive anticoagulation than non frail people iv v vi there is not widespread consensus on the best way to manage frail patients with nvaf in clinical practice which is why some patients are not treated at all and remain at high risk of having a stroke said craig coleman pharmd professor of pharmacy practice university of connecticut these results show long term rivaroxaban use reduced stroke and systemic embolism in a vulnerable patient group without increasing the risk of major bleeding they also give physicians important insights into a well tolerated effective approach to treat their frail patients with nvaf in the study researchers used u s truven marketscan claims data and identified frail patients with nvaf taking xarelto apixaban or dabigatran each treatment group was matched separately with warfarin users in a ratio and followed for up to two years or until an event insurance disenrollment or end of follow up occurred the primary efficacy outcome was stroke ischemic or hemorrhagic or systemic embolism major bleeding was the primary safety outcome researchers made the following two year observations xarelto was associated with a percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism hr ci and percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone hr ci compared to warfarin was associated with a percent reduction in stroke or systemic embolism hr ci and percent reduction in ischemic stroke alone hr ci compared to warfarin xarelto had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin hr ci had similar rates of major bleeding compared to warfarin hr ci though both apixaban and dabigatran treatment were associated with numerically fewer strokes neither statistically significantly reduced the risk of stroke or systemic embolism at two years compared to warfarin hr ci and hr ci rates of major bleeding were also evaluated for apixaban versus warfarin hr ci and dabigatran versus warfarin hr ci this study adds to the growing body of evidence supporting the positive efficacy and safety profile of xarelto across a broad spectrum of patients with nvaf which now includes the frail population said paul burton md phd facc vice president medical affairs janssen pharmaceuticals inc real world data like this study are critical to informing and helping physicians best treat their patients cardiovascular diseases about the frailty study a total of patients were identified using claims data from u s marketscan databases from november to december these patients were new users of anticoagulant therapy with xarelto apixaban dabigatran or warfarin who had not been previously treated with an anticoagulant they also had at least months of continuous insurance coverage and were considered frail frailty was determined using the johns hopkins claims based frailty indicator scoring algorithm which weighs criteria identifiable in claims data including demographics comorbidities and physical and cognitive dysfunction each eligible xarelto apixaban and dabigatran user was propensity score matched to a warfarin user in a ratio which helped minimize the presence of baseline differences between cohorts a total of patients were included in the retrospective study with taking xarelto apixaban dabigatran and warfarin this study was supported by bayer ag berlin germany real world data have the potential to supplement randomized controlled trial data by providing additional information about how a medicine performs in routine medical practice however they have limitations and cannot be used as stand alone evidence to validate the efficacy and or safety of a treatment additionally it is possible some of the analyses within this specific study may not have been sufficiently powered based on smaller sample sizes about real world xarelto research xarelto is the most studied oral factor xa inhibitor in the world today more than people have been evaluated in published real world research since the approval of xarelto across all approved indications in the u s post marketing studies and registries continue to confirm the safety and efficacy of xarelto in routine clinical use across a broad spectrum of patients there have been no head to head randomized trials directly comparing non vitamin k antagonist oral anticoagulants one recent study revisit us found xarelto is providing an appropriate balance of benefit and risk with respect to ischemic stroke and found a significant reduction in intracranial hemorrhage in routine clinical practice these are two of the most serious types of events physicians work the hardest with their patients to avoid given their potential for irreversible harm what is xarelto xarelto rivaroxaban is a prescription medicine used to reduce the risk of stroke and blood clots in people with

the university of texas at arlington has successfully patented in europe an implantable medical device that attracts and kills circulating cancer cells that was invented by a faculty member this cancer trap can be used for early diagnosis and treatment of metastasized cancer our cancer trap works just like a roach motel where you put in some bait and the roach goes there and dies said liping tang uta bioengineering professor and leader of the research we are putting biological agents in a cancer trap to attract and kill cancer cells this method is effective for both diagnosing and treating metastasis cancer and can be used in combination with traditional chemotherapy and radiation therapy he added currently there are many treatments for primary tumors but they do little to prevent metastasis and stray cancer cells from relocating to another part of the body surgical removal of cancerous tissue also can spur the spread of cancer in the body while there are drugs given to patients after surgery to prevent cancer cells from adhering to each other or other tissues these drugs do not rid the body of cancer cells or collect them to allow an assessment of the patient s status we have made a nano sized device that we can put under the skin using an injection needle to recruit the cancer cells into a small area where we can treat them with less overall side effects to the whole body tang said so the cancer trap is really complementary to current cancer treatments and especially beneficial at the early stages when it is difficult to see if the cancer is spreading as there are few cancer cells we have also found it very effective in late stage cancers to stop the spread of the disease and to prolong lifespan he added liping tang uta bioengineering professor and inventor of the cancer trap the cancer trap works by releasing different chemokines or regulatory proteins to attract circulating cancer cells and then expose them to chemotherapeutic agents to eradicate potential spreading the trap has been tested in the lab and proved effective on many kinds of cancer cells including melanoma prostate cancer breast cancer lung cancer leukemia and esophageal cancer we are hoping to move toward clinical trials in the next few years as this technology could potentially significantly increase the lifespan of cancer patients tang said this work on cancer forms part of a larger program at uta where more than faculty from different colleges and disciplines are developing new solutions to attack this disease with more than million in research expenditures in uta s program for cancer encompasses basic cancer research identification and diagnostics as well as in noninvasive midterm invasive and postoperative therapies uta s multidisciplinary research teams harness proficiencies from across science engineering computer science nursing and kinesiology to tackle the challenges of precision oncology and cancer treatment tang s expertise encompasses a broad area including stem cells tissue engineering nanotechnology biocompatibility biomaterials inflammation infection and fibrosis he has published much of his work in high impact journals including biomaterials journal of clinical investigation proceedings of the national academy of sciences blood journal of experimental medicine and tissue engineering tang is a remarkable innovator and internationally recognized researcher said michael cho uta s chair of bioengineering his work is a clear example of uta s strategic focus on health and the human condition and of the strength of multidisciplinary work,0
newswise multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the united states impacting more than people each year and disproportionatly affecting african american men while patients have access to more quality treatment therapies than ever before the disease is still regarded as an incurable condition that often leads to death for those affected however researchers at the university of alabama at birmingham division of hematology and oncology are leading and currently recruiting for a phase ii clinical trial that intends to provide newly diagonosed multiple myeloma patients an innovative treatment plan the hope is that the therapies will eradicate the disease in a significant proportion of patients and measure disease response more accurately than ever before the clinical trial monoclonal antibody sequential therapy for deep remission in multiple myeloma also known as master utilizes next generation sequencing technology to detect minimal residual disease down to a level of one cancer cell in or to fold more sensitive than traditional methods to evaluate response with a goal of enrolling patients those in the trial will be treated with a combination of anti myeloma agents and immunotherapy that have a proven record of eliminating minimal residual disease including the drug carfilzomib and the monoclonal antibody daratumumab agents that are currently only approved to treat patients whose disease has returned i believe for the first time that we have treatments that are effective enough to make it possible to eradicate multiple myeloma definitively in a substantial proportion of patients along with having the technology to detect that the disease has been targeted and that treatment can be stopped said luciano costa m d ph d scientist at the uab comprehensive cancer center lead of the hematologic malignancy working group and principal investigator of the master study that is what patients want after all a treatment that gives them the possibility of eliminating any trace of the myeloma without having to be on therapy for the rest of their lives it is a bold move but bold moves are what our patients deserve multiple myeloma is the second most common type of blood cancer in the u s impacting more than people each year and disproportionatly affecting african american men this is one of the first trials in multiple myeloma to use minimal residual disease as primary endpoint and the very first one to modify therapy based on achievement of minimal residual disease eradication up until now existing therapies have been developed on trials that assigned treatment for a defined duration of time irrespective of depth or speed of response often followed by maintenance therapy for indefinite duration and with potentially adverse impact on risk of complications and cost as it stands patients with billions of cancer cells in their bodies and patients with true disease eradication will both appear to be in complete remission using current methods to measure disease response to therapy more than improving the results of the initial treatment the master study will treat patients for the necessary time to confirm elimination of minimal residual disease and then discontinue therapy patients will be monitored for relapse at the molecular level before disease becomes again symptomatic in addition to uab s study leadership vanderbilt university medical center duke university medical college of wisconsin university of wisconsin and oregon health and science university are recruiting for the trial as well the master trial is supported by amgen and janseen both with drug and finaincial support,0

action of tivanisiran based on genetic silencing through rna interference rnai is targeted at the treatment of the signs and symptoms of this pathology making it a firm candidate for the treatment of dry eye disease according to ana isabel jiménez director of r d at sylentis we trust in our technology innovative in this field and we hope that tivanisiran will soon become a real alternative for the treatment of millions of people that suffer dry eye disease around the world in this respect jiménez points out that this is a significant step forward in the development of innovative drugs in different therapeutic areas through a novel technology of genetic silencing based on the rna sylentis is a pioneer in rnai research and is one of the few in europe that applies this technology to the field of ophthalmology it also continues with its research on new therapies for ophthalmological and inflammatory illnesses it must be empathized that this pathology affects more than million in spain between and of the population mostly women and almost of these being elderly in this context the phase iii helix study is being carried out in more than hospitals in spain germany estonia portugal slovakia and italy in patients to evaluate the efficacy of this compound in the treatment of the sign and symptoms of dry eye syndrome about rna interference www youtube com watch v ixvsitr about tivanisiran syl tivanisiran is a drug based on rnai that is administered as preservative free eye drops it selectively inhibits production of the transient receptor potential cation channel trpv these receptors are ion channels that mediate the transmission of ocular pain tivanisiran is a small synthetic double stranded rna oligonucleotide sirna with a novel and highly selective mechanism of action non clinical studies conducted by sylentis with syl have demonstrated it has high ability to inhibit this specific target and block the perception of ocular pain in animals tivanisiran is a product under development for the treatment of signs and symptoms related to dry eye syndrome and has the potential to be developed for other pathologies that cause ocular pain corneal lesions refractive surgery etc about rna interference rnai rna interference rnai is a natural cellular process that regulates the expression of certain genes providing a role in innate defense and development in animals and plants this process is used to specifically silence genetic transcripts that encode protein causing diseases the therapeutic application of targeted sirnas is booming given the specificity of gene silencing for a particular protein in a given tissue and the lack of side effects this new approach to drug discovery is a promising technology that is rapidly moving in the translational research space about dry eye syndrome dry eye syndrome is a multifactorial disease of the tear film and ocular surface that produces symptoms of ocular discomfort eyesight disorders and tear film instability with potential damage to the ocular surface dry eye syndrome is accompanied by such symptoms as ocular pain itching stinging and irritation of the eye tissues it is a characteristic disease of developed countries associated with pollution air conditioning the use of contact lenses refractive surgery and continued use of computers moreover the amount and quality of tears decrease with age prevalence is between and among people aged or over and it is more frequent in womeni ii dry eye can be treated with cyclosporin drops or autologous serum but there is as yet no specific product for chronic treatment of the ocular pain related to dry eye syndrome oral analgesics or anaesthetics are used in general however the main treatment consists of artificial tears in the form of drops gel or creams preservative free eye drops have generally been found to offer the best long term response about sylentis,1

scientists at the university of waterloo have developed a new tool to protect women from hiv infection the tool a vaginal implant decreases the number of cells that the hiv virus can target in a woman s genital tract unlike conventional methods of hiv prevention such as condoms or anti hiv drugs the implant takes advantage of some people s natural immunity to the virus hiv infects the body by corrupting t cells that are mobilized by the immune system when the virus enters a person s body when the t cells stay resting and do not attempt to fight the virus they are not infected and the hiv virus is not transmitted between people when the t cells stay resting it s referred to as being immune quiescent we know that some drugs taken orally never make it to the vaginal tract so this implant could provide a more reliable way to encourage t cells not to respond to infection and therefore more reliably and cheaply prevent transmission said emmanuel ho a professor in the school of pharmacy at waterloo what we don t know yet is if this can be a stand alone option for preventing hiv transmission or if it might be best used in conjunction with other prevention strategies we aim to answer these questions with future research ho s implant was inspired by previous research involving sex workers in kenya in kenya ho and research partner keith fowke of the university of manitoba observed that many of these women who had sex with hiv positive clients but did not contract the virus they later found the women possessed t cells that were naturally immune quiescent observing this we asked ourselves if it was possible to pharmacologically induce immune quiescence with medication that was better assured of reaching the point of infection said ho by delivering the medication exactly where it s needed we hoped to increase the chances of inducing immune quiescence the implant is composed of a hollow tube and two pliable arms to hold it in place it contains hydroxychloroquine hcq which is disseminated slowly through the porous material of the tube and absorbed by the walls of the vaginal tract the implants were tested in an animal model and the team observed a significant reduction in t cell activation meaning that the vaginal tract was demonstrating an immune quiescent state the article recently appeared in the journal of controlled release,1

researchers have discovered a new class of drug that has the potential to help cancer patients who no longer respond to existing therapies the drug may not become available to patients for a number of years yet but researchers believe that if clinical trials are successful it could be used to tackle a variety of treatment resistant cancers patients with breast cancer for example frequently become resistant to existing hormone based treatments leading to the disease becoming fatal in a bid to come up with new forms of treatment that work in a distinct way from established ones chemists biologists and clinicians at imperial college london collaborated on creating a new drug the properties of which are reported in the journal molecular cancer therapeutics the team of scientists at imperial was funded by cancer research uk the drug was then developed by imperial in collaboration with emory university in the usa early lab based tests of icec were successful in targeting resistant breast cancers and indicated minimal side effects icec was then licenced to carrick therapeutics who developed it into a molecule named ct which they have taken to early stage clinical trials in less than two years the first patient was given the drug in november as part of carrick s a phase i clinical trial to assess its safety and how well it can be tolerated the trial is still ongoing so results are not available yet professor charles coombes from the department of surgery cancer said treatment resistant tumours represent a significant threat for patients as once a cancer stops responding to treatments there is increasingly little clinicians can do drugs such as these could help to shift the balance back in favour of the patients potentially providing a new option to patients for who existing treatments no longer work professor tony barrett from the department of chemistry said this work is the result of extensive collaboration between chemists biologists and clinicians which has helped to bring a new treatment from discovery to clinical testing in record time streamlining the process the drug targets an enzyme called cdk involved in directing cells through their lifecycle which consists of growth dna replication and cell division cdk is also involved in the process of transcription a vital step in gene expression the creation of proteins to carry out cell functions particular cancers such as treatment resistant breast cancers have a unique dependence on transcription meaning targeting cdk may be particularly effective by inhibiting transcription icec shuts down the ability of the cancer to spread as well as breast cancers cancers such as acute myeloid leukaemia and small cell lung cancer are particularly transcription dependent so icec may work well for these too especially where they have become resistant to other treatments the discovery of the drug was spurred by an initial meeting between professor anthony barrett from the department of chemistry and oncologist professor charles coombes from the department of surgery cancer professor simak ali also from the department of surgery cancer was working on understanding the action of cdk in treatment resistant breast cancer professors coombes and ali suggested cdk as a drug target leading the collaboration to attempt to design a molecule that would inhibit its action from early attempts a large collaborative team was eventually founded for drug discovery from bench to bedside directed by dr matthew fuchter in the department of chemistry possible compounds for cdk inhibition were modelled using computational drug design aided by collaboration with emory university ultimately a candidate molecule called icec suppressed tumour growth in a wide range of cancer types in lab tests in addition laboratory studies showed icec worked better in combination with traditional hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer cells which have not yet become resistant it is this molecule in oral pill form that was taken forward by carrick as ct and is currently in phase i clinical trials if the phase i trial proves successful the compound must pass further stages of trial over the next few years before it becomes available to patients early funding for the study came from the engineering and physical sciences research council epsrc and a major contribution of whole project funding was from cancer research uk licensing of the technology to carrick therapeutics was led by cancer research uk s commercial partnerships team and imperial innovations the technology transfer office of imperial with support from emory university dr iain foulkes cancer research uk s executive director of research and innovation said it s exciting to see how cancer research uk s partnerships with both academia and industry are bringing urgently needed new tests and treatments to patients drug resistance continues to be a major challenge across many cancer types so it s vital that we explore new ways to tackle tumours that have stopped responding to standard therapies we hope that this promising new class of drug will offer more options to patients who have few left available to them and help more people survive their cancer,1
adding the monoclonal antibody drug trastuzumab already used to treat certain breast cancers to the chemotherapy regimen of women with a rare form of uterine cancer lengthens the amount of time their tumors are kept from growing according to johns hopkins medicine researchers conducting a small phase ii trial of the regimen testing its safety and value the results of the trial published online ahead of print on march in the journal of clinical oncology show that the drug extended the length of time to tumor progression by four to eight months in the seven year trial the researchers say this may lead to new national guidelines for treating this cancer subtype known as uterine serous carcinoma uterine serous carcinoma makes up less than percent of all cancers of the endometrium or lining of the womb diagnosed in the united states each year but it accounts for more than a third of the endometrial cancer deaths annually the aggressive carcinomas often don t cause symptoms until they ve begun to spread throughout the body as a result the average time that standard chemotherapy and surgical treatments can keep the tumor from growing or spreading known as progression free survival is only about eight months the fact that these tumors grow rapidly but also have a propensity to spread to lymph nodes and other organs very early is a double whammy for women says amanda fader m d associate professor of gynecology and obstetrics at the johns hopkins university school of medicine and first author of the new study fader and her colleagues knew that about percent of all uterine serous carcinomas test positive for her neu a receptor protein that is also overexpressed in about percent of all breast cancers trastuzumab binds to and blocks her neu keeping it from driving tumor growth and has been shown to be effective in so called her positive breast cancers from august through march fader alessandro santin m d professor of gynecology and obstetrics at yale university and collaborators at other cancer treatment centers in the u s randomly assigned women with uterine serous carcinoma being seen at the participating institutions to receive either the standard chemotherapeutic regimen a combination of the drugs carboplatin and paclitaxel or those drugs plus trastuzumab some of the patients had stage or uterine serous carcinoma known as advanced disease and had recurrent uterine serous carcinoma all tested positive for the her neu receptor among all patients the controls receiving only the standard carboplatin and paclitaxel combination had an average progression free survival time of eight months and the who received trastuzumab in addition had an average progression free survival time of months however the difference was even more profound in the patients with advanced disease whose progression free survival time went from an average of months to months with the addition of trastuzumab even an improvement of a few months may be quite meaningful for women with these cancers says fader who is also affiliated with the sidney kimmel comprehensive cancer center at johns hopkins among patients with recurrent disease progression free survival time increased from an average of six months to months the difference fader says may be that these patients have been heavily treated in the past are more likely to have overall poorer health and are more likely to have mutated or heterogeneous tumors or tumors with different levels of her expression follow up studies of the women who remain alive who now number continue the researchers say to track the impact of trastuzumab on overall survival time even after tumor progression but the results of the trial they add were strong enough to warrant submission to the national comprehensive cancer network which guides the design of standard treatment plans around the country fader cautions that a larger study of the drug combination or other combinations is needed to confirm the findings and potentially extend survival even more she notes that using trastuzumab to selectively treat uterine serous carcinoma that express her neu is part of a broader trend at johns hopkins and other cancer centers to use the tools of tailored therapy or precision medicine based on the molecular and genetic makeup of tumors and patients other authors of the paper are dana m roque

washington march prnewswire vanda pharmaceuticals inc vanda nasdaq vnda today announced that hetlioz a circadian regulator demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful benefits in nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder hetlioz is currently approved in the us and europe for the treatment of non hour sleep wake disorder a rare and chronic circadian rhythm sleep disorder jet lag disorder is a common circadian disorder frequently observed in millions of travelers who cross multiple time zones jet lag disorder is characterized by nighttime sleep disruption a decrease in daytime alertness and impairment to social and occupational functioning the clinical efficacy results reported today are from the jet phase iii clinical study the jet study in the jet study healthy volunteers were admitted to a sleep unit and were subjected to a circadian challenge of an hours advance to their usual bedtime the jet study design induced the circadian challenge experienced by travelers who cross times zones which leads to jet lag disorder this clinical design allowed for the study of hetlioz without the confounding effects of sleep deprivation and variable light conditions results from the jet study showed significant and clinically meaningful effects of hetlioz mg on the primary endpoint of the study as well as multiple secondary endpoints the pre specified primary endpoint was the amount of sleep time in the first two thirds of the night secondary endpoints included measures of sleep parameters tst lps waso and next day alertness kss and vas table table summary of primary and key secondary endpoint results assessment endpoint hetlioz placebo difference p value summary p value detail psg tst p e minutes tst full p e lps p e waso p e kss average p e vas average p e primary endpoint the results of the jet study shown above demonstrate the effectiveness of hetlioz in treating jet lag disorder the magnitude of the total sleep time benefit of minutes improvement over placebo is significant and clinically meaningful the demonstration of benefits in measurements of next day alertness on both kss and vas is meaningful and it underscores the ability of hetlioz to address both nighttime and daytime symptoms of jet lag disorder vanda previously reported on the jet study that examined the effects of hetlioz in a circadian challenge of hours advance of the subjects usual bedtime the results of that study were published in the lancet in the observation that hetlioz is effective in treating the symptoms caused by an abrupt advance of the circadian cycle of a magnitude of or hours suggests that hetlioz will be an effective therapeutic tool in the treatment of individuals that experience symptoms of jet lag hetlioz will be potentially useful under circumstances of rapid eastward transmeridian travel experienced by frequent travelers the rapid deployment of military troops and any circumstances that will necessitate the abrupt phase advance of the sleep wake cycle jet lag disorder affects millions of individuals annually who cross multiple time zones during their travel jet lag disorder symptoms are more severe during eastward travel it is reported that more than million us residents make trips abroad each year to overseas destinations of these approximately million travel to destinations in europe middle east and asia it is also reported that approximately million travel in business or first class we are extremely pleased with the outcome of this study which establishes the utility of hetlioz in the treatment of jet lag disorder as hetlioz was shown to overcome a significant circadian challenge of an hour phase advance this challenge is equivalent to eastward travel across time zones as experienced for example on travel from los angeles to london washington dc to moscow paris to tokyo or london to singapore hetlioz improved both nighttime sleep and next day alertness potentially offering significant benefits to millions of travelers said mihael h polymeropoulos md vanda s president and ceo vanda intends to seek marketing approval for the use of hetlioz in the treatment of jet lag disorder vanda believes

people with stage iii colon cancer who regularly eat nuts are at significantly lower risk of cancer recurrence and mortality than those who don t according to a new large study led by researchers at yale cancer center the findings were published today in the journal of clinical oncology the study followed participants in a clinical trial for a median of years after they were treated with surgery and chemotherapy those who regularly consumed at least two one ounce servings of nuts each week demonstrated a improvement in disease free survival and a improvement in overall survival further analysis of this cohort revealed that disease free survival increased by among the subgroup of nut consumers who ate tree nuts rather than peanuts said charles s fuchs m d director of yale cancer center and senior author of the study tree nuts include almonds walnuts hazelnuts cashews and pecans among others in contrast peanuts are actually in the legume family of foods these findings are in keeping with several other observational studies that indicate that a slew of healthy behaviors including increased physical activity keeping a healthy weight and lower intake of sugar and sweetened beverages improve colon cancer outcomes said temidayo fadelu m d a postdoctoral fellow at dana farber cancer institute and lead author of the paper the results highlight the importance of emphasizing dietary and lifestyle factors in colon cancer survivorship additionally the researchers emphasized the study highlighted connections between biological mechanisms that worsen disease not just in colon cancer but in certain chronic illnesses such as type diabetes many previous studies have reported that nuts among other health benefits may help to reduce insulin resistance a condition in which the body has difficulty processing the insulin hormone insulin resistance leads to unhealthy levels of sugar in the blood and is often a predecessor to type diabetes and related illnesses earlier research among patients with colon cancer has revealed worse outcomes among those with lifestyle factors such as obesity lack of exercise and a diet with high levels of carbohydrates that heighten insulin resistance and quickly raise levels of blood sugar these studies support the hypothesis that behaviors that make you less insulin resistant including eating nuts seem to improve outcomes in colon cancer fuchs said however we don t know yet what exactly about nuts is beneficial nuts also might play a positive role by satisfying hunger with less intake of carbohydrates or other foods associated with poor outcomes fuchs noted patients may not be eating nuts due to concerns about the high fat content said fuchs for example a one ounce serving of about almonds holds about calories including grams of fat people ask me if increasing nut consumption will lead to obesity which leads to worse outcomes he said but what s really interesting is that in our studies and across the scientific literature in general regular consumers of nuts tend to be leaner dietary changes can make a difference an earlier analysis of diets in the same patient cohort by fuchs and his colleagues found a significant link between coffee consumption and reduced recurrence and mortality in colon cancer when fuchs advises his patients about lifestyle choices first and foremost i talk about avoiding obesity exercising regularly and staying away from a high carbohydrate diet he said then we talk about things like coffee and nuts if you like coffee or nuts enjoy them and if you don t there are many other helpful steps you can take overall we are working to apply the same rigorous science to the understanding of diet and lifestyles in the colon cancer patient population that we apply to defining new drugs fuchs said co corresponding authors on the paper are jeffrey meyerhardt m d of dana farber and ying bao m d of brigham and women s hospital lead funding for the research was provided by the national cancer institute support also came from private sponsors including pfizer oncology and the international tree nut council nutrition research education foundation the private sponsors did not participate in the design conduct or analysis of the study or in review or approval of the paper,1
a treatment that improves the lives of nearly million people with rheumatoid arthritis might one day originate from scorpion venom a group of researchers led by dr christine beeton at baylor college of medicine has found that one of the hundreds of components in scorpion venom can reduce the severity of the disease in animal models without inducing side effects associated with similar treatments the study appears in the journal of pharmacology and experimental therapeutics rheumatoid arthritis is an autoimmune disease one in which the immune system attacks its own body in this case it affects the joints said beeton associate professor of molecular physiology and biophysics and member dan l duncan comprehensive cancer center at baylor college of medicine cells called fibroblast like synoviocytes fls play a major role in the disease as they grow and move from joint to joint they secrete products that damage the joints and attract immune cells that cause inflammation and pain as damage progresses the joints become enlarged and are unable to move current treatments target the immune cells involved in the disease and none are specific for fls beeton and her colleagues studied fls looking for an achilles heel that would allow them to prevent or stop them from damaging the joints in previous work we identified a potassium channel on fls of patients with rheumatoid arthritis and found that the channel was very important for the development of the disease beeton said we wanted to find a way to block the channel to stop the cells damaging the joints potassium channels work by opening gates on the surface of cells that allow potassium ions small charged atoms to flow in and out of the cell the flow of ions through the channels is necessary for the cells to carry out many of their essential functions animals such as scorpions have venoms that block potassium and other ion channels they use the venoms to paralyze and kill prey decades ago scientists discovered this and realized that if handled correctly venoms also might have medicinal applications scorpion venom may lead to improved treatments for rheumatoid arthritis scorpion venom has hundreds of different components one of the components in the venom of the scorpion called buthus tamulus specifically blocks the potassium channel of fls and not the channels in other cells such as those of the nervous system said first author dr mark tanner a graduate student in the beeton lab during the development of this project here we investigated whether this venom component called iberiotoxin would be able to specifically block the fls potassium channel and reduce the severity of the rheumatoid arthritis in rat models of the disease when the researchers treated rat models of the disease with iberiotoxin they stopped the progression of the disease in some cases they reversed the signs of established disease meaning that the animals had better joint mobility and less inflammation in their joints in addition treatment with iberiotoxin did not induce side effects such as tremors and incontinence observed when treating with another channel blocker called paxilline it was very exciting to see that iberiotoxin is very specific for the potassium channel in fls and that it did not seem to affect the channels in other types of cells which might explain the lack of tremors and incontinence tanner said although these results are promising much more research needs to be conducted before we can use scorpion venom components to treat rheumatoid arthritis beeton said we think that this venom component iberiotoxin can become the basis for developing a new treatment for rheumatoid arthritis in the future other contributors of this work include michael w pennington brayden h chamberlain redwan huq elizabeth j gehrmann teresina laragione and pércio s gulko the contributors are affiliated with one or more of the following institutions baylor college of medicine peptides international inc and icahn school of medicine at mount sinai this work was supported by the arthritis foundation grant and the national institutes of health grants gm ai ar hl ca and hg,1
for immediate release february the u s food and drug administration today permitted marketing of the first blood test to evaluate mild traumatic brain injury mtbi commonly referred to as concussion in adults the fda reviewed and authorized for marketing the banyan brain trauma indicator in fewer than months as part of its breakthrough devices program most patients with a suspected head injury are examined using a neurological scale called the point glasgow coma scale followed by a computed tomography or ct scan of the head to detect brain tissue damage or intracranial lesions that may require treatment however a majority of patients evaluated for mtbi concussion do not have detectable intracranial lesions after having a ct scan availability of a blood test for concussion will help health care professionals determine the need for a ct scan in patients suspected of having mtbi and help prevent unnecessary neuroimaging and associated radiation exposure to patients helping to deliver innovative testing technologies that minimize health impacts to patients while still providing accurate and reliable results to inform appropriate evaluation and treatment is an fda priority today s action supports the fda s initiative to reduce unnecessary radiation exposure from medical imaging an effort to ensure that each patient is getting the right imaging exam at the right time with the right radiation dose said fda commissioner scott gottlieb m d a blood testing option for the evaluation of mtbi concussion not only provides health care professionals with a new tool but also sets the stage for a more modernized standard of care for testing of suspected cases in addition availability of a blood test for mtbi concussion will likely reduce the ct scans performed on patients with concussion each year potentially saving our health care system the cost of often unnecessary neuroimaging tests according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention in there were approximately million tbi related emergency department visits hospitalizations and deaths in the u s of these cases tbi contributed to the deaths of nearly people tbi is caused by a bump blow or jolt to the head or a penetrating head injury that disrupts the brain s normal functioning its severity may range from mild to severe with percent of tbis that occur each year being assessed as mtbis or concussions a majority of patients with concussion symptoms have a negative ct scan potential effects of tbi can include impaired thinking or memory movement sensation or emotional functioning a blood test to aid in concussion evaluation is an important tool for the american public and for our service members abroad who need access to quick and accurate tests said jeffrey shuren m d director of the fda s center for devices and radiological health the fda s review team worked closely with the test developer and the u s department of defense to expedite a blood test for the evaluation of mtbi that can be used both in the continental u s as well as foreign u s laboratories that service the american military the brain trauma indicator works by measuring levels of proteins known as uch l and gfap that are released from the brain into blood and measured within hours of head injury levels of these blood proteins after mtbi concussion can help predict which patients may have intracranial lesions visible by ct scan and which won t being able to predict if patients have a low probability of intracranial lesions can help health care professionals in their management of patients and the decision to perform a ct scan test results can be available within to hours the fda evaluated data from a multi center prospective clinical study of individual blood samples from adults with suspected mtbi concussion and reviewed the product s performance by comparing mtbi concussion blood tests results with ct scan results the brain trauma indicator was able to predict the presence of intracranial lesions on a ct scan percent of the time and those who did not have intracranial lesions on a ct scan percent of the time these findings indicate that the test can reliably predict the absence of intracranial lesions and that health care professionals can incorporate this tool into the standard of care for patients to rule out the need for a ct scan in at least one third of patients who are suspected of having mtbi the brain trauma indicator was reviewed under the fda s de novo premarket review pathway a regulatory pathway for some low to moderate risk devices that are novel and for which there is no prior legally marketed device the fda is permitting marketing of the brain trauma indicator to banyan biomarkers inc the fda an agency within the u s department of health and human

newswise toronto on february a deceased donor kidney has been preserved and kept healthy outside the body in a device that mimics the body s physiological functions and successfully transplanted into a human for the first time in north america the technique unique solution and device are part of a phase i clinical trial at toronto general hospital tg university health network uhn assessing the safety of the device with subsequent phases examining its efficacy kidneys are the most frequently transplanted solid organ but a continuing shortage of donor kidneys impacts wait times and quality of life of those waiting for a transplant one way to address this gap by the transplant community worldwide has been to extend the criteria of those donor kidneys used for transplantation but these extended criteria organs those from older donors or from donors who have two or more risk factors do not tolerate current cold storage methods for organ preservation well this can result in greater injury to the kidney or in a sleepy kidney which functions poorly at the beginning requiring dialysis until it recovers days or weeks later this early delayed function also impacts its longer term survival in ontario about per cent of all transplanted kidneys are expanded criteria donor kidneys this means donors are on average older than years or younger than years and likely have hypertension higher bmi body mass index diabetes or died due to stroke ex vivo organ perfusion is an innovative organ preservation technique that seeks to overcome the limitations of current cold storage method of preservation developed in the laboratory of uhn transplant surgeon dr markus selzner with the help of uhn transplant surgeons drs david grant and anand ghanekar as well as drs lisa robinson and darius bagli from the hospital for sick children sickkids it took four years to perfect the solution for the donor kidney and to modify the heart lung machine for use in the warm perfusion technique this technology has advantages over the usual cold storage method in which a deceased donor kidney is cooled on ice to about four degrees celsius with no oxygen slowing down its metabolism and inhibiting the repair process the kidney cannot survive longer than hours in cold preservation the new warm preservation technique avoids the damage of cold storage and instead allows the donor organ to improve and repair itself potentially leading to better outcomes for patients using a heart lung bypass machine with customized tubing adapted to the kidney s smaller blood vessels and a specially blended preservation solution of blood nutrients minerals amino acids oxygen glucose antibiotics and drugs surgeons nurses and perfusionists at tg prepared a deceased donor kidney in a transplant operating room to be placed in a warm preservation solution before transplantation into a patient in late november the aim was to enhance kidney function minimize injury and avoid a sleepy kidney from an extended criteria kidney about per cent of deceased donor kidneys do not work immediately requiring longer hospitals stays for the patients and dialysis zhao xiao received the deceased donor kidney which was placed on the device for hours at body temperature i feel great says xiao through an interpreter he was able to get up and walk two day after his transplant xiao says he was happy to volunteer to become the first patient to receive a kidney that was improved by the new technology this can make a difference to other patients so i am glad to be the first one helping them with my experience as soon as the donor kidney was reattached to the patient it turned ruby red and started to pour out urine indicating that it was functioning well it is a champion says an elated dr selzner who has done about kidney transplants in the past years it behaved like a normal kidney despite it being an extended criteria donor kidney he points out blood tests within hours showed that the kidney was removing wastes and excess fluid from the blood normally since the kidney did not struggle after transplant there is a greater likelihood that its long term outcome will be better he adds this technique will change the landscape of organ donation by improving organ preservation allowing us to better assess and regenerate the donor organ on the device before we transplant it into a patient we will know how healthy that organ is before the transplant operation says dr markus selzner co investigator of the clinical trial dr selzner a clinician scientist at the toronto general hospital research institute and associate professor of surgery at the university of toronto previously modified the preservation solution and supervised the research on a successful warm perfusion technique for the deceased donor liver organ working on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my professional career says dr lisa robinson division head of nephrology at sickkids it is exciting to see this work be transformed from an idea to experimental research and now to directly impacting patients even with the shortage of donor organs we have to decline some of our donor organs because of the damage they sustain in the retrieval process says dr david grant surgical director of the multi organ transplant program uhn he is also co investigator of the clinical trial and transplanted the donor kidney which was on the modified heart lung bypass machine into the recipient this new technology can help us answer the critical question what s the best way to improve function and recover and repair the kidney before transplantation to get the best results for our patients dr grant who is also professor of surgery at the university of toronto emphasized that high impact research projects such as this require strong collaborative teams including researchers surgical residents nurses canadian blood services perfusionists colleagues at sickkids working together on experimental and clinical trials uhn is one of the few places in the world where you can have a good idea and then find the right people to make something like this happen other collaborators on the research and clinical trial at uhn include drs joseph kim and anand ghanekar co leads of the kidney transplant program at uhn and transplant nephrologist dr istvan mucsi dr grant also praised the strong support and efforts of trillium gift of life which co ordinates organ and tissue donation across ontario in helping to ensure that the transplant team could begin their clinical trials with this new technique the technique of warm organ perfusion outside the body was pioneered by the toronto lung transplant program at tg in by drs shaf keshavjee and marcelo cypel to better treat repair and assess high risk donor lungs outside the body the lungs are placed in a protective dome in which a system continuously pumps a bloodless solution of oxygen proteins and nutrients into the injured donor lungs mimicking normal physiological conditions this makes it possible for the injured cells to begin repairing themselves and sets the stage for more sophisticated repair techniques to be applied to donor lungs since there has been an unprecedented per cent increase in lung transplants at tg as a result of this system at any point in time there are about patients waiting for a transplant in ontario about people wait for a kidney transplant across the province usually about four years about five per cent of people on kidney waiting lists die every year research for the ex vivo kidney perfusion project was supported by the canadian national transplant research program cntrp a national research network designed to increase organ and tissue donation in canada and enhance

los angeles jan clot removal may be beneficial up to hours following stroke in carefully selected patients but every hour delayed after symptoms begin may be associated with more disability according to preliminary research presented at the american stroke association s international stroke conference a world premier meeting dedicated to the science and treatment of cerebrovascular disease for researchers and clinicians the international dawn trial previously demonstrated that patients with a small area of irreversible brain damage and a large area of brain at jeopardy of being lost if the clot remains are more likely to recover with minimal disability if the clot is removed up to hours after symptoms begin or were noticed it is already well established that the benefit of clot removal declines each hour during the first hours after symptoms are detected in the current analysis of treatment between and hours after symptoms were observed or after the person was last seen to be well researchers found each hour delay reduces the chance of recovery with minimal or no disability by percent and treatment remains beneficial through hours with patients who had their clots removed being percent more likely to have minimal or no disability days later but the overall effect of treatment declines with time the current results demonstrate the importance of prompt imaging and treatment of patients with clot caused stroke even in those who wake up having experienced a stroke or who for other reasons are not identified in the first few hours after the onset of symptoms stryker neuroendovascular funded the dawn trial raul g nogueira m d emory university school of medicine atlanta georgia presentation location room additional resources available downloadable b roll animation and images to this news tip are on the right column of the tip link newsroom heart org news prompt clot grabbing treatment produces better stroke outcomes preview d c c ca b for more news at aha international stroke conference follow us on twitter heartnews isc statements and conclusions of study authors that are presented at american heart association scientific meetings are solely those of the study authors and do not necessarily reflect association policy or position the association makes no representation or warranty as to their accuracy or reliability the association receives funding primarily from individuals foundations and corporations including pharmaceutical device manufacturers and other companies also make donations and fund specific association programs and events the association has strict policies to prevent these relationships from influencing the science content revenues from pharmaceutical and device corporations are available at heart org corporatefunding about the american stroke association the american stroke association is devoted to saving people from stroke the no cause of death in the world and a leading cause of serious disability we team with millions of volunteers to fund innovative research fight for stronger public health policies and provide lifesaving tools and information to prevent and treat stroke the dallas based association officially launched in as a division of the american heart association to learn more or to get involved call stroke or visit strokeassociation org follow us on facebook and twitter,1
newswise lovers of indian food give yourselves a second helping daily consumption of a certain form of curcumin the substance that gives indian curry its bright color improved memory and mood in people with mild age related memory loss according to the results of a study conducted by ucla researchers the research published online jan in the american journal of geriatric psychiatry examined the effects of an easily absorbed curcumin supplement on memory performance in people without dementia as well as curcumin s potential impact on the microscopic plaques and tangles in the brains of people with alzheimer s disease found in turmeric curcumin has previously been shown to have anti inflammatory and antioxidant properties in lab studies it also has been suggested as a possible reason that senior citizens in india where curcumin is a dietary staple have a lower prevalence of alzheimer s disease and better cognitive performance exactly how curcumin exerts its effects is not certain but it may be due to its ability to reduce brain inﬂammation which has been linked to both alzheimer s disease and major depression said dr gary small director of geriatric psychiatry at ucla s longevity center and of the geriatric psychiatry division at the semel institute for neuroscience and human behavior at ucla and the study s first author the double blind placebo controlled study involved adults between the ages of and years who had mild memory complaints participants were randomly assigned to receive either a placebo or milligrams of curcumin twice daily for months all subjects received standardized cognitive assessments at the start of the study and at six month intervals and monitoring of curcumin levels in their blood at the start of the study and after months thirty of the volunteers underwent positron emission tomography or pet scans to determine the levels of amyloid and tau in their brains at the start of the study and after months the people who took curcumin experienced significant improvements in their memory and attention abilities while the subjects who received placebo did not small said in memory tests the people taking curcumin improved by percent over the months those taking curcumin also had mild improvements in mood and their brain pet scans showed significantly less amyloid and tau signals in the amygdala and hypothalamus than those who took placebos the amygdala and hypothalamus are regions of the brain that control several memory and emotional functions four people taking curcumin and two taking placebos experienced mild side effects such as abdominal pain and nausea the researchers plan to conduct a follow up study with a larger number of people that study will include some people with mild depression so the scientists can explore whether curcumin also has antidepressant effects the larger sample also would allow them to analyze whether curcumin s memory enhancing effects vary according to people s genetic risk for alzheimer s their age or the extent of their cognitive problems these results suggest that taking this relatively safe form of curcumin could provide meaningful cognitive benefits over the years said small ucla s parlow solomon professor on aging the paper s authors in addition to small are prabha siddarth dr zhaoping li karen miller linda ercoli natacha emerson jacqueline martinez koon pong wong jie liu dr david merrill dr stephen chen susanne henning nagichettiar satyamurthy sung cheng huang dr david heber and jorge barrio all of ucla the study was supported by the ahmanson foundation the marshall and margherite mccomb foundation the mcmahan foundation bob and marion wilson the fran and ray stark foundation fund for alzheimer s disease research the u s department of energy and the national institutes of health theravalues corp provided the curcumin and placebos for the trial as well as funds for laboratory testing and for small s travel to present preliminary findings at the alzheimer s association international conference see original study,0
a new study suggests that continuous movement while sitting may increase metabolic rate more than standing at a desk craig horswill clinical associate professor of kinesiology and nutrition at the university of illinois at chicago says the study adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests strategies for increasing non exercise active thermogenesis defined as spontaneous activity unrelated to a fitness routine are needed to help overcome the detrimental effects of prolonged sitting sitting has been identified as a risk factor for early mortality independent of the presence of a disease such as cancer or diabetes up to percent of deaths have been attributed to sitting alone sitting is bad for our health but it is a big part of daily life for many people said horswill an expert in exercise and metabolism in uic s college of applied health sciences exercise is a good way to counteract the negative effects of sitting but just incorporating physical activity into one part of our day may not be enough to overcome the damage caused by prolonged sitting and an otherwise sedentary lifestyle because the workday is a major contributor to sedentary behavior with more than percent of workers in the u s reporting more than hours each day tactics that promote workstation activity have emerged in recent years including standing desks as well as dynamic pedal and treadmill workstations horswill and his colleagues compared the metabolic rate produced by three workstations seated at a desk seated at a desk equipped with a device that stimulates leg movement and standing at a desk the device which is commercially available was a movable footrest suspended from the underside of the desk which enabled the feet to swing twist or teeter participants in the study familiarized themselves with the workstations during one visit on a second visit researchers collected metabolic rate and heart rate data during three progressive stages seated seated with the device and standing each stage was minutes the researchers found that modest movement while seated elevated the metabolic rate more than sitting and more than standing by and percent respectively and had no detrimental effect on cognitive function the findings are published in work a journal affiliated with the canadian association of occupational therapists and endorsed by the international ergonomics association these results suggest that non exercise active thermogenesis which we call neat can increase movement and calorie burning and may have the potential to impact health said horswill the senior author on the study we expected to see the metabolic rate increase with each progressive stage but instead found that metabolic rates from movement while seated were either equal to or higher than rates while standing horswill says the study needs to be further validated but that the findings should be especially applicable to individuals poised to benefit from neat but unable to access popular standing desks because of injury disability or discomfort this is more evidence that neat something everyone can do throughout the day may be an important strategy for improving health and even reducing early death said horswill haley scott and danel voorhees are co authors on the paper active ideas llc which offers the hovr device used in study funded the research,1

ann arbor new research from the university of michigan life sciences institute has determined how a common holiday spice cinnamon might be enlisted in the fight against obesity scientists had previously observed that cinnamaldehyde an essential oil that gives cinnamon its flavor appeared to protect mice against obesity and hyperglycemia but the mechanisms underlying the effect were not well understood researchers in the lab of jun wu research assistant professor at the lsi wanted to better understand cinnamaldehyde s action and determine whether it might be protective in humans too scientists were finding that this compound affected metabolism said wu who also is an assistant professor of molecular and integrative physiology at the u m medical school so we wanted to figure out how what pathway might be involved what it looked like in mice and what it looked like in human cells their findings which appear in the december issue of the journal metabolism indicated that cinnamaldehyde improves metabolic health by acting directly on fat cells or adipocytes inducing them to start burning energy through a process called thermogenesis wu and her colleagues tested human adipocytes from volunteers representing a range of ages ethnicities and body mass indices when the cells were treated with cinnamaldehyde the researchers noticed increased expression of several genes and enzymes that enhance lipid metabolism they also observed an increase in ucp and fgf which are important metabolic regulatory proteins involved in thermogenesis adipocytes normally store energy in the form of lipids this long term storage was beneficial to our distant ancestors who had much less access to high fat foods and thus a much greater need to store fat that fat could then be used by the body in times of scarcity or in cold temperatures which induce adipocytes to convert stored energy into heat it s only been relatively recently that energy surplus has become a problem wu said throughout evolution the opposite energy deficiency has been the problem so any energy consuming process usually turns off the moment the body doesn t need it with the rising obesity epidemic researchers like wu have been looking for ways to prompt fat cells to activate thermogenesis turning those fat burning processes back on wu believes that cinnamaldehyde may offer one such activation method and because it is already used widely in the food industry it might be easier to convince patients to stick to a cinnamon based treatment than to a traditional drug regimen cinnamon has been part of our diets for thousands of years and people generally enjoy it wu said so if it can help protect against obesity too it may offer an approach to metabolic health that is easier for patients to adhere to now before anyone goes dumping tons of extra cinnamon in their egg nog in hopes of keeping holiday season pounds at bay wu cautioned that further study is needed to determine how best to harness cinnamaldehyde s metabolic benefits without causing adverse side effects the research was supported by the human frontier science program edward mallinckrodt jr foundation national institutes of health and american heart association other study authors were juan jiang margo emont heejin jun xiaona qiao jiling liao and dong il kim all of u m the study is titled cinnamaldehyde induces fat cell autonomous thermogenesis and metabolic reprogramming doi j metabol,1

the subjects involved in the study consumed at least three portions of chicken and eggs per week that were naturally enriched with omega polyunsaturated fatty acids pufa the same nutrients found in oily fish the results from the clinical study saw an increase in omega pufa levels in blood and a positive shift in what is described as the omega index a test that measures the amount of the omega fatty acids docosahexaenoic acid dha and eicosapentaenoic acid epa in red blood cell membranes which reflects the levels in your heart and other tissues a low omega index indicates a heightened risk of heart and brain disease the study showed that consuming omega enriched chicken and eggs resulted in a halving of the number of subjects with such a high risk omega index the chicken meat and eggs used in the study came from birds offered omegapro a sustainable and algae based source of omega pufa developed by devenish the findings were presented by professor alice stanton of the royal college of surgeons in ireland greater consumption of oily fish has long been linked to a reduced incidence of heart attack stroke diabetes and cancer and improved brain health vision muscle and joint health said professor alice stanton international guidelines recommend eating oily fish at least once per week however many people do not eat fish at all and less than of the world s population have optimal omega pufa levels therefore in this project we studied the recently developed alternatives to oily fish or supplementation namely chicken meat and eggs naturally enriched with sustainable algae based omega pufa omega enriched chicken and eggs offer consumers an attractive alternative to eating oily fish or to the lifelong taking of supplements with the potential for substantial health benefits professor stanton said dr heather hayes director of food innovation with devenish said offering birds a natural and sustainable source of omega pufa is good for the bird and good for the consumer taste panel studies have shown that the omega enriched chicken meat tastes as good if not better than conventional chicken this science has demonstrated the importance of food nutrients to promote good health and prevent ill health we are also focusing our research efforts on producing sustainable and nutrient rich pork beef and milk with scientifically proven health claims omega is just one nutrient that we are interested in we are working on others too owen brennan executive chairman devenish added we worked closely with moy park waitrose and the royal college of surgeons in ireland to deliver an innovative nutrient rich food that increases omega levels in consumers naturally the science shows the importance of food nutrients to promote good health in consumers and the innovation starts on the farm the farmer has a key role to play in delivering sustainable and nutritious food with a health claim devenish is working hard to increase the opportunity for consumers to benefit from this nutrient rich food as less than of the world s population is eating enough omega dr patrick wall professor of public health at university college dublin said by enriching the birds diet the meat and eggs become naturally enriched with omega pufa and the associated nutritional benefits are then passed on to consumers morbidity is unevenly distributed in society and poorer people experience poorer health by including the omega in chicken and eggs both very affordable sources of quality protein all segments of the population can benefit from this approach to using innovative animal nutrition to benefit human health professor chris elliott founder of the institute for global food security pro vice chancellor faculty of medicine health life sciences queens university belfast said the cost to the health service of treating cardiovascular related illness in the uk is billion year having access to sustainably produced nutrient rich food with a scientifically proven

newswise women who need breast surgery to remove an abnormality that cannot be felt also known as a non palpable breast lesion now may benefit from the convenience and comfort provided by an advanced new tissue locating technology offered at rush university medical center the savi scout radar localization system helps to decrease the time a woman is in the operating room increase the success rates of lesion removal and reduce the amount of healthy breast tissue that is removed during the procedure rush began offering savi scout which has been used in more than lumpectomy surgeries in july savi scout allows a radiologist to insert a radar wave reflector the size of a grain of rice in the patient s breast up to days before surgery to mark the location of the lesion as shown with ultrasound or x ray mammography the reflector replaces the widespread current practice of inserting a thin hooked wire into the breast the same day as surgery when there is an abnormality that we can t feel and are unable to biopsy we have to find that lesion in surgery said dr andrea madrigrano assistant professor of surgery at rush university medical center savi scout replaces a more inconvenient technique used since s used since the s a hooked wire is placed in the breast through the skin to the abnormality using ultrasound or x ray guidance with local anesthesia the wire is placed into the breast to help guide the surgeon in removing the abnormality later that day until now a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast the woman would then be taken to the operating room area madrigrano said wire localization requires a high degree of coordination between radiology and surgical scheduling which can lead to delays between placement of the wire and surgery often requiring a woman to wait long periods of time with the wire in her breast before surgery these patients are in a hospital gown and are walking around while this wire is in place which obviously is less than ideal for the patient madrigrano said the radar reflector is a replacement for the wire and is essentially a little marker after the patient receives a local anesthetic it can be placed into the breast using an extremely thin needle under image guidance days or weeks prior to surgery because this important step is out of the way in advance it completely changes the patient s day of surgery experience radar can target abnormality within mm sparing more healthy tissue unlike mastectomy which treats breast cancer by removing an entire breast lumpectomy surgery also known as breast conserving surgery is used to remove only the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding the tumor using the savi scout system technology which emits million radar pulses per second surgeons can target the affected tissue within millimeter of the reflector when madrigrano told me about it i thought it was an ingenious idea and i m glad it was developed said nancy morrissey who underwent lumpectomy surgery at rush in july using the savi scout technology it made surgery go smoothly and i didn t have any pain before or after when the marker was inserted near the lump it was similar to a biopsy i was glad it was done a week before and not the same day as the lumpectomy surgery i have been very impressed with the experience according to cianna medical the company that created savi scout percent of women return to work the next day after the scout procedure in addition to enhancing the patient s surgical experience the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better that advantage may lead to less tissue needing to be removed and a better appearance of the breast after surgery ultimately this wireless technology has the potential to reduce surgical delays and more importantly will benefit patients by increasing comfort and satisfaction during a stressful time madrigrano said,1
genetic test could help fight secondary breast cancer new genetic test could benefit thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours bone strengthening drugs can help prevent the disease from spreading to the bone thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours could benefit from a potential new genetic test a study led by researchers at the university of sheffield has shown women with breast cancer who lack a key genetic marker are more likely to respond to a treatment that can prevent the disease spreading to their bones secondary cancer known as metastasis is the most common cause of death in breast cancer patients as there are few effective treatments once it has taken root it occurs when cancer cells spread to another site in the body around per cent of secondary breast cancer patients have tumours in the bone large scale clinical trials indicate a group of bone strengthening drugs known as bisphosphonates can help prevent the disease from spreading to bone in breast cancer patients if given early enough the difficulty is identifying which patients will benefit from these drugs said professor robert coleman emeritus professor of medical oncology who led the new study it only seems to be effective in some patients particularly older women while others show no response and in some younger women it may even be harmful the new study which is published in the journal lancet oncology has shown it may be possible to identify women who will benefit from bisphosphonates by using a test that looks for a gene known as maf women who do not carry the gene approximately per cent of women with breast cancer were found to benefit from the bone strengthening treatment professor coleman said if the test is negative for this gene then they can be offered this bone strengthening treatment which can give them a better chance of surviving their cancer a test for the gene known as maftest has been developed by a spanish medical company called inbiomotion following work conducted at the institute for research in biomedicine irb in barcelona the new study which is published in the journal lancet oncology was part of an international phase clinical trial involving women with stage ii or iii breast cancer the results need to be confirmed in a second trial currently underway in the united states before the test is likely to receive approval for wider use in patients but if successful it could be incorporated into the routine testing of breast cancer patients to see if they could benefit from bisphosphonate treatments such as zoledronic acid those found not to carry the gene could be given the drug after having surgery and radiotherapy for their primary tumour in an effort to prevent the cancer from spreading around women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the uk each year and the disease claims the lives of annually the discovery made at irb barcelona and tested in the current study could be of great use to clinicians and would avoid unnecessary treatment of patients who would not benefit or could be harmed by the treatment added professor roger gomis leader of the growth control and cancer metastasis group at irb barcelona who was a co author on the study additional information read the paper in lancet oncology coleman re hall a albanell j hanby a bell r cameron d dodwell d marshall h jean mairet j tercero jc rojo f gregory w and gomis rr effect of maf amplification on treatment outcomes with adjuvant zoledronic acid in early breast cancer a secondary analysis of the international open label randomised controlled phase azure big lancet oncology doi s the university of sheffield with almost of the brightest students from over countries learning alongside over of the best academics from across the globe the university of sheffield is one of the world s leading universities a member of the uk s prestigious russell group of leading research led institutions sheffield offers world class teaching and research excellence across a wide range of disciplines sheffield is the only university to feature in the sunday times best not for profit organisations to work for and was voted number one university in the uk for student satisfaction by times higher education in in the last decade it has won four queen s anniversary prizes in recognition of the outstanding contribution to the united kingdom s intellectual economic cultural and social life sheffield has six nobel prize winners among former staff and students and its alumni go on to hold positions of great responsibility and influence all over the world making significant contributions in their chosen fields global research partners and clients include boeing rolls royce unilever astrazeneca glaxo smithkline siemens and airbus as well as many uk and overseas government agencies and charitable foundations,1

characterized by the world health organization as a neglected tropical disease leprosy also known as hansen s disease is one of the most ancient diseases known to humankind and is caused by the bacteria mycobacterium leprae nearly a quarter of a million people worldwide have leprosy which causes disfiguration of the skin and mucous membranes as well as progressive and incurable nerve damage while drug therapy exists for leprosy it must be taken for many months has many side effects and often is given too late to reverse the permanent damage caused by the bacterial infection a viable vaccine to prevent and or treat leprosy is the next step in the effort to bring this disease to an end scientists at idri along with national and international collaborators including the national hansen s disease program and the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid part of the national institutes of health with financial support from american leprosy missions have developed a promising leprosy vaccine candidate designed to help treat leprosy and prevent exposed individuals from developing disease and the resulting disabilities based on data generated in preclinical studies the vaccine candidate called lepvax has progressed to phase i clinical testing in the united states the first stage of safety testing in human volunteers the clinical trial is focused on safety as well as evaluating the immune response to the vaccine while previous attempts have used vaccines primarily developed for other diseases this is the first totally defined vaccine candidate developed specifically for leprosy using the latest technologies and offering no less than those exposed to leprosy deserve said steven reed ph d idri president ceo founder the leprosy vaccine program at idri has benefited greatly from what we ve learned in the development of tuberculosis vaccine candidates over the past two decades although the bacteria that cause tuberculosis and leprosy are related leprosy vaccine development posed great challenges this vaccine represents a unique accomplishment requiring the most advanced technologies in molecular biology and immunology and american leprosy missions has been there from the beginning idri scientists have also developed two vaccine candidates for tuberculosis both in clinical stages of development we are thrilled that after years and an investment of over million made possible by our faithful donors and partners a leprosy specific vaccine is beginning a phase i clinical trial says bill simmons president and ceo of american leprosy missions we believe this may be the most exciting breakthrough in leprosy treatment since multi drug therapy the current treatment for leprosy was launched in the s we look forward to this vaccine improving the health outcomes of people diagnosed with leprosy and it may be that this vaccine can lead to interruption of the transmission of leprosy all together what a tremendous legacy this would leave for millions of people worldwide the vaccine was developed through significant efforts in screening and identifying m leprae proteins that trigger an effective immune response idri scientists then produced a fusion of four leprosy proteins which is combined with idri s proprietary immune stimulating adjuvant gla se with recent developments in vaccine technology idri scientists can now induce protective responses even after infection meaning it could be possible to prevent disease development in people already infected with the leprosy bacterium this generation of a vaccine to prevent and possibly treat leprosy is the result of years of research the development has been complicated by the fact that the organism that causes leprosy cannot be grown in culture in the laboratory reed explained this is a unique example of a vaccine produced by totally synthetic methods reed added that without the foresight and support of american leprosy missions there would be no leprosy vaccine candidate the vision and support of american leprosy missions has been tremendous as we ve worked with them throughout the years moving from our work in developing a leprosy diagnostic to our current focus on a successful leprosy vaccine he said the progress we ve had to date would not have been possible without american leprosy missions financial support and guidance early results from the phase i study should be available in and the partners are currently exploring mechanisms to advance the vaccine through later phase clinical trials should results from the phase i study clinical trial nct support further evaluation the vaccine candidate will serve as part of an overall strategy to end leprosy which will require detection prevention and treatment idri had developed technology to enable a rapid affordable point of care diagnostic test which was funded by niaid grant numbers r ai a and r ai in addition to idri and american leprosy missions a variety of partners are taking part in efforts to eliminate leprosy including novartis and the novartis foundation reed along with scientists from a variety of scientific organizations recently published innovative tools and approaches to end the transmission of mycobacterium leprae in the lancet infectious diseases outlining what is needed to achieve this goal together with scientific government and ngo partners the novartis foundation develops and implements strategies to help interrupt leprosy transmission while novartis donates the treatment for leprosy free of charge about idri as a nonprofit

multivitamins in pregnancy may be linked to lower autism risk in children evidence not yet sufficient to change practice but findings warrant further investigation say researchers taking multivitamins during early pregnancy may be associated with a reduced risk of autism spectrum disorder asd in children compared with mothers who do not take multivitamins finds a study published in the bmj today the researchers stress that their findings cannot establish cause and effect but say they raise questions about a possible association that warrant further investigation autism spectrum disorder asd includes a range of conditions including asperger syndrome that affect a person s social interaction communication interests and behaviour it s estimated that about in every people in the uk has asd more boys are diagnosed with the condition than girls research indicates that asd most likely develops in the womb and that a mother s diet during pregnancy could have an influence but results from previous studies have been inconsistent suggesting that other unmeasured factors confounding such as a mother s overall health and lifestyle could also play a role so an international research team set out to assess whether nutrient supplementation during pregnancy is associated with reduced risk of asd with and without intellectual disability they applied three analytical methods to a sample of mother child pairs living in stockholm sweden the sample was restricted to children who were to years of age by december and were born between and women reported their use of folic acid iron and multivitamin supplements at their first antenatal visit and cases of child asd were identified from national registers after adjusting for several potentially influencing factors in both mothers and children the researchers found that multivitamin use with or without additional iron and or folic acid was associated with a lower likelihood of child asd with intellectual disability relative to mothers who did not use folic acid iron and multivitamins there was no consistent evidence that either iron or folic acid use were associated with a reduced risk of asd the results of the various analyses seemed to be consistent with each other say the authors suggesting that the association between multivitamins and asd might not be fully explained by confounding they point to several study limitations such as the potential for confounding and difficulty assessing type timing and dose of supplements however strengths included the relatively large population based sample size and the advanced analytical methods used to gauge the robustness of findings together the three analyses appear to point toward a potential inverse association between multivitamin use with asd with intellectual disability say the authors given the current understanding and strength of evidence supporting the importance of nutritional supplementation during pregnancy it is impossible to imagine that these results on their own should change current practice they write however they say these findings raise questions that warrant investigation and call for verification in randomised studies before recommending a change to current practice ends notes to editors research antenatal nutritional supplementation and autism spectrum disorders in the stockholm youth cohort population based cohort study journal the bmj,1

boston sept adding minutes of moderate exercise per week is associated with improvements in overall physical functioning and decreases in risks of immobility in older adults who are sedentary finds a new study led by researchers at the jean mayer usda human nutrition research center on aging usda hnrca at tufts university in the study published in plos one on aug the researchers evaluated how different doses of exercise for adults age would impact the benefits while the researchers saw improvements in all participants who added some physical activity to their routine those who got more exercise saw greater changes the work is part of the lifestyle interventions and independence for elders life study these are people who want to live healthy independent lives and are at risk for losing that maintaining functional independence for older adults is an important public health issue in our first life study we confirmed that regular exercise can help improve physical function and prevent mobility loss now we see that small increases can have big impacts said first and corresponding author roger a fielding senior scientist and director of the nutrition exercise physiology and sarcopenia laboratory at the usda hnrca for the life study the researchers analyzed data from men and women age over an average of years half were randomly assigned to a program of walking and walking based strength flexibility and balance training half participated in health education workshops all had low levels of physical functioning at the start and reported fewer than minutes per week of regular physical activity in the month prior to starting the study participants were evaluated at baseline six and months the researchers relied on movement monitors and self reporting to measure physical activity outside study sessions changes in activity were significantly greater in the physical activity intervention group than the health education group from baseline through months there was a continuous graded effect with the greatest benefits seen in the participants who engaged in at least minutes of physical activity per week the greater differences were also associated with prevention of major mobility loss our goal was to have participants walking up to minutes per week to see benefits at minutes is encouraging we wanted the physical activity sessions to include exercise that participants could do outside of the study and we hope that learning of these results might motivate others to try to make safe incremental changes to their activity levels reducing muscle loss functional decline and loss of independence are important to anyone at any age and at any physical ability said fielding the researchers acknowledge limitations of this study including examining the different quantities of exercise participation achieved in the life study participants and not specifically prescribing different amounts of exercise to different study groups in addition there were differences in the measured absolute amounts of exercise performed when comparing objective activity monitoring using a wearable device and self report of physical activity

historic discovery promises to prevent miscarriages and birth defects globally update click here to read the latest statement from the victor chang institute overview one of australia s greatest discoveries in pregnancy research vitamin b can potentially treat molecular deficiencies which cause miscarriages and birth defects discovery promises to reduce miscarriages and birth defects findings expected to change the way pregnant women are cared for a blockbuster world first breakthrough at sydney s victor chang cardiac research institute is expected to prevent recurrent miscarriages and multiple types of birth defects in one of australia s most significant discoveries in pregnancy research crucially australian scientists have also demonstrated a potential cure in the form of a common dietary supplement this historic discovery is expected to forever change the way pregnant women are cared for around the globe every year million babies are born with a birth defect worldwide and one in four pregnant women suffer a miscarriage in australia in the vast majority of cases the cause of these problems has remained a mystery until now this breakthrough led by professor sally dunwoodie from the victor chang institute has identified a cause of recurrent miscarriages as well as heart spinal kidney and cleft palate problems in newborn babies the ramifications are likely to be huge this has the potential to significantly reduce the number of miscarriages and birth defects around the world and i do not use those words lightly says professor dunwoodie the landmark study found that a deficiency in a vital molecule known as nad can prevent a baby s organs from developing correctly in the womb nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide nad is one of the most important molecules in all living cells nad synthesis is essential for energy production dna repair and cell communication environmental and genetic factors can disrupt its production which can cause a nad deficiency world first research at the victor chang institute has found that this deficiency can be particularly harmful during a pregnancy as it can cripple an embryo when it is forming now after years of research our team has also discovered that this deficiency can potentially be cured and miscarriages and birth defects prevented by taking a common vitamin professor dunwoodie revealed at the heart of the paramount discovery is the dietary supplement vitamin b also known as niacin scientists at the victor chang institute have discovered simply boosting levels of this nutrient during pregnancy can potentially prevent recurrent miscarriages and birth defects vitamin b is required to make nad and is typically found in meats and green vegetables as well as vegemite however a recent study i found that despite taking vitamin supplements at least a third of pregnant women have low levels of vitamin b in their first trimester which is the critical time in organ development by the third trimester vitamin b levels were low in of pregnant women this indicates pregnant women may require more vitamin b than is currently available in most vitamin supplements using a preclinical mouse model scientists at the victor chang institute investigated the effect of vitamin b on developing embryos the results were astounding before vitamin b was introduced into the mother s diet embryos were either lost through miscarriage or the offspring were born with a range of severe birth defects after the dietary change both the miscarriages and birth defects were completely prevented with all the offspring born perfectly healthy this discovery is akin to the revolutionary breakthrough made last century that confirmed folic acid supplementation can prevent spina bifida and other neural tube defects in babies as a result consumption of folic acid has been adopted by expectant mothers worldwide and the addition of folate to our food supply has led to a decrease in the number of babies born with neural tube defects according to the executive director of the victor chang cardiac research institute professor robert graham the implications are profound just like we now use folate to prevent spina bifida professor dunwoodie s research suggests that it is probably best for women to start taking vitamin b very early on even before they become pregnant this could change the way pregnant women are cared for around the world said professor graham we believe that this breakthrough will be one of our country s greatest medical discoveries it s extremely rare to discover the problem and provide a preventive solution at the same time it s actually a double breakthrough said professor graham the next step will be to develop a diagnostic test to measure nad levels this will enable doctors to identify those women who are at greatest risk of having a baby with a birth defect and ensure they are getting sufficient vitamin b the findings have been released today by the new england journal of medicine the most prestigious clinical research publication in the world this study would not have been possible without the generous support of the chain reaction foundation the key foundation and the national health and medical research council statistics in pregnant women will suffer a miscarriage million babies are born with a serious birth defect worldwide every year million children under

newswise the first laser treatments used to treat skin conditions such as benign vascular birthmarks and port wine stains were developed more than years ago since then clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser based treatments including tattoo removal however it is difficult for the laser light which is held at a distance from the skin to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo now researchers from the university of missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact the techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin laser techniques come with risks including eye damage open air transmission in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients and doctors eyes paul j d whiteside a doctoral candidate in the mu division of food systems and bioengineering devised a system that will not only improve the process but will be safer for both clinicians and patients the system we developed uses ultrasonic pulsation in conjunction with a clinical laser to alter the properties of skin tissues during the procedure whiteside said we ve named the technique sonoillumination and we re hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future whiteside and his team including adviser heather k hunt an assistant professor of bioengineering in the mu college of engineering tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples using various amplitudes and pulses the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on april at the annual conference of american society for laser medicine and surgery aslms pork skin samples are very close to human skin samples so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications hunt said sonoillumination will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the aslms presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it s commercialized nicholas golda associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the mu school of medicine echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology our goal is to provide patients with safer more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed golda said this new technology may also provide physicians with a safer more controllable option for treating patients the team co authored the paper ultrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity which recently was accepted for publication by the society s journal lasers in surgery and medicine the sonoillumination research was funded in part by a fast track grant from the university of missouri system the team is in the planning stages of developing a start up company to commercialize the technique products produced by whiteside and the team highlight the university s impact on the state s economic development efforts including commercialization of research conducted at mizzou workforce development and job growth quality of life improvements for residents and attracting corporations and businesses to the state over the last five years companies commercializing mu technologies have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and grants to advance their commercialization efforts in the office of technology management and industry relations reported that mizzou received million in revenue from more than technology licenses the mu bioengineering department is jointly affiliated with college of agriculture food and natural resources cafnr and the college of engineering editor s note for more information on the patent application for sonoillumination please see,0

newswise san francisco march patients in their s and s who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation can be treated safely and effectively with stereotactic body radiation therapy sbrt according to research presented today at the multidisciplinary thoracic cancers symposium the advanced form of radiation therapy rt was well tolerated among this relatively understudied elderly population indicating that sbrt is a viable option for patients who may otherwise be offered no curative treatment while the primary treatment for early stage lung cancer is surgical removal of the tumor some patients may not be able to tolerate surgery due to health status advanced age or other factors for these patients the best curative option is sbrt a specialized type of external beam rt that uses advanced imaging techniques to deliver extremely targeted radiation to a tumor this high degree of precision makes sbrt particularly effective at sparing surrounding healthy tissue which is important for tumor sites near essential organs such as the heart and lungs patients complete sbrt treatment in three to five days compared with several weeks for conventional rt while multiple studies and trials have established the effectiveness of sbrt for inoperable early stage lung cancer one of the common reasons for not giving radiation in older patients is concern about tolerating the treatment and potential side effects said richard j cassidy iii md lead author of the study and a resident in radiation oncology at emory university s winship cancer institute in atlanta the low rates of side effects from sbrt for this elderly population in our study indicate that these concerns should not prevent physicians from considering definitive treatment for their inoperable octogenarian and nonagenarian patients with early stage lung cancer findings are based on a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients who received definitive lung sbrt across four academic sites within emory between and all patients were age or older at the time of their diagnosis with a median age of years forty percent of the tumors were adenocarcinomas while percent were squamous cell carcinomas and percent did not have a biopsy fifty percent of patients who did not have a biopsy had a previous history of lung cancer researchers used logistic regression and proportional hazard testing to determine the association of patient tumor and treatment characteristics to compare rates of survival recurrence and progression and assess the influence of patient and disease characteristics recursive partitioning analysis rpa was conducted to determine which patients were most likely to benefit from therapy at two years following definitive sbrt for lung cancer among elderly patients survival rates were percent for cancer specific survival css and percent for overall survival os css rates were higher for patients who were not active smokers but lower for patients who were older or had a previous lung cancer diagnosis smoking hazard ratio hr p age hr p cancer hr p os rates were higher for patients with higher karnofsky performance status kps which measures a patient s functional ability to perform ordinary tasks such as work and self care hr p researchers determined that this metric should be considered when offering sbrt in this elderly population with certain performance status criterion i e kps associated with significantly improved outcomes two year estimates of local control and regional control were percent and percent respectively local failure was more common among patients with adenocarcinomas hr p and less common for patients with t tumors hr p higher kps scores were associated with lower rates of both local failure hr p and regional failure hr p in terms of toxicity just over one third of patients experienced radiation pneumonitis of any grade with only two patients experiencing grade pneumonitis pneumonitis was more frequent among patients who were not actively using ace inhibitors odds ratio or p and less frequent in smaller tumors or p our study along with other studies helps to show that sbrt can effectively and safely add years to the lives of elderly patients who have early stage lung cancer but cannot undergo an operation for it said dr cassidy elderly patients who are otherwise doing well should not

integration of palliative care improves many measures of quality newswise new york march embargoed until march pm et cancer patients admitted to the hospital with advanced stages of disease who were referred early to palliative care had decreased health care utilization and increased use of support services following discharge according to a new study led by researchers at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai published today in the journal of oncology practice the study also determined that a systemized process of referrals resulted in significant improvements in day readmission rates hospice referral and receipt of chemotherapy after discharge in patients with advanced cancers this is the first study to demonstrate that among advanced cancer patients admitted to an inpatient oncology service standardized use of triggers for palliative care consultation is associated with substantial improvement on multiple quality measures patients with advanced cancers often have significant symptoms that affect their emotional status quality of life and functional ability the integration of palliative care improves symptom control and decreases unwanted health care use yet many patients are never offered these services as cancer progresses patients are often at high risk for physical pain and emotional distress said cardinale b smith md mscr associate professor of medicine hematology and medical oncology and of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai health care utilization is extremely high once cancer progresses with hospital readmission rates as high as percent and death in the acute care setting ranging from percent both measures of poor quality cancer care to improve the quality of care researchers at the icahn school of medicine developed standardized criteria or triggers for palliative care consultation for patients admitted to the cancer unit at the mount sinai hospital patients were eligible for this prospective cohort study if they met one or more eligibility criteria advanced solid tumor cancer prior hospitalization within days hospitalization for more than days or active symptoms care for patients with advanced cancer is often characterized by time spent on acute care hospital wards and intensive care units or receiving invasive procedures chemotherapy infusions and radiographic

madison wis march prnewswire a study from exact sciences corp nasdaq exas and mayo clinic released today by the american association of cancer research aacr shows promise for the development of a blood based lung cancer test researchers conducted a multi round study of nearly patients which demonstrated high accuracy for detecting lung cancer at all stages these results reveal an opportunity to detect lung cancer from a simple blood draw said kevin conroy chairman and ceo of exact sciences our collaboration with mayo clinic is efficiently identifying biomarkers for additional cancer applications on the same technology platform as cologuard aacr released an abstract of the study today ahead of the presentation of the results on april during the aacr annual meeting the findings from the study of patients controls and cancers demonstrate that biomarkers in plasma achieved high accuracy for all types and stages of lung cancer using two independent regression modeling approaches a panel of four novel methylated dna markers demonstrated a sensitivity of percent at a specificity of percent more studies are needed to corroborate accuracy however this plasma dna test approach appears to be a promising new method and may serve as a rational follow up to the common findings of lung nodules on ct scanning and may have application in screening for lung cancer said david e midthun m d a pulmonologist at mayo clinic lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer mortality resulting in million deaths globally and more than deaths in the united states every year most symptoms present in the late stages of the disease when the survival rate is only four percent early detection of lung cancer offers the opportunity to reduce mortality lung cancer screening is approved for smokers using chest ct scanning this approach has a sensitivity for lung cancer above percent but its specificity may fall below percent a false positive rate of more than percent because indeterminate lung nodules are so common evaluation of these false positives leads to unnecessary costly and potentially harmful procedures a blood based test may help guide next steps after a scan reveals an indeterminate nodule mr conroy said for example a positive blood test might suggest the need for a biopsy or surgery in contrast a negative test might suggest a less aggressive approach such a test could offer the opportunity to significantly improve health outcomes and reduce the financial impact on the health care system the abstract is available here a poster presentation of the

newswise arlington va march results from a new prospective clinical trial indicate that high dose rate hdr brachytherapy administered in a single gray gy treatment may be a safe and effective alternative to longer courses of hdr treatment for men with localized prostate cancer the study is available online in the international journal of radiation oncology biology physics the flagship journal of the american society for radiation oncology astro with brachytherapy also known as internal radiation therapy rt implants are surgically inserted in or near cancerous tissue to deliver a curative radiation dose directly to the tumor while limiting exposure for surrounding healthy tissue reducing this exposure is of particular concern for treating tumors in the prostate which is surrounded by multiple critical structures in contrast to low dose rate ldr brachytherapy where radioactive seed implants are placed permanently in the body and gradually deposit low levels of radiation over a period of months hdr treatments deposit the dose in one treatment after which the radioactive implant is removed from the patient typically hdr brachytherapy is administered in four to as many as nine treatment sessions which generally requires multiple invasive procedures to insert the implants while the number of sessions can be streamlined by increasing the dose given in each session data on the safety and tolerability of highly escalated brachytherapy doses are still relatively new and therefore limited in this study researchers found that patients who received a single fraction of gy hdr brachytherapy experienced similar clinical outcomes as with ldr brachytherapy but with the convenience of a single visit it is becoming apparent that patients may be treated definitively for their prostate cancer in as little as a single day with a minimally invasive outpatient procedure said lead study author daniel j krauss md a radiation oncologist at oakland university s william beaumont school of medicine in royal oak michigan we found that patients generally can resume normal activities the following day with typical side effects the study which appeared in the red journal s january issue presented the results of a nonrandomized prospective clinical trial of patients with low or intermediate risk non metastatic prostate cancer with a median follow up period of years all patients received a single gy fraction of hdr brachytherapy the median patient age was years range and percent of the patients presented with stage t disease at an average of nearly three years following treatment cancer control rates were favorable and the toxicity profile was highly favorable three patients experienced recurrence or progression yielding an estimated three year cumulative biochemical control rate of percent within the six months following hdr therapy seven patients experienced grade urinary side effects most commonly frequency urgency no patients experienced short term grade urinary toxicity or grade gastrointestinal gi toxicity rates were similarly modest for long term side effects six patients experienced chronic grade urinary toxicity and one patient experienced grade chronic gi toxicity that subsequently resolved no patients experienced long term grade urinary toxicity or grade gi toxicity this study illustrates that a potentially curative dose of radiation may be delivered safely to the prostate entirely in a single administration said dr krauss giving the entire dose in a single treatment theoretically could have had a greater negative impact on the normal tissues in close proximity to the prostate meaning the bladder urethra and rectum but this was not found to be the case toxicity rates were extremely low with essentially no major complications encountered in this initial group of patients while findings highlight the potential tolerability of a single fraction of hdr brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer the article also emphasizes the need for additional follow up to compare long term cancer control rates with conventional treatment approaches which generally administer larger cumulative doses than the gy dose used in this trial as the follow up interval lengthens gy dosing in a single fraction may or may not be sufficient to result in cure rates comparable to historical standards one thing that this study has made clear however is that the extremely low toxicity and complication rates leave room to escalate the single fraction dose in subsequent trials said dr krauss while additional study and longer follow up are necessary to confirm the optimal dose for single fraction hdr brachytherapy we are optimistic that the single treatment approach can eventually become a

newswise hospitals can improve patient care and reduce costs associated with coronary angioplasty if cardiologists perform more of these procedures through an artery in the wrist and if they take steps to discharge such patients on the same day according to a new study led by washington university school of medicine in st louis coronary angioplasty is a procedure in which arteries are opened to increase blood flow to the heart the research published feb in jacc cardiovascular interventions suggests that the lower costs of the wrist approach largely are due to the fact that patients experience fewer complications and can be discharged earlier compared with procedures that access the heart through the larger deeper artery in the groin the researchers estimated that shifting standard practice by percent to the wrist approach along with same day discharge could save the united states million per year we have unequivocal evidence and data that show better outcomes when we access the heart s coronary arteries and perform angioplasty through a blood vessel in the wrist rather than through the femoral artery in the groin said first author amit p amin md an assistant professor of medicine the femoral artery is the traditional route but when we go in through a vessel in the wrist we see less bleeding fewer complications less pain and discomfort higher patient satisfaction shorter hospital stays and lower costs patients may undergo coronary angioplasty also called percutaneous coronary intervention pci to alleviate chest pain or shortness of breath such symptoms suggest the coronary arteries that deliver blood to the heart are blocked or narrowed and oxygen delivery to the heart muscle is reduced interventional cardiologists insert a small tube into an artery in the wrist or the groin which can be used to view the narrowed heart artery deliver an inflatable balloon to open up the narrowed section and possibly deliver a stent to hold the vessel open using the national cardiovascular data registry cathpci registry the researchers analyzed data from almost medicare patients who underwent pci and were eligible for same day discharge despite the fact that all of these patients were capable of leaving the hospital the same day as their procedures only about percent of these patients actually were discharged without having stayed overnight we have seen that it is very safe to send these patients home the same day said amin who treats patients at barnes jewish hospital we use risk prediction models to predict their risks ahead of time and we plan ahead to mitigate any issues so we can facilitate a same day discharge this is really about patient care we want to outline health care pathways that provide the best care for patients the analysis demonstrated an average cost of for the wrist approach with same day discharge compared with for the groin approach with at least one night of hospitalization resulting in a cost savings of about for outpatients who get the wrist access procedure independent of the length of stay the wrist approach costs about less than the groin approach on average the investigators estimated that if a hospital performing of these procedures annually shifted percent of these patients to the wrist access with same day discharge approach the hospital would save million over that period expanding that practice to hospitals nationwide might save the united states million in health care spending per year health care costs for the patients who receive pci each year in the u s are estimated to be billion of the study s patient population receiving pci percent received the procedure in which doctors used wrist access according to amin improved technology has allowed wrist access to become a viable route to the coronary arteries even for complex cases and should be considered for more patients the traditional way has been to go through the bigger femoral artery that is a straight pathway to the heart amin said unfortunately that artery is also deep it s associated with more bleeding complications in contrast the wrist artery is small and is associated with fewer complications the minor challenge is in the difficulty of navigating a smaller more twisting path of an artery through the wrist but with advances we have in technology and equipment those challenges are rapidly

stem cell transplants may induce long term remission of multiple sclerosis encouraging results help set stage for larger studies new clinical trial results provide evidence that high dose immunosuppressive therapy followed by transplantation of a person s own blood forming stem cells can induce sustained remission of relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis ms an autoimmune disease in which the immune system attacks the central nervous system these five year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long term sustained remissions of poor prognosis relapsing remitting ms five years after receiving the treatment called high dose immunosuppressive therapy and autologous hematopoietic cell transplant hdit hct percent of trial participants had survived without experiencing progression of disability relapse of ms symptoms or new brain lesions notably participants did not take any ms medications after receiving hdit hct other studies have indicated that currently available ms drugs have lower success rates the trial called halt ms was sponsored by the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid part of the national institutes of health and conducted by the niaid funded immune tolerance network itn the researchers published three year results from the study in december and the final five year results appear online feb in neurology the medical journal of the american academy of neurology these extended findings suggest that one time treatment with hdit hct may be substantially more effective than long term treatment with the best available medications for people with a certain type of ms said niaid director anthony s fauci m d these encouraging results support the development of a large randomized trial to directly compare hdit hct to standard of care for this often debilitating disease ms symptoms vary widely and may include motor and speech difficulties weakness fatigue and chronic pain the most common form of ms is relapsing remitting ms which is characterized by periods of mild or no symptoms interspersed with symptom flare ups or relapses over years the disease can worsen and shift to a progressive form in halt ms researchers tested the safety efficacy and durability of hdit hct in volunteers aged to years with relapsing remitting ms who despite taking clinically available medications experienced active inflammation evidenced by frequent severe relapses and worsened neurological disability the experimental treatment aims to suppress active disease and prevent further disability by removing disease causing cells and resetting the immune system during the procedure doctors collect a participant s blood forming stem cells give the participant high dose chemotherapy to deplete the immune system and return the participant s own stem cells to rebuild the immune system the treatment carries some risks and many participants experienced the expected side effects of hdit hct such as infections three participants died during the study none of the deaths were related to the study treatment five years after hdit hct most trial participants remained in remission and their ms had stabilized in addition some participants showed improvements such as recovery of mobility or other physical capabilities although further evaluation of the benefits and risks of hdit hct is needed these five year results suggest the promise of this treatment for inducing long term sustained remissions of poor prognosis relapsing remitting ms said richard nash m d of colorado blood cancer institute and presbyterian st luke s hospital dr nash served as principal investigator of the halt ms study if these findings are confirmed in larger studies hdit hct may become a potential therapeutic option for patients with active relapsing remitting ms particularly those who do not respond to existing therapies said daniel rotrosen m d director of niaid s division of allergy

december by samantha bonar newswise city of hope patient susan young has had a remarkable response to a potentially revolutionary new treatment a combination of the p cancer vaccine and a drug that blocks a specific cancer aiding protein the year old came to city of hope in august from uc davis with advanced triple negative breast cancer that had metastasized to her bones and skin she had exhausted all of her chemotherapy options and this experimental treatment was her last hope the only other option was hospice at least to percent of her body was covered by lesions inflammation and thickened purplish skin said yuan yuan m d breast cancer oncologist at city of hope who treated young six weeks into her treatment the skin lesions were gone her itchiness went away it s quite a dramatic response so dramatic in fact that yuan refers to young as her miracle patient this in some ways is pretty unprecedented this patient is at a late stage of her disease there are no treatments available that would have done the same thing said don j diamond ph d chair of the department of experimental therapeutics at city of hope young received a combination of the p vaccine and the drug pembrolizumab diamond developed the vaccine and has been studying its effectiveness in clinical trials at coh since he currently is testing it on ovarian cancer and other solid tumors such as pancreatic and gastrointestinal masses i ve responded great i m feeling good said young who has received six of seven pembrolizumab infusions each of which takes about a half hour and all three p vaccine injections my skin has cleared up i think the prognosis is going to be good now teaching the immune system to fight the most frequent mutation across all cancers occurs in a gene called p which contributes to cells becoming oncogenic when they produce a mutant form of the p protein p gene mutations are present in about of malignancies diamond s vaccine boosts the immune response to many different mutant forms of p the researchers tested this vaccine known as p mva in a clinical trial and found it to be safe in patients with advanced gastrointestinal cancers however patients whose t cells had pre existing high levels of a protein named pd a molecule that instructs immune cells to shut down responded poorly to the anti p vaccine in a subsequent laboratory study the coh researchers showed that these patients immune cells could be reactivated by treatment with a pd inhibitor that is a biosimilar to the clinical drug called pembrolizumab together the vaccine and the drug potentially could form a potent team to reactivate the immune system to quickly clear out cancer cells before young the combination had been tried on patients with recurrent solid tumors such as non small cell lung cancer melanoma renal cell carcinoma and many other cancer types so far while diamond has noted an immune response in patients given the combination treatment in clinical trials he has not seen a clinical benefit that is until he met young we have treated a number of different types of patients with the combination but nothing is even in the same universe as this he said a shocking response young who tested positive for the p mutation has been fighting breast cancer for eight years and has undergone one chemo after another yuan said referred to city of hope by her physician at davis she began responding to the experimental treatment right away yuan said her skin tumors disappearing and the latest biopsies showing no cancer the purple thickened skin has faded away the skin color has normalized she s healed basically she said it s such a promising early response it s quite unusual she added we have two drugs here so it s hard to dissect which drug did what but we do think the vaccine played a key role it was shocking to me said diamond what we have noticed is that her immune response to p has been increasing as time goes on it was of tremendous magnitude in the last blood draw the next step will be to take bone and ct scans to see if the cancer is disappearing internally as well as externally which young will receive in a couple of weeks even now though young is extremely happy with the results yuan said her psychological wellbeing has improved her appetite is better she s more functional she went through a lot it will be very interesting to follow up i couldn t look at myself it was really hard young said of the skin lesions she had endured for five years they started to go away after the third treatment she said even the marks where it was climbing up my neck are all gone further study needed what diamond is hoping for now is funding for a full clinical trial so that he can test the combination in advanced triple negative breast cancer patients who test positive for p a couple of major drug companies have already expressed interest in his vaccine he said what we would like is to have women come here from all over the country and the world to receive this vaccine formula so that we can test this combination diamond said if it happened once maybe it will happen twice but we ve got to get these patients in following the success in young the formula has recently been given to two other triple negative breast cancer patients at city of hope it s too early to gauge the response although the entire breast team is very excited about this diamond said we saw this phenomenal response in this patient i am very encouraged by the findings so i think there s a story to come everything is turning around for me young said i was very frightened when i started out i m not that frightened anymore i know it still can turn for me but i think i m going to be the miracle that dr yuan wants,0

jacksonville fla researchers at mayo clinic s campus in florida have conducted the world s first prospective blinded and placebo controlled clinical study to test the benefit of using bone marrow stem cells a regenerative medicine therapy to reduce arthritic pain and disability in knees the researchers say such testing is needed because there are at least stem cell clinics in the u s offering one form of stem cell therapy or another to an estimated plus patients who pay thousands of dollars out of pocket for the treatment which has not undergone demanding clinical study the findings in the american journal of sports medicine include an anomalous finding patients not only had a dramatic improvement in the knee that received stem cells but also in their other knee which also had painful arthritis but received only a saline control injection each of the patients enrolled in the study had two bad knees but did not know which knee received the stem cells given that the stem cell treated knee was no better than the control treated knee both were significantly better than before the study began the researchers say the stem cells effectiveness remains somewhat uninterpretable they are only able to conclude the procedure is safe to undergo as an option for knee pain but they cannot yet recommend it for routine arthritis care our findings can be interpreted in ways that we now need to test one of which is that bone marrow stem cell injection in one ailing knee can relieve pain in both affected knees in a systemic or whole body fashion says the study s lead author shane shapiro m d a mayo clinic orthopedic physician journalists sound bites with dr shane shapiro are available in the downloads below media contact kevin punsky mayo clinic public affairs one hypothesis is that the stem cells we tested can home to areas of injury where they are needed which makes sense given that stem cells injected intravenously in cancer treatments end up in the patients bone marrow where they need to go he says this is just a theory that can explain our results so it needs further testing another explanation is that merely injecting any substance into a knee offered relief from pain that could be but both this idea and the notion that a placebo effect could be involved would be surprising given that some patients are still doing very well years after their study treatment ended says dr shapiro he adds that these findings are important because while use of a patient s own stem cells for regenerative therapy is extraordinarily popular the treatments may be untested and are often poorly regulated stem cell clinics often offer expensive treatments for conditions that range from multiple sclerosis lung and heart disease to cosmetic treatments such as facelifts none of these techniques have been studied because clinics maintain that use of a patient s own cells is not a drug but depending on how they are processed and used stem cells can in fact be regulated by the u s food and drug administration as biological products or drugs requiring rigorous safety and efficacy approval processes in early september the fda held scientific meetings to clarify how to regulate such practices mayo clinic researchers developed their study with fda approval we feel that if we are going to offer any stem cell procedures to our patients the science needs to be worked out dr shapiro says the study was conducted in mayo s human cell therapy lab researchers extracted to milliliters of bone marrow from each patient then filtered it removed all blood cells and concentrated it down to to milliliters the solution which contained tens of thousands of stem cells was injected into a patient s knee using ultrasound guided imagery we actually counted all of the stem cells with markers that are accepted by the fda and we made sure they would be able to survive inside the patient dr shapiro says counting is expensive most clinics just draw the cells from bone marrow or fat and inject them back into the patient without checking for stem cells hoping that patients get better he says dr shapiro and his colleagues are currently designing new studies that will test whether the stem cells home to distant areas of injuries as well as exploring other implications suggested in their findings study investigators include mayo clinic in florida senior author mary l o connor m d shari e kazmerchak michael g heckman and abba c zubair m d ph d dr o connor is now at yale university funding for this study was from mayo clinic s center for regenerative medicine about mayo clinic mayo clinic is a nonprofit organization committed to clinical practice education and research providing expert whole person care to everyone who needs healing for more information visit or,1

newswise when combined with psychological counseling a single dose of a mind altering compound contained in psychedelic mushrooms significantly lessens mental anguish in distressed cancer patients for months at a time according to results of a clinical trial led by researchers at nyu langone medical center published in the journal of psychopharmacology online dec the study showed that one time treatment with the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin whose use required federal waivers because it is a banned substance quickly brought relief from distress that then lasted for more than six months in percent of the study subjects monitored based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression the nyu langone led study was published side by side with a similar study from johns hopkins study results were also endorsed in accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry addiction and palliative care our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer related psychological distress says study lead investigator stephen ross md director of substance abuse services in the department of psychiatry at nyu langone if larger clinical trials prove successful then we could ultimately have available a safe effective and inexpensive medication dispensed under strict control to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients says ross also an associate professor of psychiatry at nyu school of medicine study co investigator jeffrey guss md a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at nyu langone notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile study participants he says experienced no serious negative effects such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions although the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin which is known to control mood and anxiety serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression for the study half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo milligrams of niacin known to produce a rush that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience approximately half way through the study s monitoring period after seven weeks all participants switched treatments those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo and those who first took niacin then received psilocybin neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo guss says the randomization placebo control and double blind procedures maximized the validity of the study results one of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the study s extended monitoring period specifically eight months for those who took psilocybin first all patients in the study mostly women age to who are or were patients at the perlmutter cancer center of nyu langone had either advanced breast gastrointestinal or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease all patients who volunteered to be part of the study were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist psychologist nurse or social worker and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state co investigator anthony bossis phd a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at nyu langone says patients also reported post psilocybin improvements in their quality of life going out more greater energy getting along better with family members and doing well at work several also reported variations of spirituality unusual peacefulness and increased feelings of altruism our study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress says bossis and if it s true for cancer care then it could apply to other stressful medical conditions bossis cautions that patients should not consume psilocybin on their own or without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor he also says psilocybin therapy may not work for everyone and some groups such as people with schizophrenia as well as adolescents should not be treated with it both the nyu langone and johns hopkins studies were principally funded by the heffter research institute a non profit scientific institution with the principal mission of helping to design review and fund studies on the use of psilocybin for a wide range of ailments ross previously served as a board member

newswise new orleans nov patients with obesity who swallowed gas filled balloon capsules designed to help them eat less lost times more weight than patients who relied on diet exercise and lifestyle therapy alone according to new research presented today at obesityweek the largest international event focused on the basic science clinical application and prevention and treatment of obesity the annual conference is hosted by the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery asmbs and the obesity society tos the significant weight loss achieved with the obalon month balloon system is maintained at months said aurora pryor md study co author and chief bariatric foregut and advanced gi surgery stony brook university this combination of lifestyle modification and balloon therapy provides a new low risk option for patients struggling with obesity the obalon month balloon system a swallowable gas filled intragastric balloon for weight loss in adults with obesity for whom diet and exercise has failed was approved in september by the u s food and drug administration fda it involves a balloon contained within a capsule that once it reaches the stomach is inflated with gas via a microcatheter up to three balloons may be placed over the first three months but the entire treatment period lasts six months the inflated balloons make patients feel full treatment is accompanied by a moderate intensity diet and behavior modification program the device is manufactured by obalon therapeutics inc based in san diego ca results of the study were based on a double blinded randomized sham controlled trial of patients about half of whom received treatment with the obalon balloon and the other half with a sugar filled sham capsule designed to look like the device patients who had a body mass index bmi of between and swallowed three capsules over a week period one every three weeks all patients at the study sites also underwent minutes of lifestyle therapy administered by a blinded registered dietitian every three weeks after six months patients were informed which capsule they received and those with the obalon balloons had them removed endoscopically average percent total weight loss after six months for obalon balloon patients was percent while those in the sham control group had percent total average weight loss balloon treated patients had nearly percent excess weight loss six months after the balloons were removed percent of the average total weight lost during the treatment period was maintained researchers say a single adverse event a bleeding gastric ulcer occurred in one balloon patient on high dose nsaids who had an outpatient knee replacement procedure non serious adverse device events mostly abdominal cramping and nausea occurred in percent of patients were rated mild or moderate there is no magic pill for obesity but this swallowable balloon and other intragastric balloons may offer new hope to people who otherwise would not seek treatment or not have as good a result with diet and exercise alone said raul j rosenthal md asmbs president and chairman department of general surgery cleveland clinic florida who was not involved in the study the balloon and other technologies may help to fill the therapeutic gaps between diet and exercise and medical therapy and medical therapy and surgery where the gaps are quite large people with obesity and severe obesity have higher rates of heart disease diabetes some cancers arthritis sleep apnea high blood pressure and dozens of other diseases and conditions studies have shown individuals with a bmi greater than have a to percent greater risk of premature death compared to healthy weight individuals metabolic bariatric surgery has been shown to be the most effective and long lasting treatment for severe obesity and many related conditions and results in significant weight loss the agency for healthcare research and quality ahrq reported significant improvements in the safety of metabolic bariatric surgery due in large part to improved laparoscopic techniques the risk of death is about percent and the overall likelihood of major complications is

the article reports that the device provides clear visualization of the surgical site where the tumor was removed thereby improving communication between the surgeon and radiation oncologist the study also noted that the device provides a helpful guide for post treatment mammograms and other long term follow up to check for any cancer recurrence in these patients a second study presented at the american society for radiation oncology astro annual conference describes the extra utility that biozorb can provide by significantly reducing the amount of normal breast and surrounding tissues that are exposed to radiation treatment the world journal of surgery article by lead author breast surgeon michael j cross concluded that the d marker is an effective method for delineating the tumor bed with a significant utility for rt radiation therapy planning in the course of this three year study dr cross and colleagues also documented a favorable shift toward use of hypo fractionated radiation treatment a shorter form of radiation associated with a substantial reduction in treatment costs through our experience with this marker we ve observed that its use results in less radiation dose to the patient compared to whole breast radiation plus a better overall cosmetic outcome said dr cross a nationally known breast surgeon at breast treatment associates in fayetteville ark we were also pleased to note in our research that there were no device related complications in this group of patients and that none of them had a recurrence of cancer the biozorb device is placed during lumpectomy surgery which removes the cancer and preserves the breast it is the first and only device that identifies in a reliable way the d region where the tumor was removed it is particularly effective because by suturing the implant to the tumor bed the surgeon can more precisely indicate to the radiation oncologist where the cancer was located dr cross notes that because of the marker s unique configuration it can also assist with reconstructing the surgical region during the healing process the implantable marker consists of a framework made of a bioabsorbable material that holds six titanium clips the framework slowly dissolves in the body over the course of a year or more the tiny marker clips stay in place so the surgical site can be viewed for long term monitoring such as mammograms as part of the research for the world journal of surgery study patients with early stage breast cancer were prospectively implanted with the marker during reconstructive lumpectomy a method of oncoplastic surgery to remove the cancer while reconstructing the remaining breast to improve cosmetic outcomes the average age of women in the study was years the authors concluded that the marker was helpful for several different types of physicians involved in the care of women with breast cancer surgeons radiation oncologists who plan and oversee radiation treatment and radiologists who follow women after breast cancer treatment the article also noted that there was a shift during the three year course of the study toward increasing use of hypo fractionated radiation methods these methods decrease the time it takes for patients to complete radiation treatment and are estimated to cut the cost of treatment by approximately the authors said use of the marker facilitated their shift toward these shorter courses of radiotherapy use of the marker allowed physicians to be more confident in their targeting and rely less on ambiguous planning targets such as the seroma and surrounding tissue changes seroma is a collection of fluid that builds up in the area of tissue injury after surgery while seromas have customarily been targeted for radiation treatment they do not always reflect where the cancer was and can overestimate the size of the target areas in need of radiation by more precisely marking the tumor bed the article said biozorb can reduce the amount of healthy tissue that would otherwise receive unnecessary radiation the second recent study presented at the annual astro conference in boston described a collaborative approach between a radiation oncologist and breast surgeon they studied the question of whether the marker could better identify the true lumpectomy cavity and thereby reduce the amount of tissue that is irradiated the authors radiation oncologist william hall m d and breast surgeon cary kaufman m d combined their analysis of cases in which biozorb was used they concluded that the tissue marker could significantly reduce radiation of healthy breast tissue an average of reduction as well as avoid irradiating inadvertent seromas that are more common with oncoplastic procedures by providing better targeting they said the marker could also play a role in facilitating the use of external beam partial breast irradiation the process of delivering radiation treatment is substantially streamlined by having the d marker in place said dr hall the marker tells us where the tumor was and helps us determine appropriate forms of treatment whether with partial breast irradiation or standard whole breast irradiation and a boost dose at the end of the treatment process dr hall is a radiation oncologist in the department of radiation oncology at peacehealth st joseph medical center bellingham wash dr kaufman is medical

newswise columbus oh good news for the millions of people who suffer from skin wounds that won t heal a team of researchers at the ohio state university has brought a potentially transformative solution to the problem by creating a portable adhesive patch that drives a continuous small electrical current to stimulate healing and reduce the risk of infection nearly million americans have chronic wounds typically a result of diabetes obesity or other conditions that impact circulation costing the healthcare system nearly billion each year the non healing wounds are painful can permanently damage nerves prevent mobility and in extreme cases cause infection that can lead to death the patch s design significantly advances existing fda approved wireless electroceutical dressing wed that harnesses the body s innate response to injury to help wounds heal a wound naturally produces its own electrical fields that help reduce bacteria and promote cell regeneration however this function is likely impaired in chronic wounds said sashwati roy phd an associate professor in the department of surgery at ohio state s college of medicine the prototype dressing mimics this physiological process and while it has proven to create an optimal environment where chronic wounds can heal we are always looking for new ways to keep pathogens under better control roy notes that chronic wounds are particularly susceptible to infection because bacteria which at times are free floating within a wound can sometimes mobilize creating colonies covered by a thick sticky coating called a biofilm the immune system cannot penetrate the biofilm and antibiotics can t get in either causing constant inflammation and low level infection that can further dampen the healing process now with support from ohio state s center for clinical and translational science ccts researchers from both the college of engineering and the college of medicine are taking the technology to the next level working with a mechanical and aerospace engineering team led by shaurya prakash phd and vish subramaniam phd the scientists have optimized the bandage s design and the amount of electrical current delivered like present weds the new prototype is flexible portable and self contained made of silk and silver the experimental dressing includes a self contained battery that delivers a continuous safe low level electrical current to the injury we re hoping this new design may allow electric fields and currents to penetrate more deeply into wounds and really get to where these biofilms may be hiding said subramaniam chair of the department of mechanical and aerospace engineering at ohio state the destruction of the biofilm would enable antibiotics to start killing off bacteria reduce chronic inflammation and allow the body s natural immune response to work more effectively bacteria are known to quickly acquire resistance against antibiotics but to our knowledge bacteria do not develop resistance against electroceuticals to test the experimental design roy and a team of scientists developed an animal model to mimic the skin function of a person suffering from metabolic syndrome obesity high blood pressure high blood sugar which mirrors the type of patient that typically develops chronic wounds animal models had skin injuries infected with pseudomonas aeruginosa staphylococcus aureus or acinetobacter baumannii three different types of bacteria that commonly infect wounds and develop biofilms that are treatment resistant early results which were presented at the wound healing society s annual meeting in april indicate that infected wounds covered by the experimental bioelectric dressing healed better and more quickly than those covered with a plain dressing that is commonly used in the care of wounds today scientists hypothesize that the electrical currents may disrupt bacteria in two ways by interrupting the production of chemical messages that instruct bacteria to develop biofilms and by weakening the molecular structure of existing biofilms potentially making them more susceptible to antibiotics or the body s natural immune response the team s next move is to focus on the bioelectric bandage as a treatment for chronic wounds in a patient population however the technology could also be used to treat acute injuries roy also notes that the u s department of defense is very interested in the dressing as a temporary measure to help prevent infection in soldiers wounded on the battle front this technology has a long shelf life and is compact enough to be put into any field medical kit it could be applied immediately to wounds help keep bacteria from mobilizing and start promoting healing until the soldier could be transported to a facility for more intensive medical care the team already has interest from several industry partners and is hoping to begin testing the new technology in patients before the end of the year to determine optimal treatment duration and more about the healing effects of electrical fields on skin cells on a molecular level roy s research team includes shomita s steiner phd

newtown pa sept prnewswire kvk tech inc announced today that the u s food and drug administration fda has approved lomaira phentermine hydrochloride usp mg tablets civ a low cost low dose prescription medicine used for a short period of time a few weeks for weight reduction in adults with an initial body mass index bmi of or more obese or or more overweight with at least one weight related condition such as controlled high blood pressure diabetes or high cholesterol lomaira should be used together with regular exercise and a reduced calorie diet lomaira is the only strength of phentermine hydrochloride that can be taken up to three times a day before meals the limited usefulness of agents of this drug class anorectics including lomaira should be measured against possible risk factors inherent in their use at kvk tech we are committed to developing high quality fda approved medicines that address unmet medical needs while ensuring affordable options for all appropriate patients with lomaira we re giving physicians and patients access to a low cost low dose version of a weight reduction medicine phentermine that has been prescribed by physicians for over years appropriate patients can take lomaira up to three times a day before meals not just in the morning as with the higher dose formulations of phentermine said anthony tabasso president and chief executive officer of kvk tech we developed lomaira with this dosing flexibility and affordability in mind phentermine hydrochloride an appetite suppressant is the most commonly prescribed drug for weight loss over million prescriptions are written for phentermine yearly by a wide range of healthcare professionals hcps including obesity medicine specialists family practitioners endocrinologists internists and cardiologists phentermine hydrochloride is typically prescribed in doses ranging from to mg and taken before or within a few hours of breakfast the usual adult dose of lomaira is one tablet three times a day hour before meals the butterfly shaped tablet is scored to facilitate administering one half of the usual dosage for patients not requiring the full dose enabling doctors and patients to work together to customize a weight loss treatment plan to best meet each patient s needs dosage should be individualized to obtain an adequate response with the lowest effective dose phentermine is not recommended for use in pediatric patients years of age or younger late evening medication should be avoided because of the possibility of resulting insomnia lomaira is reasonably priced to ensure that cost does not create a hurdle despite the fact that two thirds of americans pay out of pocket for their weight loss prescription medications through kvk tech s lomaira lo cost access program eligible patients will pay no more than per tablet for the duration of treatment obesity is a chronic metabolic disease that must be managed appropriately to reduce the risk of serious health conditions many physicians have used phentermine to help patients as part of a comprehensive weight management plan now the flexibility in dosing with lomaira allows doctors to personalize dosing they can prescribe a lower dose a good option for some patients they can also prescribe up to three times a day which is particularly helpful when patients struggle to control their appetite in the afternoon said donna ryan md regrettably many patients are still not covered by insurance for weight loss medications and the low cost for lomaira makes it an affordable treatment option in relatively short term clinical trials adults with obesity who were instructed in dietary management and treated with anorectic drugs appetite suppressants lost more weight on the average than those treated with placebo and diet it has not been established that the primary action of such drugs in treating obesity is one of appetite suppression since other central nervous system actions or metabolic effects may also be involved even modest weight loss can dramatically improve risk and health continued dr ryan it is not necessary to lose a lot of weight to get a lot of benefit losing five to percent of total body weight is likely to produce health benefits such as improvements in blood pressure blood cholesterol and blood sugars some side effects of phentermine that have been reported include pulmonary hypertension valvular heart disease palpitations increased heart rate or blood pressure insomnia restlessness dry mouth diarrhea constipation and changes in sexual drive

for centuries pathologists have relied on the microscopic examination of tumors to distinguish between atypical moles and melanoma by analyzing the level of proteins within mole cells mass spectrometry can aid in the diagnosis of atypical moles in this study mass spectrometry correlated better than the gold standard of histologic examination to determine if an atypical mole was in fact benign or a melanoma early diagnosis of melanoma is critical to cure and long term survival california skin institute a recently developed test for assessing suspicious moles for melanoma is more accurate than standard analyses according to dr rossitza lazova a former yale investigator the test which analyzes proteins in cells could provide more reliable results for clinicians with patients who might be at risk for this deadly cancer the study was published on august th in the journal of the american academy of dermatology melanoma is one of the most common forms of cancer and the most serious type of skin cancer the gold standard for diagnosing melanoma is skin biopsy followed by microscopic examination of sampled tissue however in up to in cases the results are inconclusive for the study a former associate professor of dermatology and pathology at yale university rossitza lazova m d collaborated with a national and international team of researchers to determine whether atypical moles could be more accurately diagnosed as either benign or cancerous melanoma using imaging mass spectrometry ims a technology that enables pathologists to focus in on individual proteins within sampled skin cells in a prior study the researchers used ims to identify a molecular signature comprised of five proteins to differentiate between one type of benign mole and melanoma the research team retrospectively analyzed more than cases of atypical moles they compared results from ims diagnosis to results based on standard microscopic examination of biopsies and correlated them with clinical outcomes the researchers found that in nearly all cases the ims analysis was a more accurate predictor both of benign lesions and melanomas than standard microscopic examination instead of pathologists being dependent solely upon the physical appearance of the cells they now have the additional advantage of molecular information regarding the protein makeup of cells provided by mass spec imaging said dr lazova who is corresponding author on the study this test integrates anatomic pathology and analytical chemistry in a very useful and meaningful way the finding suggests that ims analysis based on proteomic signatures may improve both diagnosis and prediction of outcomes for patients with ambiguous moles the researchers said other authors include erin h seeley heinz kutzner richard a scolyer glynis scott lorenzo cerroni isabella fried milena e kozovska arlene s rosenberg victor g prieto bahig m shehata megan m durham gina henry jose l rodriguez peralto erica riveiro falkenbach jochen t schaefer richard danialan sylvie fraitag sonja vollenweider roten alireza sepehr martin sangueza nouf hijazi yamile corredoira rachel kowal olga m harris francisco bravo alan s boyd ralitza gueorguieva and richard m caprioli the study was supported in part by a grant from the national institutes of health dr lazova is currently the director of dermatopathology at california skin institute in san jose california source california skin institute san jose california united states,1

included participants with moderate to severe essential tremor a condition that often robs people of their ability to write feed themselves and carry out their normal daily activities the trial participants all had tried existing medications without success the mean age was and most had suffered with their tremor for many years seventy five percent of participants received the experimental treatment using focused ultrasound guided by magnetic resonance imaging the remaining percent underwent a sham procedure to act as the control group they would later be given the opportunity to undergo the real procedure participants who received the treatment showed dramatic improvement with the beneficial effects continuing throughout the study period the researchers employed a point scale to assess tremor severity and they found that mean tremor scores improved by percent at three months and percent at months participants reported major improvements in their quality of life people who couldn t feed themselves soup or cereal could again do so participants who received the sham procedure on the other hand showed no significant improvements the degree of tremor control was very good overall in the study but the most important aspects were the significant gains in disabilities and quality of life that s what patients really care about elias said the most commonly reported side effects were gait disturbances and numbness in the hand or face in most instances these side effects were temporary but some were permanent fda approved based on the clinical trial led by elias the federal food and drug administration has approved the focused ultrasound device manufactured by insightec inc for the treatment of essential tremor the device focuses sound waves inside the brain to create heat much like a magnifying glass focuses light that heat can then be used to interrupt the troublesome brain connections responsible for the tremor elias can actually watch as patients tremor decreases and the real time imaging allows him to zone in on exactly the right spot before making any permanent changes to the brain the fda approval means uva can make the procedure available to eligible patients uva however is still working out the necessary logistics it s not yet clear when elias will begin treating patients because the approach is so new insurance plans will not yet cover the procedure though that may change in the coming months the cost at uva has not yet been determined people interested in the procedure can learn more at uvahealth com focusedultrasound the site includes a list of frequently asked questions and will be updated as uva prepares to make the treatment available the procedure is not for everyone with essential tremor it can t be used in patients who cannot undergo mri imaging including those with implanted metallic devices such as a pacemaker it is also not available for pregnant women people with heart conditions or very high blood pressure patients with kidney disease or clotting disorders patients on blood thinners patients with a history of strokes or brain tumors and people with substance abuse issues there are other exclusions as well doctors at uva will evaluate potential patients to determine their eligibility and then recommend the best course of treatment groundbreaking researchuva is a world leader in focused ultrasound research elias and his colleagues are testing the capability of focused ultrasound to treat parkinson s disease epilepsy brain tumors and benign breast tumors the essential tremor research has been supported by insightec the focused ultrasound foundation and the bird us israel binational industry research and development foundation for reporters elias will be available for interviews today and he ll be doing a facebook live broadcast at eastern to arrange an interview contact alex prevost at or high resolution images and video are available as well,1
philadelphia patients with aggressive subtypes of locally advanced breast cancer may have new treatment options on the horizon according to two reports published in july in the new england journal of medicine results of two different investigational arms of a multi drug phase ii trial conducted in part by researchers at the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania and the abramson cancer center show that use of new targeted therapies neratinib or a combination of veliparib and carboplatin improves outcomes when used in addition to standard chemotherapy before surgery for patients with her positive and triple negative breast cancer respectively the results are part of the multi institutional i spy study compared to standard therapies alone the drugs tested in the trial substantially reduced the presence of residual disease in the breast tissue and lymph nodes known as achieving pathological complete response or pcr when administered before surgery said angela demichele md msce a professor of hematology oncology and epidemiology at the perelman school of medicine at the university of pennsylvania a co investigator and chair of trial operations for the study known as i spy pcr strongly predicts prevention of later recurrence of incurable metastatic disease these results suggest that neratinib and veliparib carboplatin are very promising treatment options for patients with her positive and triple negative breast cancer respectively in addition the platform used for the i spy trial allows the research team to test these and other new therapies simultaneously targeting tumor subtypes that would be most likely to benefit from the therapies minimizing the exposure of patients to treatments that are not likely to work for their disease subtype and accelerating drug development the data presented in the two nejm articles shows that when added to standard neoadjuvant chemotherapy the combination of the molecularly targeted experimental drug veliparib plus carboplatin showed sufficient improvement to meet the pre specified threshold for graduation from the trial signifying a high likelihood for success in a modest confirmatory phase neoadjuvant trial in the triple negative subset likewise the experimental drug neratinib was found to have sufficient improvement in the pcr rate for patients in the her positive hr negative subset that it too was graduated from the i spy trial because there are so many subtypes of breast cancer and because we always test drugs in the metastatic and then adjuvant setting finding effective therapies is a very difficult and long process the i spy platform allows therapies to be tested and evaluated in more expeditious cost effective ways said laura j esserman md mba a professor of surgery and radiology and director of the carol franc buck breast care center at ucsf helen diller family comprehensive cancer center in san francisco principal investigator on the i spy trial and a senior author on the reports these results provide valuable information on which drugs should proceed to confirmatory trials to improve outcomes for patients with extremely aggressive cancers that put women at risk for early recurrence and death for these patients time is of the essence in particular finding drug combinations that are effective and less toxic is extremely important the new studies show that by using the i spy model to match therapies with biomarker subsets we can create trials that are more focused smaller and faster thereby exposing more patients to effective treatments a major achievement in the progression of i spy has been significantly reducing the time it takes to move forward from initiation of discussions with drug companies to enrollment of the first patients i spy has compressed this timeline from an average timeframe of months to five months the i spy study start up period takes approximately days with more than percent of the sites opening and enrolling patients as opposed to the traditional study start up timing of to months with less than percent of the sites opening and enrolling more than investigators from the nation s most prestigious and innovative cancer research centers co authored the two nejm articles with hundreds of staff and investigators involved in i spy overall in addition to dr esserman the principal investigators for i spy is donald a berry phd a professor in the department of biostatistics at the university of texas md anderson cancer center and founder of berry consultants a complete list of the participating centers and investigators is provided in a supplementary appendix available at nejm org the i spy trial is sponsored by quantumleap healthcare collaborative a non profit foundation that was established in as a collaboration between medical researchers at university of california at san francisco and silicon valley entrepreneurs quantumleap s mission is to accelerate transfer of high impact research in clinical processes and systems technology into widespread adoption so that patients and physicians can benefit from the research as soon as practicable quantumleap provides operational financial and regulatory oversight to i spy and is also the sponsor of the i spy phase program and i spy a companion phase confirmatory trial that is in development,1

newswise for three years andrew harder wondered if he had prostate cancer in he had routine blood work that revealed an elevated prostate specific antigen psa level when psa is above nanograms per milliliter of blood it can be one of the first signs of a prostate tumor harder s psa was by the time harder saw a urologist it had skyrocketed to his doctor recommended the traditional next step a transrectal ultrasound trus biopsy which involves taking random tissue samples from cross sections of the prostate over the course of two years harder an mri technologist would have three trus biopsies they were all inconclusive it is frustrating to have a bunch of biopsies with a rising psa and no proof of cancer harder said after harder s third biopsy his urologist was ready to throw in the towel and that s when harder was referred to jinxing yu m d at vcu health by then harder s psa was around yu is the director of oncologic and prostate imaging in the department of radiology at vcu over the past five years he has developed diagnostic techniques using mri technology to investigate difficult cases like harder s after one mri yu found harder s tumor after that yu performed a targeted biopsy guided by the mri scanner allowing him to take tissue samples directly from the tumor harder finally had a diagnosis in he started on a treatment plan hormone therapy for six months to shrink the tumor and prostate and then external beam radiation to finish the job today his psa is normal other patients who continue to hit a brick wall with negative results from trus biopsies yet persistently high psa levels may not be as fortunate a patient had trus biopsies and his doctors still couldn t find a tumor yu said if you do not have this kind of advanced imaging sometimes a patient runs into a situation when a tumor can t be found and treated because it s too late it has already metastasized he ends up diagnosed with cancer only after the tumor has spread to his bone or lymph nodes years later precise imaging leads to detection magnetic resonance imaging and targeted biopsy for the prostate have provided relief for patients like harder who have not been able to get an accurate diagnosis when caught early prostate cancer is highly treatable much like someone would have an mri to investigate the cause of back pain the technology gives doctors eyes on what is happening in prostate tissue vcu medical center is one of the major teaching hospitals in the country doing advanced multiparametric mri which involves taking three different types of imaging sequences of the prostate each of the sequences t weighted imaging diffusion weighted imaging and dynamic contrast enhanced imaging tells a story and together they can be used to make a diagnosis with more than percent accuracy interpreting a prostate mri to be able to correctly diagnose cancer is a skill that can take years to develop yu and his team look for certain patterns that are typical of cancer on each of the different sequences if we put those characteristic features together from each sequence then we can say with a high degree of confidence that this area is concerning for cancer and potentially target it for biopsy said sarah winks m d an attending physician in the department of radiology an mri can also help determine how aggressive a tumor is yu said and indicates if the tumor extends outside of the prostate and involves other areas all information that helps urologists and radiation oncologists determine the best course of treatment traditional meets emerging technology in addition to enhancing detection of prostate cancer magnetic resonance technology also enhances the biopsy process with a procedure called magnetic resonance ultrasound fusion biopsy mri scans are overlaid with real time ultrasound images to guide the biopsy needle to the tumor in vcu health s department of radiology supported by the division of urology in the department of surgery purchased ultrasound mri fusion biopsy equipment prior to this yu s team had performed targeted mri biopsies with the patient being moved in and out of the mri scanner as the needle was guided to the target area a sort of stop motion procedure that could take up to an hour the new equipment has simplified and shortened the process to about minutes a study published in by the center for cancer research found that fusion biopsy is percent more accurate in diagnosing high risk aggressive cancers than a trus biopsy it is also much better at finding tumors in the anterior part of the prostate near where harder s tumor was located yu credits the technology and also having a dedicated team that can perform multiparametric mri read the mri scans and conduct biopsies with a very high success rate at most places there will be a radiologist reading the mr image and a clinician performing the biopsy the person reading the image and person putting in the needle is different yu said sometimes you don t get the same result we do both that s one of our strengths new path to diagnosis yu has seen how mri technology has changed prostate patients care five years ago percent of patients with prostate cancer or a high psa would never get any imaging yu said right now i think probably or percent get imaging sometimes these are patients pushing their doctors for a referral as one of yu s patients did last year last august jim grandon of colville washington discovered he had a psa of it was elevated from the measurement that he had registered for a few years the rising psa was cause for concern instead of going through with an immediate trus biopsy recommended by his urologist he decided to research next steps with just going in and doing a blind biopsy like most urologists will do you have anywhere from to percent success rate grandon said i found three or four places around the country with a biopsy success rate of over percent when i went back to my urologist he said why spend money flying around the country when we can take care of you here i said because percent is better than percent vcu medical center was one of the places grandon had researched to get his diagnostic testing done and a few phone calls later he was on a plane flying across the country to see yu on his second day in richmond grandon had an mri that showed a lesion the next day yu biopsied it on the fourth day grandon flew home and began researching treatment options he opted for brachytherapy followed by external radiation at a clinic closer to home and recently completed his treatment a change in care more and more physicians are hearing about and understanding the benefits of mri technology for prostate care which has also been helpful in preventing overdiagnosis and overtreatment according to the center for cancer research study mri targeted biopsies detect percent fewer low risk tumors these are tumors that would have never developed into a life threatening cancer but might lead a doctor and patient to treat it unnecessarily when yu started prostate mri screening in his team performed about scans per year now with the support of massey cancer center urology and radiation oncology they are doing about multiparametric mri and imaging guided biopsies per year he estimates the volume will continue to increase because vcu will attract patients not only from the greater richmond area but also patients such as grandon from other parts of the country yu hopes the advanced technology means positive changes in the standard of care he speculates that in the same way women have a baseline mammogram men would have a baseline prostate mri and periodic magnetic resonance scans if warranted by bloodwork and family history,1
fort lauderdale fla july prnewswire new research published in lancet neurology and reported by cnn has found using a green tea extract decaffeinated in combination with cognitive training improves some measures of cognition and behavior in subjects with down syndrome eighty seven volunteers aged to with down syndrome were enrolled in the phase randomized controlled trial the study was conducted at the imim hospital del mar medical research institute in barcelona spain participants were randomly assigned to take the decaffeinated green tea extract or placebo for one year all subjects also underwent cognitive training during the month trial after one year of treatment functional brain scans fmri showed that epigallocatechin gallate egcg treated subjects had improved neuronal connectivity in certain brain regions participants who took the green tea extract also scored significantly better on assessments of visual recognition memory inhibitory control and adaptive behavior compared with those who took the placebo it s an important trial says dr steven hirsh director of clinical research for life extension in fort lauderdale fla the findings are very noteworthy and support further study in randomized controlled trials with larger sample sizes and durations it is very encouraging that this catechin egcg from green tea extract has the potential to benefit people with down syndrome down syndrome is a genetic condition that affects about americans individuals with down syndrome have an extra full or partial copy of chromosome the team of researchers led by dr rafael de la torre program director of imim hospital del mar medical research institute and study co principal investigator and dr mara dierssen group leader at center for genomic regulation barcelona spain and study co principal investigator proposed that egcg might have conferred these benefits by inhibiting an enzyme called dyrk a which has been implicated in down syndrome and neurodegenerative conditions including alzheimer disease the level of dyrk a positive cells is elevated in certain regions of alzheimer disease patients brains and is roughly fold higher in the frontal cortex compared to normal brains dyrk a is implicated in the formation of neurofibrillary tangles via tau hyperphosphorylation and amyloid plaques both of which are features of alzheimer disease tea catechins may also modulate the damaging effects of amyloid beta several animal studies have found that egcg and related compounds from tea suppress amyloid beta induced cognitive dysfunction and neurotoxicity other possible mechanisms by which egcg may influence cognition include epigenetic regulation restoration of mitochondrial function and anti oxidative functions in an earlier pilot study supported by life extension drs de la torre and dierssen s team showed that three months of egcg treatment improved symptoms in individuals with down syndrome and in mice with a down syndrome like condition characterized by overexpression of dyrk a we are excited that the benefits observed in the early pilot and preclinical research extended to this larger trial says luke g huber nd mba vice president of product innovation and scientific development at life extension this new research adds to the growing body of evidence that suggests compounds in green tea such as egcg may support cognitive health in acknowledging the novelty of their findings and calling for more research the spanish research team noted that this study is the first well powered trial that shows improvement in adaptive behavior

international study finds effective less toxic way to treat brain tumors newswise charlotte n c july prnewswire usnewswire physicians from carolinas healthcare system s neurosciences institute and levine cancer institute are among the authors of a study that was accepted for publication by the journal of the american medical association jama the study released on july shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy these results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life anthony l asher md facs medical director at carolinas healthcare system s neurosciences institute and the senior author on the report and as well as stuart h burri md chairman department of radiation oncology at levine cancer institute began their research on this subject over years ago in charlotte north carolina along with dr paul brown at mayo clinic they spearheaded an international multi institutional randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor brain metastases by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness typical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation also known as stereotactic radiosurgery we discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases in other words cancer that travels to the brain reduces the number of new brain tumors over time however patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation says dr asher whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation adds dr burri interestingly the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival according to the american cancer society in there will be approximately million new cancer cases diagnosed in the united states almost one in four of those patients about will experience spread of their cancers to the brain in contrast and patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers respectively each year brain metastases are not only extremely common they are also a major source of disability in society says dr asher because of their location these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms such as headaches weakness or problems with speech and information processing thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients according to dr asher there are two primary objectives in cancer care to improve survivalto maintain or improve quality of life for patients the first and highest rule of medical care is do no harm says dr asher consistent with that obligation when it isn t possible to extend survival with various therapies it s absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments another way to state that principle for cancer care is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival it s important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life in this study although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone furthermore whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life in the past clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients daily function in response to various therapies said dr burri without those tests we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better at least in the short term however the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients drs asher and burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy the trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases this is a very relevant finding as over patients still receive whole brain radiation in the united states each year and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number typically three or less of brain lesions drs asher and burri along with their co investigators now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life having the research published in jama is validation of more than a decade of work says dr burri it is deeply satisfying to have developed an important scientific project work in close collaboration with other investigators to obtain support from the national cancer institute then carry the to carry the trial to completion with publication of impactful results in one of the leading medical journals in the world drs asher and burri are now working on a new method of focused therapy for tumors that have spread to the brain that combines radiation and surgery the technique was pioneered at levine cancer institute and they are looking to expand and further validate the approach with the national cancer

vaccinate girls and boys years and younger although vaccination rates in the united states remain low in the us only about percent of girls and percent of boys receive the three dose vaccination series the earlier the vaccine is given the more efficacious it can be this study focused on the benefit of vaccinating women years and older infection with hpv can take place at any time throughout adulthood and women in this age group may have already been exposed to hpv the study showed that women in this age group were still protected from hpv infections the scientists followed each woman for four to seven years they found that the vaccine protected the women against hpv infections during the follow up period and that the women were protected from many types of hpv across a broad age range

key points question does treatment with cetuximab and radiotherapy crt increase the rate of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy free survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma findings in this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial comparing crt vs radiotherapy alone in treated patients there was no difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation at years there was a and absolute improvement in laryngectomy free survival at and years respectively for crt vs radiotherapy alone meaning the results of this secondary subset analysis reveal a possible cetuximab related benefit in laryngeal preservation abstract importance the appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate unfortunately there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in the last years objective to assess the rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy free survival in patients receiving cetuximab and radiotherapy crt and patients receiving radiotherapy alone design setting and participants patients were enrolled in a multicenter open label stratified randomized phase study from april through march from centers in the united states and other countries a secondary subgroup analysis of patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma was undertaken rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy free survival were estimated by the kaplan meier method the hazard ratios hrs were calculated using a cox proportional hazards regression model quality of life was evaluated using the european organization for research and treatment of cancer core questionnaire and head and neck module main outcomes and measures laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy free survival results of the patients included in the trial treated patients with cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx were included in this analysis in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group the median range age of the patients was years in the crt group and years in the radiotherapy alone group in the crt group patients were male and were female in the radiotherapy alone group were male and were female the rates of laryngeal preservation at years were for crt vs for radiotherapy alone with an hr of ci p similarly the hr for laryngectomy free survival comparing crt vs radiotherapy alone was ci p this study was not powered to assess organ preservation median overall survival was ci vs ci months for the crt and radiotherapy alone groups respectively with an hr of ci no differences between treatments were reported regarding overall quality of life need for a feeding tube or speech conclusions and relevance the results of a possible cetuximab related laryngeal preservation benefit for patients with hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer are intriguing these results need to be interpreted in the context of a retrospective subset analysis with limited sample size trial registration clinicaltrials gov identifier nct introduction historically locoregionally advanced squamous cell cancers of the larynx or hypopharynx have been treated with surgical resection usually involving laryngectomy with or without postoperative radiotherapy although laryngectomy is an effective treatment investigators have sought therapeutic strategies that result in voice preservation various modifications of surgical techniques have been explored alternatively in the early s investigators evaluated curative primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery as an option for these patients retrospective studies that compared primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery to initial surgery with postoperative radiotherapy found similar rates of survival in patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers after the realization that many patients could avoid total laryngectomy with the use of primary radiotherapy several combination chemoradiotherapy strategies were introduced for patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers in large phase randomized clinical trials induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy demonstrated equivalent overall survival compared with surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers more recently the radiation therapy oncology group trial revealed that radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin resulted in a superior laryngeal preservation rate compared with induction with cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for these advanced laryngeal cancers however this treatment did not produce a survival benefit the appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate unfortunately there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in large database studies examining the last years of care investigators have reported that poor follow up may contribute to the potential for larger and less curable recurrences and surgeons experienced with radiotherapy with salvage surgery need to be involved as early as possible the analysis described in this report was performed to assess the laryngeal preservation rates of patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers who were entered into a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab and radiotherapy crt compared with radiotherapy alone this group of patients represents a subgroup patients of a larger population patients that also included patients with oropharyngeal cancers it is noteworthy that this randomized clinical trial was not designed to enroll a sufficient number of patients to definitively and prospectively address the subject of the analysis reported herein previous reports of the overall randomized clinical trial found locoregional control and survival advantages associated with the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy methods patients patients were enrolled in the multicenter open label stratified randomized phase study from april through march from centers in the united states and other countries patients who entered the trial had stage iii or iv nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx hypopharynx or larynx figure and table patients were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed stage iii or iv squamous cell carcinoma had measurable disease had no distant metastases had no prior therapy for the tumor under study and were medically suitable to undergo definitive radiotherapy this subgroup includes the patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers the protocol was approved by the ethics review boards at the participating institutions and all the patients provided written informed consent patients were initially evaluated with a comprehensive head and neck examination which included panendoscopy the primary tumors and lymph nodes were staged by the american joint committee on cancer staging classification of initial evaluation included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region and chest radiography patients began treatment within weeks after this initial evaluation as determined by the randomization procedure patients who underwent no surgery or less extensive operations were censored at death or date of last contact treatment the primary radiotherapy was delivered with curative intent investigators selected of radiation fractionation regimens once daily twice daily or concomitant boost regimen figure cervical lymph node drainage regions considered to be at high risk for subclinical disease were treated with a dose of to gy the primary tumor and gross nodal disease received full dose radiotherapy gy depending on fractionation however if a postoperative neck dissection was planned gross nodal disease could be treated with gy for patients randomized to crt cetuximab treatment consisted of an initial dose of mg m and was delivered as a minute intravenous infusion this initial dose was delivered week before the initiation of crt patients received weekly cetuximab infusions during the radiotherapy treatment seven weekly infusions were delivered at a dose of mg m for a period of minutes each for patients who were scheduled to have a planned neck dissection surgery was scheduled to take place to weeks after completion of crt or radiotherapy alone evaluations evaluations including physical examination hematologic testing and chemical profiles were performed weekly for the duration of the study a pharmacologic profile was also performed weekly on patients receiving cetuximab infusion crt group patients provided a history and underwent a physical examination which included a fiberoptic examination of the tumor as well as an assessment of all study end points at required time points after the completion of treatment posttreatment assessments were performed and weeks after completion of radiotherapy patients who were scheduled for a planned postoperative neck dissection could have their week assessment at the week time point along with posttreatment computed tomography subsequently patients were evaluated every months during the first and second years they were evaluated semiannually during years to these follow up assessments included imaging studies consisting of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region quality of life the instruments used in this study were the european organization for research and treatment of cancer quality of life questionnaire core version and the quality of life head and neck module the self administered core questionnaire consisted of questions and incorporated functional scales symptom scales and a global health and quality of life scale the remaining single items assessed additional symptoms commonly reported by patients with cancer as well as the perceived financial effect of disease and treatment all scales and single items met the standards for reliability the item module comprised multi item scale and a series of single items assessing head and neck associated symptoms and adverse effects from conventional therapy statistical analysis the randomization was not stratified by primary site of cancer hence the results presented below are a retrospective analysis of the selected subset of patients a consort flow diagram was included with the original publication of the trial a trial profile for the analysis presented here is shown in figure the primary end point of the study was to examine differences in the rate of locoregional disease control maintained for year the duration of locoregional control was defined as the absence of locoregional disease progression at the scheduled follow up visits and was determined through a masked review of the investigator generated data by an independent committee of experts the duration of locoregional control was from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease or death from any cause overall survival was calculated from randomization to death from any cause tumor present in a neck dissection which was performed for any reason after weeks after radiotherapy constituted locoregional progression distribution of time to event parameters was estimated by the kaplan meier method and treatment effects were compared using a log rank test the cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the nonstratified hazard ratio hr the kaplan meier method was also used to estimate the rate of preservation of larynx patients who underwent no surgery or lesser operations were censored at death or date of last contact results characteristics of the patients a total of patients participated in the study and were included in the subanalysis in the crt group or in the radiotherapy alone group most patients from both treatment groups were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation regimen the treatment groups were well balanced with respect to sex tumor stage node stage table and the rate of neck surgery in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group treatment adherence the median durations of treatment were and days for once daily twice daily or concomitant boost respectively for patients treated with crt and and days respectively for patients treated with radiotherapy alone for patients who received cetuximab the median number of cetuximab infusions was range the median cumulative cetuximab dose was mg m range mg m the number of patients who received or more cetuximab infusions was the radiotherapy quality assurance review found that the mean and median doses for the once daily twice daily and concomitant boost regimens were and gy and gy and and gy respectively these doses were similar in both treatment groups radiotherapy adherence for patients who received crt or radiotherapy alone was balanced received crt and received radiotherapy alone as planned or with minor deviation a total of patients were treated as planned or with minor deviation major acceptable deviations in the crt and radiotherapy alone groups were found in and patients and major unacceptable deviations were observed in and patients respectively a total of and patients in these respective groups were not evaluable for a radiation quality assurance review the differences in radiotherapy adherence between the treatment groups were not statistically significant neck dissections were performed in patients treated with crt and patients treated with radiotherapy alone efficacy locoregional control was the primary end point of the phase study for this subgroup of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers locoregional control was slightly improved for patients who received crt compared with radiotherapy alone hr ci table the year rates of locoregional control were in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group survival was also slightly improved for patients who received crt compared with radiotherapy alone hr ci table the year survival rates were in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group the rates of laryngeal preservation no need for salvage laryngectomy were at and years in the crt group compared with at years and at years in the radiotherapy alone group the and absolute improvements in the rates of laryngeal preservation at and years respectively favored crt compared with radiotherapy alone figure however this improvement was not statistically significant hr ci p in addition there was a and absolute improvement in laryngectomy free survival at and years respectively again these differences did not reach statistical significance hr ci p figure safety the most frequently reported adverse events are given in table the frequency of grades and mucositis stomatitis and odynophagia was not significantly different among patients who received crt compared with radiotherapy alone patients who received crt had a greater rate of acneiform rash compared with patients who received radiotherapy alone table chills fever and headache were the only toxic events reported to occur at any grade with significantly higher frequency p p and p respectively in patients in the crt group than in the radiotherapy alone group however their incidences were low chills vs fever vs headache vs quality of life the quality of life responses were evaluated in a longitudinal design in all patients baseline assessment was performed at or just after randomization subsequent assessments took place before the beginning of the fourth week of radiotherapy at the week posttreatment evaluation and at the every month follow up evaluations of year plots of mean changes in global health status use of a feeding tube or speech problems reveal no differences between the treatment groups figure a positive value in change indicates an improvement for the patient differences in mean changes in swallowing at radiotherapy week in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group p loss of appetite at radiotherapy week in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group p nausea at week after radiotherapy in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group p coughing at radiotherapy week in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group p and at week after radiotherapy in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group p constipation at month in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group p and cognitive functioning at month in the crt group and in the radiotherapy alone group p were not seen at the other time points discussion when laryngectomy is the primary treatment for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers patients gradually adjust to the loss of natural phonation but the condition substantially interferes with normal communication and social interactions in addition although the effect of the procedure on voice frequently receives the greatest consideration the presence of the stoma may also adversely affect patients quality of life in the analysis reported herein laryngeal preservation rates were studied in a subgroup of patients who were part of a large phase trial that compared primary radiotherapy with or without the antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab the use of crt produced a higher rate of laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone for patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers although the difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation between the groups did not reach statistical significance the initial trial was not powered to assess this subgroup question the hr of is a strong indicator that cetuximab when added to radiotherapy may improve laryngeal preservation the rate of laryngeal preservation at years for crt found in this trial is similar to the rate reported for the use of radiotherapy and concomitant cisplatin in radiation therapy oncology group trial n patients who undergo a laryngectomy often experience a difficult adjustment process even when the patient achieves a certain level of comfort with various techniques of artificial speech the ability to communicate with others is hampered investigations have explored both the patient s and the interviewer s perceptions of the patient s difficulty with communication after laryngectomy of interest the interviewers perceived the patients impairment with communication as a much greater infringement on quality of life compared with the patients perceptions patients who underwent laryngectomy believed that interference with social activities resulted in a greater detrimental effect regarding their quality of life compared with the interviewers perception of this factor therefore patients have their own perceptions as well as the perceptions of others as potential hurdles to normal activities after laryngectomy the perception of life without a larynx plays an important role in a patient s treatment decision in a recent trial from france patients were queried about the treatment choices they might make if they faced the diagnosis of advanced laryngeal cancer only stated that they would not consider options with a lower chance of cure if told that the best option with respect to survival was total laryngectomy however their enthusiasm for seeking laryngeal preserving options waned when told about potential adverse effects such as tracheostomy or permanent gastrostomy an older report of interviews with firefighters and executives who were asked to envision that they had advanced laryngeal cancer determined that they were willing to accept a to reduction in life expectancy for a laryngeal preserving treatment compared with total laryngectomy these studies demonstrate the importance of reviewing options and potential adverse effects with patients before making a decision regarding the best treatment considering the importance of laryngeal function many head and neck cancer treatments have been directed toward the goal of laryngeal preservation one of the largest randomized clinical trials was designed to evaluate laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone concomitant chemoradiotherapy and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy each treatment group included at least patients thus providing much greater statistical power than the current communication the use of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone with a hazard ratio of however the induction regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil did not improve laryngeal preservation over radiotherapy alone neither concomitant chemoradiotherapy nor induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone furthermore there were greater severe acute toxic effects from the chemoradiotherapy treatments compared with radiotherapy alone but no significant differences in severe late toxic effects were noted in the comparison of the treatment arms unfortunately the concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm had an increase in deaths not attributable to cancer compared with the other arms this finding needs to be explored further to determine whether undetected fatal late treatment toxic effects are greater with concomitant regimens although induction chemotherapy was not used in this trial it has been the subject of many past and recent assessments involving laryngeal preservation as well as other efficacy and safety outcomes a retrospective review of the phase tax trial induction chemotherapy comparing taxotere cisplatin and fluorouracil with standard cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by chemoradiation in locally advanced head and neck cancer in patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers revealed that induction chemotherapy of docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil n compared with cisplatin plus fluorouracil n followed by chemoradiotherapy with weekly carboplatin resulted in significantly improved overall survival p and progression free survival p for the docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil group among patients undergoing surgery laryngectomy free survival was also significantly greater with docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil p the tremplin radiotherapy with cisplatin versus radiotherapy with cetuximab after induction chemotherapy for larynx preservation trial compared the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy using docetaxel cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin n or cetuximab n for laryngeal preservation no differences were found in laryngeal preservation laryngeal function preservation or overall survival between the regimens newer studies such as decide docetaxel based chemotherapy plus or minus ic to decrease events in head and neck cancer and paradigm combination chemotherapy and radiation in treating patients with stage iii or iv head and neck cancer suggest no overall benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy vs concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone conclusions the higher rate of laryngeal preservation that was achieved with the use of crt compared with radiotherapy alone was encouraging furthermore no significant increases in the most debilitating radiotherapy induced toxic effects such as mucositis stomatitis and dysphagia were observed this treatment approach warrants further evaluation in larger populations to fully assess the potential value of cetuximab or other molecular targeting agents to augment

newswise eating a type of powdered food supplement based on a molecule produced by bacteria in the gut reduces cravings for high calorie foods such as chocolate cake and pizza a new study suggests scientists from imperial college london and the university of glasgow asked volunteers to consume a milkshake that either contained an ingredient called inulin propionate ester or a type of fibre called inulin previous studies have shown bacteria in the gut release a compound called propionate when they digest the fibre inulin which can signal to the brain to reduce appetite however the inulin propionate ester supplement releases much more propionate in the intestines than inulin alone after drinking the milkshakes the participants in the current study underwent an mri scan where they were shown pictures of various low or high calorie foods such as salad fish and vegetables or chocolate cake and pizza the team found that when volunteers drank the milkshake containing inulin propionate ester they had less activity in areas of their brain linked to reward but only when looking at the high calorie foods these areas called the caudate and the nucleus accumbens found in the centre of the brain have previously been linked to food cravings and the motivation to want a food the volunteers also had to rate how appealing they found the foods the results showed when they drank the milkshake with the inulin propionate ester supplement they rated the high calorie foods as less appealing in a second part of the study which is published in july edition of the american journal of clinical nutrition the volunteers were given a bowl of pasta with tomato sauce and asked to eat as much as they like when participants drank the inulin propionate ester they ate per cent less pasta than when they drank the milkshake that contained inulin alone in a previous research study by the same team published in they found that overweight volunteers who added the inulin propionate ester supplement to their food every day gained less weight over six months compared to volunteers who added only inulin to their meals professor gary frost senior author of the study from the department of medicine at imperial said our previous findings showed that people who ate this ingredient gained less weight but we did not know why this study is filling in a missing bit of the jigsaw and shows that this supplement can decrease activity in brain areas associated with food reward at the same time as reducing the amount of food they eat he added that eating enough fibre to naturally produce similar amounts of propionate would be difficult the amount of inulin propionate ester used in this study was g which previous studies show increases propionate production by times to get the same increase from fibre alone we would need to eat around g a day at the moment the uk average is g claire byrne a phd researcher also from the department of medicine explained that using inulin propionate ester as a food ingredient may help prevent weight gain if we add this to foods it could reduce the urge to consume high calorie foods she added that some people s gut bacteria may naturally produce more propionate than others which may be why some people seem more naturally predisposed to gain weight dr tony goldstone co senior author of the study from the department of medicine added this study adds to our previous brain imaging studies in people who have had gastric bypass surgery for obesity these show that altering how the gut works can change not only appetite in general but also change how the brain responds when they see high calorie foods and how appealing they find the foods to be dr douglas morrison author of the paper from the scottish universities environmental research centre at the university of glasgow commented we developed inulin propionate ester to investigate the role of propionate produced by the gut microbiota in human health this study illustrates very nicely that signals produced by the gut microbiota are important for appetite regulation and food choice this study also sheds new light on how diet the gut microbiome and health are inextricably linked adding to our understanding of how feeding our gut microbes with dietary fibre is important for healthy living the research was funded by the national institute for health research imperial biomedical research centre and the biotechnology and biological sciences research council,1
newswise june novato and los angeles ca results from quantitative mri and neuropsychological testing show unprecedented improvements in ten patients with early alzheimer s disease ad or its precursors following treatment with a programmatic and personalized therapy results from an approach dubbed metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration are now available online in the journal aging the study which comes jointly from the buck institute for research on aging and the ucla easton laboratories for neurodegenerative disease research is the first to objectively show that memory loss in patients can be reversed and improvement sustained using a complex point therapeutic personalized program that involves comprehensive changes in diet brain stimulation exercise optimization of sleep specific pharmaceuticals and vitamins and multiple additional steps that affect brain chemistry all of these patients had either well defined mild cognitive impairment mci subjective cognitive impairment sci or had been diagnosed with ad before beginning the program said author dale bredesen md a professor at the buck institute and professor at the easton laboratories for neurodegenerative disease research at ucla who noted that patients who had had to discontinue work were able to return to work and those struggling at their jobs were able to improve their performance follow up testing showed some of the patients going from abnormal to normal one of the more striking cases involved a year old professional man whose neuropsychological testing was compatible with a diagnoses of mci and whose pet scan showed reduced glucose utilization indicative of ad an mri showed hippocampal volume at only the th percentile for his age after months on the protocol a follow up mri showed a dramatic increase of his hippocampal volume to the th percentile with an associated absolute increase in volume of nearly percent in another instance a year old professional man and entrepreneur who was in the process of shutting down his business went on the protocol after years of progressive memory loss after six months his wife co workers and he noted improvement in memory a life long ability to add columns of numbers rapidly in his head returned and he reported an ability to remember his schedule and recognize faces at work after months on the protocol he returned for follow up quantitative neuropsychological testing results showed marked improvements in all categories with his long term recall increasing from the rd to th percentile he is expanding his business another patient a year old woman who noted progressive difficulty with word finding and facial recognition went on the protocol after undergoing quantitative neuropsychological testing at a major university she had been told she was in the early stages of cognitive decline and was therefore ineligible for an alzheimer s prevention program after several months on the protocol she noted a clear improvement in recall reading navigating vocabulary mental clarity and facial recognition her foreign language ability had returned nine months after beginning the program she did a repeat of the neuropsychological testing at the same university site she no longer showed evidence of cognitive decline all but one of the ten patients included in the study are at genetic risk for ad carrying at least one copy of the apoe allele five of the patients carry two copies of apoe which gives them a fold increased risk of developing ad we re entering a new era said bredesen the old advice was to avoid testing for apoe because there was nothing that could be done about it now we re recommending that people find out their genetic status as early as possible so they can go on prevention sixty five percent of the alzheimer s cases in this country involve apoe with seven million people carrying two copies of the apoe allele bredesen s systems based approach to reverse memory loss follows the abject failure of monotherapies designed to treat ad and the success of combination therapies to treat other chronic illnesses such as cardiovascular disease cancer and hiv bredesen says decades of biomedical research both in his and other labs has revealed that an extensive network of molecular interactions is involved in ad pathogenesis suggesting that a broader based therapeutic approach may be more effective imagine having a roof with holes in it and your drug patched one hole very well the drug may have worked a single hole may have been fixed but you still have other leaks and so the underlying process may not be affected much bredesen said we think addressing multiple targets within the molecular network may be additive or even synergistic and that such a combinatorial approach may enhance drug candidate performance as well while encouraged by the results of the study bredesen admits more needs to be done the magnitude of improvement in these ten patients is unprecedented providing additional objective evidence that this programmatic approach to cognitive decline is highly effective bredesen said even though we see the far reaching implications of this success we also realize that this is a very small study that needs to be replicated in larger numbers at various sites plans for larger studies are underway cognitive decline is often listed as the major concern of older adults already alzheimer s disease affects approximately million americans and million people globally without effective prevention and treatment the prospects for the future are bleak by it s estimated that million people globally will have the disease including million americans leading to potential bankruptcy of the medicare system unlike several other chronic illnesses alzheimer s disease is on the rise recent estimates suggest that ad has become the third leading cause of death in the united states behind cardiovascular disease and cancer the bredesen protocol dr bredesen s book describing for a lay audience the interventions described in this paper will be released by penguin random house in may dr bredesen hopes to eventually transform the perception and reality of alzheimer s disease from a death sentence to a preventable reversible condition citation reversal of cognitive decline in alzheimer s disease other collaborators on the study include edwin c amos jonathan canick mary ackerley

newswise chicago a single breath may be all it takes to identify the return of lung cancer after surgery according to a study posted online today by the annals of thoracic surgery exhaled breath contains thousands of volatile organic compounds vocs that vary in composition and pattern depending on a person s health status a subset of four vocs called carbonyl compounds because of their carbon base have been discovered in the exhaled breath of lung cancer patients being able to identify this lung cancer signature through a simple breath test has emerged as one of the most promising ways to diagnose the disease now the test is being used to monitor for disease recurrence erin m schumer md mph victor van berkel md phd and colleagues from the university of louisville analyzed breath samples collected before and after surgery from lung cancer patients and compared their carbonyl vocs levels with samples from healthy patients the researchers found a significant decrease in overall carbonyl voc levels following surgery in fact three of the four carbonyl vocs normalized after surgery matching levels in the control group the rapid normalization of almost all of the four compounds after surgery provides strong evidence that they are directly produced by the tumor environment said dr schumer this study confirms that the technology is accurate lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death the american cancer society acs estimates that more than americans will be diagnosed with lung cancer this year and more than lung cancer patients will die that translates to lung cancer deaths per day in the united states dr schumer said those grim statistics underscore the need for early detection we hope that breath analysis will allow us to diagnose patients with primary or recurrent lung cancer long before they suffer from symptoms when we have more options for treating them giving them the best chance for cure currently lung cancer patients are followed after surgery with chest computed tomography ct scans which can be inconvenient expensive and expose the patient to radiation we hope that the breath analysis can serve as the primary screening tool for cancer recurrence and a ct scan ordered only if the breath test suggests that there has been a change said dr van berkel how the breath test worksthe process of breath analysis is relatively simple the patient blows a single breath into a specialized balloon the balloon is then connected to a pump that pulls the breath over a small microchip smaller than a quarter trapping the chemicals the microchip is sent to the lab where the chemicals are analyzed within hours breath collection can be performed in the doctor s office the pump is reusable the balloon microchip and lab test together cost around all supporting the increasing acceptance of breath tests as a cost effective easy to perform non invasive and rapid option for the diagnosis of lung cancer the great potential with breath analysis is detecting lung cancer at any point both as a primary screening tool and to follow patients after disease has been treated said dr van berkel the technology is pretty robust our next step is getting approval from the fda schumer e black m bousamra m trivedi j li m fu x van berkel v normalization of exhaled carbonyl compounds following lung cancer resection ann thoracic surg doi j athoracsur note this work was supported by the coulter foundation v foundation national science foundation and bill and melinda gates foundation in addition drs bousamra van berkel and fu disclose a financial relationship with breath diagnostics inc for a copy of the annals article contact jennifer bagley at or founded in the society of thoracic surgeons is a not for profit organization representing more than cardiothoracic surgeons researchers and allied health care professionals worldwide who are dedicated to ensuring the best possible outcomes for surgeries of the heart lung and esophagus as well as other surgical procedures within the chest the society s mission is to enhance the ability of cardiothoracic surgeons to provide the highest quality patient care through education research and advocacy the annals of thoracic surgery is the official journal of sts and the southern thoracic surgical association it has a year impact factor of the highest of any cardiothoracic surgery journal worldwide,1
newswise new brunswick n j june according to the american cancer society the chance of being diagnosed with thyroid cancer has risen rapidly in the united states in recent years this appears to be due to increased use of technology to detect thyroid nodules that may not otherwise been found previously most thyroid cancers can be treated successfully but advanced cases can be difficult to treat especially if they do not respond to radioactive iodine rai therapy new treatments called immunotherapies are being explored they target a certain protein that has the ability to shut down t cells a part of white blood cells that help the body fight infection and disease naturally in blocking this activity these new immunotherapy drugs help t cells get back to work in protecting the body janice m mehnert md director of the phase i and developmental therapeutics program at rutgers cancer institute of new jersey is the lead author of research highlighting the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab and its effect on advanced thyroid cancer the work is being presented at the american society of clinical oncology asco annual meeting which begins tomorrow in chicago dr mehnert who is also a medical oncologist in the melanoma and soft tissue oncology program at rutgers cancer institute shares more about the research q how was the study structured a at the time our abstract was submitted patients with a diagnosis of advanced or metastatic papillary or follicular thyroid cancer who failed prior standard therapy were accrued from multiple international sites participants received mg of pembrolizumab every two weeks for up to months or until confirmed progression or unacceptable toxicity safety tolerability and response were assessed every eight weeks for the first six months and every weeks thereafter q what did you find a at the time we reported our results six of the patients remained on treatment of those who completed therapy two patients had a partial response for an overall response rate of percent and there was a stable disease rate of percent the six month overall survival rate was percent and the six month progression free survival rate was percent updated results will be announced at the annual meeting there were no treatment related deaths or therapy discontinuations due to drug related adverse effects overall pembrolizumab shows promising antitumor activity in advanced cases of follicular or papillary thyroid cancer which progressed on standard treatment the clinical benefit of pembrolizumab in advanced thyroid cancer will be further studied in a follow up phase ii clinical trial that is now ongoing to try to discover biomarkers which predict response to treatment with pembrolizumab q how are immunotherapy drugs changing the landscape of cancer treatment a although many patients treated do not respond when immunotherapy does induce responses in patients with advanced cancers these responses may be very long lasting in terms of disease control as well at least when used as single agents these agents tend to confer side effects that patients find much more tolerable than those associated with chemotherapy it s an exciting time in early phase drug development when we are observing these results in so many different types of cancer additional information is available at,1
newswise an international team led by researchers at the austrian institute of molecular biotechnology imba in vienna and the university of maryland school of medicine in baltimore discovered that genetically determined breast cancer can be largely prevented by blocking a bone gene an already approved drug could be quickly available and would then be the first breast cancer prevention drug about one in eight women will develop invasive breast cancer over the course of her lifetime causes can be the use of synthetic sex hormones and other environmental factors but also gene mutations like in the brca gene breast cancer us actress angelina jolie who underwent a preventive double mastectomy is the most famous carrier of a faulty brca gene on average women with this mutation have an up to lifetime risk of developing breast cancer tumors usually develop early in life until now prophylactic surgery is the only procedure which significantly reduces the breast cancer risk but which is also often associated with postoperative complications in josef penninger the scientific director of imba in vienna and his team have shown that sex hormones can trigger breast cancer schramek et al nature through proteins called rankl and its receptor rank which are key factors in bone metabolism rankl and rank also link sex hormones to breast cells by providing signals telling the breast cells to grow this occurs normally in every woman during pregnancy and the menstruation cycle however if deregulated mammary cells start to divide and multiply and fail to die when they should ultimately resulting in breast cancer a multinational research effort now made the discovery that rankl is also the main driver of brca mutation driven breast cancer in the current study verena sigl graduate student from penninger s research group showed that blocking the rankl rank system in brca mutant mice led to largely normal mammary glands whereas invasive carcinomas could be found in the control group to determine the relevance of their results for humans scientists in vienna and toronto isolated breast tissue cells from women who had undergone preventive mastectomy because of their brca mutation in the human cell culture too rankl inhibition led to a significant reduction of growth and spreading of breast tissue cells moreover the scientists together with colleagues in barcelona and from the cimba consortium mapping more than women showed that genetic variants in the rank gene are associated with a higher risk of developing breast cancer in women who carry brca and also brca mutations our finding is so exciting because there is already an approved drug against rankl called denosumab it is an antibody with very few side effects which binds tightly to rankl thereby inhibiting its ability to act based on our discovery the already approved drug denosumab or other future drugs that will block rankl rank could be used for breast cancer prevention in brca mutation carriers explains verena sigl scientists at the university of maryland school of medicine in baltimore have already tried the preventive use of a rankl blocking drug in mice animals carrying brca mutations were divided into two groups in the control group multiple early breast cancer lesions developed the second group received rankl blockade treatment for prevention with the result that virtually no malignant changes in breast tissue could be observed even over a longer period of observation careful phase iii clinical trials are now needed to confirm the efficacy in humans thereafter any woman who has been tested positive for a brca mutation could take rankl blockade as prevention measure to reduce her dramatically increased breast cancer risk josef penninger adds this work is a great example of an international collaboration of many scientists with one grand vision prevention of breast cancer cancer prevention is one of the key issues we face in medicine today a world where much fewer women will get breast cancer in the first place we have also shown that rankl rank are critically involved in sex hormone driven breast cancer if the uncovered mechanism indeed works in the prevention of breast cancer in high risk patients this could possibly be used to prevent breast cancer in general one door for breast cancer prevention has now been opened and this can be tested very fast the present work is the result of international collaboration scientists from austria imba akh wien participated as well as researchers from the university of maryland school of medicine in baltimore and the university of maryland baltimore county baltimore usa toronto canada and barcelona spain see original publication for details cimba josef penninger s studies at imba are largely supported by the million us innovator award through the us department of defense,1
fairfield n j may prnewswire medimetriks in collaboration with otsuka announces the successful completion of a phase trial of mm previously known as opa in atopic dermatitis ad mm is a topical phosphodiesterase pde inhibitor under development for the treatment of ad results showed a therapeutic benefit as measured by percentage change in easi score and improvement in iga score mm is expected to be the nd topical pde inhibitor available in the us and may offer unique benefits for patients suffering from ad medimetriks pharmaceuticals inc today announces the publication of phase results for mm previously referred to as opa a novel topical non steroidal phosphodiesterase iv pde inhibitor for the treatment of mild to moderate atopic dermatitis the successful results of the phase trial of mm have been published by the journal of the american academy of dermatology jaad the leading peer reviewed journal in dermatology the randomized double blind vehicle controlled study in patients showed that mm demonstrates a statistically significant effect on the primary endpoints versus vehicle as measured by improvement in iga score investigators global assessment and percentage change in easi score eczema area and severity index the mean percentage improvement in baseline easi score was notable very early at week vs for vehicle p and at week vs for vehicle p these effects were sustained through week of the study mm was also associated with improvement in patient reported outcomes most notably rapid and sustained itch relief with visual analog scale scores showing improvement from moderate to mild within the first week mean change p mm a pde inhibitor reduces inflammation in affected skin by inhibiting production of cytokines and chemical mediators that are believed to cause the signs and symptoms of atopic dermatitis in particular mm exhibits highly selective inhibitory activity against pde subtype b an enzyme that may play a significant role in inflammation mm is expected to be the nd topical pde inhibitor in the market after the potential approval of anacor pharmaceuticals crisaborole product the results of the phase study suggest that mm represents a potentially safe effective and well tolerated non steroidal treatment for mild to moderate atopic dermatitis said linda stein gold md director of clinical research department of dermatology at henry ford hospital and co author of the article based on the results of this study it appears that mm could address an important unmet need in dermatology we are pleased that jaad the most respected peer reviewed journal in dermatology published the phase results said bradley glassman chairman and chief executive officer of medimetriks we believe these phase results demonstrate compelling evidence of mm s capacity to be a leading topical pde inhibitor and are aggressively developing mm for atopic dermatitis in the us atopic dermatitis patients have few treatment options and medimetriks is dedicated to addressing this important unmet need the jaad article discussing the phase results can be found by visiting www jaad org about atopic dermatitis atopic dermatitis ad is a chronic inflammatory skin condition characterized by red swollen and cracked skin with intense itching the onset of ad occurs most commonly between and months of age with approximately of patients developing the condition in the first year of life and by years of age the majority of affected individuals have resolution of disease during childhood although to of patients maintain the condition throughout their lives a small percentage of the population develops first symptoms as adults it has been estimated that approximately million people are living with ad in the u s and this disease accounts for up to of patient visits to dermatology offices current treatments for atopic dermatitis include topical corticosteroids and topical calcineurin inhibitors topical steroids are typically used as first line therapies and are effective anti inflammatory agents however topical steroids may be associated with local and systemic side effects when used for extended periods of time including skin atrophy acne and telangiectasias locally and hpa axis suppression systemically topical calcineurin inhibitors tcis are recommended as second line treatment for people with atopic dermatitis who are at risk of steroid related side effects tcis carry boxed warnings about a possible association with skin malignancies and lymphoma although studies have not demonstrated a clear link their use can be limited by local adverse reactions such as burning and stinging about mm medimetriks has sole exclusive us rights to mm discovered by otsuka mm is an investigational non steroidal topical anti

a key objective of medication assisted treatment for opioid use disorder is to reduce or eliminate the use of illicit opioids the results from the present phase study demonstrate that cam blocks effectively the subjective effects of opioid challenges with hydromorphone including limiting drug liking this study provides clinical proof of concept that cam will be an effective treatment for opioid use disorder said behshad sheldon president and ceo of braeburn pharmaceuticals the current opioid crisis demands innovation and cam s novel technology is now one step closer to providing physicians and patients with a different approach to treating this deadly chronic disease the primary endpoint was met for both cam doses demonstrating blockade of the subjective effects of hydromorphone as measured by the drug liking visual analog scale furthermore cam was well tolerated across the course of treatment the study results show that cam provides rapid and extended blockade of opioid effects said fredrik tiberg president and ceo of camurus the results also confirm the dose selection in the current phase program and the potential of cam as a future treatment alternative for patients with opioid use disorder from initiation to long term maintenance the current study demonstrated that weekly injections of cam produced significant and robust opioid blockade a critical mechanism of efficacy for medications treating opioid dependence cam has the potential to alter the current treatment paradigm for opioid dependence said sharon walsh ph d professor of behavioral science and director of the center on drug and alcohol research university of kentucky because of its long acting properties cam may decrease patient and physician burden improve access to treatment and obviate public health concerns about illicit diversion of buprenorphine we were pleased to be involved in the development of cam and are hopeful that it will serve as another safe and effective therapeutic option for patients with opioid use disorder the ability of cam to produce a long lasting and robust blockade of hydromorphone induced drug liking is especially encouraging said sandra d comer ph d professor of neurobiology columbia university importantly the fact that cam will be given in the clinic by health providers should address concerns about diversion of buprenorphine for illicit use we feel that this medication with its ease of administration and flexible dosing capabilities could significantly improve management of patients about the phase trial the phase study was a three center randomized double blind inpatient study to evaluate the degree of subjective opioid blocking efficacy of cam q w in non treatment seeking participants with moderate to severe opioid use disorder after screening participants were randomized to different cam q w once weekly injections for two weeks during this period four challenge sessions were conducted with a randomized hydromorphone dose to determine subjective liking score based on a visual analogue scale additional information on the design of the trial can be found at www clinicaltrials gov about cam the investigational cam buprenorphine subcutaneous injection products for treatment of opioid use disorder are being developed as once weekly and once monthly formulations each with multiple doses to cover all phases of treatment from initiation through maintenance the cam products are designed for administration by healthcare personnel to ensure proper delivery that minimizes the risks of

marlborough mass april prnewswire hologic inc nasdaq holx announced that study results published today in a research letter in jama conclude that breast tomosynthesis hologic s genius d mammography exams reduce recall rates and increase invasive cancer detection in women with both dense and nondense breasts these key benefits of d mammography could lower the costs associated with needless follow up exams and improve patient experience for women seeking a more accurate screening mammogram density is only identifiable on a mammogram or other imaging system and is a reflection of how much fibrous or glandular tissue is in the breast higher breast density may increase a woman s chance of getting breast cancer make detection of cancer on conventional mammography more difficult and increase the chances that a woman will be recalled for additional imaging mammograms are categorized into four density groups almost entirely fat scattered fibroglandular densities heterogeneously dense and extremely dense the latter two groups are considered dense however the vast majority of women whose mammograms are considered dense have heterogeneously dense breast tissue density creates challenges for conventional mammography by obscuring the images which often results in additional visits and exams for women said edward evantash md board certified ob gyn and medical director for hologic this new analysis confirms that genius d mammography exams reduce unnecessary follow up exams in dense breasted women this has the potential to provide health systems and insurance companies with significant cost savings reduce patient stress and expenses and alleviate challenges for referring physicians who are tasked with relaying mammography results to their patients improvements in both recall rate reduction and invasive cancer detection were greatest for women with heterogeneously dense breasts with a percent increase in invasive cancer detection and a simultaneous percent reduction in recall rate women with heterogeneously dense breasts make up about percent of the u s screening population women ages approximately million women in the u s utilizing genius d mammography exams for breast cancer screening will reduce the need for subsequent unnecessary testing and decrease the number of unnecessary breast biopsies addressing concerns that were previously raised as limitations of conventional mammography while also reducing costs for health systems said pete valenti hologic s division president breast and skeletal health solutions twenty six states have passed legislation requiring doctors to notify women if they have dense breasts and now these women who were previously confused about how to proceed with breast cancer screening can feel confident turning to d mammography exams to reduce their chances of stressful recalls and help find more invasive cancer this study brought together the principal investigators from the groundbreaking study on d mammography exams also published in jama this time led by elizabeth rafferty md a co author on the prior study a total of examinations conventional mammograms compared to genius d mammography exams

websites aren t telling full story on tobacco product risks the evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources buffalo n y millions of people visit the websites of the mayo clinic american cancer society and the centers for disease control and prevention among others seeking authoritative health information but are they receiving it when it comes to learning about the differences in risk among certain types of nicotine products many government websites are actually misleading or under informing the public according to two researchers who analyzed the content of numerous health websites this information quarantine in turn helps explain the woeful lack of public knowledge about relative risks violating basic consumer rights as well as the public health principles of individual rights and health literacy the researchers say writing in the international journal of drug policy lynn kozlowski of the university at buffalo and david sweanor of the university of ottawa point out that many websites omit information showing that products such as e cigarettes smokeless tobacco and snus are far less harmful than traditional cigarettes public health ethics always has a concern to avoid any net harm to population health explains kozlowski professor of community health and health behavior at ub and the paper s lead author the fear has been that much safer tobacco and nicotine products like snus smokeless tobacco and vape will possibly cause a net loss to public health because more people will use these products and these products may lead to cigarette use this fear however is not based on actual evidence and cannot be used to suppress or otherwise keep the public uninformed of what is clearly known about the lower risks of these products adds kozlowski phd one of the world s leading researchers on smoking behavior an information quarantine functions similarly to a medical quarantine think of your favorite zombie movie or television show in which the infected person is secluded from everyone else to protect the overall public in order to justify a quarantine there has to be clear evidence that the need to protect population health should overrule personal autonomy in the case of providing information on differential health risks of nicotine products the evidence to date does not come close to establishing that there would be a loss to public health from making this information widely available from credible sources kozlowski says kozlowski and sweanor reviewed several major health websites including the cdc mayo clinic american cancer society substance abuse and mental health services administration and the national cancer institute and found three types of examples of information on smokeless tobacco but no to modest efforts to inform consumers of the significantly lower risks compared to cigarettes for lifelong users the researchers write in fact they found that the mayo clinic perpetuated a misrepresentation discovered in erroneously informing visitors that smokeless tobacco was as dangerous as cigarettes the day after the article was released the mayo clinic removed the headline replacing it with the still misleading statement that smokeless tobacco was not a safe product people can only make as good a decision as the information available to them allows said sweanor an adjunct professor in the university of ottawa s faculty of law who has spearheaded the development of world leading tobacco control initiatives in canada since the early s the public is dramatically misinformed about the relative risks of substitutable tobacco and nicotine products the risk differentials are huge but this is simply not known by a vast majority of those whose lives are at risk adds sweanor england has an example of a website action on smoking and health ash that gets it right on vaping the researchers said a briefing posted on the site specifically states compared to tobacco products electronic cigarettes are significantly safer in their paper the researchers note that information on comparative risks is common for other products and activities like over the counter medicines and even safety ratings of vehicles they argue that the u s food and drug administration fda which regulates the sale of tobacco products isn t doing its part to inform consumers of important differences in harm among tobacco products to illustrate their point kozlowski and sweanor use the example that if one type of alcoholic beverage caused in regular users to die prematurely as is the case with smoking traditional cigarettes while another caused massively fewer deaths consumers would want to know which product was the safer alternative it would be scandalous even criminal to keep such facts from consumers the researchers write yet such facts are being kept from adult consumers of legal tobacco nicotine products either by not informing or actively misinforming consumers it is as if tobacco consumers were blindfolded and not allowed to see dramatic differences in harm from different products,1
vancouver british columbia april prnewswire usnewswire mapping blood flow in the brain of athletes using an advanced form of ultrasound may make it easier to more accurately recognize concussions according to a study released today that will be presented at the american academy of neurology s th annual meeting in vancouver canada april to there is growing evidence that concussions can change the blood flow in the brain said study author robert hamilton phd co founder of neural analytics in los angeles calif and a member of the american academy of neurology while such changes may be detected with mri we believe there may be a less expensive and portable way to measure these changes with a transcranial doppler tcd device more than one million athletes experience a concussion each year in the united states tcd uses ultrasound to map blood flow activity in the brain traditionally it has measured variables like the speed and variability pulse of blood flowing through the arteries but those measurements haven t been enough to accurately detect concussion for this study researchers used an advanced version of tcd ultrasound to get a more complete picture of just how the blood moves through the middle cerebral artery one of the three major arteries in the brain researchers compared a group of high school athletes in contact sports who had been recently diagnosed with a concussion to a control group of high school student athletes from both contact and non contact sports examples of collision sports included in the study were football soccer basketball hockey water polo and lacrosse the non contact sports included were cheerleading cross country cycling tennis and track both the control and concussion groups were approximately percent female each of the concussed athletes had their brain blood flow measured with the advanced ultrasound headset within an average of six days after the injury they were also given a general concussion evaluation and had their blood pressure checked the study found that the advanced version of tcd ultrasound was able to differentiate between healthy and concussed athletes percent of the time this is in contrast to traditional tcd ultrasound measurements like change in cerebral blood flow reactivity which differentiated between the two percent of the time average blood flow speed which differentiated percent of the time and blood flow resistance which differentiated percent of the time this research suggests that this advanced form of ultrasound may provide a more accurate diagnosis of concussion said hamilton while more research is needed the hope is such a tool could one day be used on the sidelines to help determine more quickly whether an athlete needs further testing this important work provides insight into a tool that may yet prove useful in the recognition and management of concussion said jeffrey kutcher md faan with the the sports neurology clinic in brighton michigan the potential of having an accessible technology that detects a physiological change following brain trauma is very exciting however what these detected blood flow changes mean to a patient s clinical care is still unclear this is an important area of research testing of the tcd technique at the sideline at the time of injury will be an important next step to determine its ultimate utility said randolph s marshall md ms with columbia presbyterian medical center in new york and a member of the american academy of neurology s science committee the study was supported by the national institutes of health and the national science foundation learn more about concussion at www aan com concussion where you can access the aan s sports concussion guideline quickcheck app and other resources the american academy of neurology an association of neurologists and neuroscience professionals is dedicated to promoting the highest quality patient centered neurologic care a neurologist is a doctor with specialized training in diagnosing treating and managing disorders of the brain and nervous system such as alzheimer s disease stroke migraine multiple sclerosis brain injury parkinson s disease and epilepsy for more information about the american academy of neurology visit or find us on facebook twitter google and youtube source american academy of neurology related links,1

denver march prnewswire a new study gives depression sufferers much hope if only they can get their doctors to look at this study ketamine infusion therapy the controversial treatment for depression has been resisted by many physicians due to concerns about short lived benefits risks of addiction and the lack of large scale studies in contrast this retrospective study of over three years of clinical experience shows lasting benefits for many patients with no apparent risk of addiction through a handful of ketamine infusions directed by theodore henderson md phd refractory depression symptoms can be relieved significantly and persistently evidence points to the regeneration of brain cells as a critical mechanism for the relief of depression as published in peer reviewed journal neural regeneration research february issue photo the study practical application of the neuroregenerative properties of ketamine real world treatment experience addresses key points in the controversy surrounding the use of intravenous ketamine for the treatment of depression its findings stand in direct contrast to warnings from the american psychiatric association apa while controversial in academic settings dr henderson said his direct experience supports a different strategy for multiple infusion treatment regimens and his clinical experience shows ketamine can invoke long lasting effects often with less than six infusions the wealth of clinical experience from treating hundreds of patients with ketamine has supplanted the preliminary data that emerged from the initial open label and small double blinded studies said dr henderson who is a board certified psychiatrist specializing in diagnosing and treating complex conditions based in denver colorado he is also the co founder of neuro luminance ketamine infusion centers patients in the study completed the quick inventory of depressive symptoms qids sr among other scales and showed persistent positive response to the ketamine infusions treatments what is a ketamine infusion ketamine is a dissociative anesthetic in use since s intravenous administration over a prolonged period of time is key to its persistent antidepressant benefit depression is associated with neuron loss reduced synapse numbers and dearborization of dendrites ketamine appears to potently induce mechanisms which reverse these neuro degenerative processes citing over published scientific research studies the new research article also reviews the molecular mechanisms by which ketamine invokes a robust activation of the brain s own repair mechanisms another conclusion dr henderson highlights is ketamine infusions can relieve refractory depression symptoms persistently perhaps for years activation of brain derived neurotrophic factor bdnf appears to have an important role in the antidepressant effects of ketamine bdnf induces synaptogenesis dendritic arborization improved neuronal health and neurogenesis these processes likely underlie the persistent benefits of ketamine dr henderson s findings challenge the oft held beliefs that ketamine must be given frequently to have any benefit and that ketamine has no long lasting benefit dr henderson stated misconceptions about ketamine abound among psychiatrists particularly related to possible chemical dependence problems however the neurobiological basis of its benefit for depression has nothing to do with causing addictive risk our patients get better after a few infusions and from there treatments can be discontinued the study also challenges concerns about neurotoxicity and a recent hypothesis that patients must experience hallucinations during ketamine infusion in order to have an anti depressant benefit please visit neuro luminance or call for more information media contact david jahr source neuro luminance,1
athens greece march prnewswire topline results of the first randomised clinical trial in the world to investigate the effects of a nutritional intervention in very early ad pre dementia topline results from the european lipididiet clinical trial were presented today as part of a late breaking presentation at the advances in alzheimer s therapy aat congress they showed that in people with very early ad pre dementia a once daily nutritional drink designated a food for special medical purposes can help to reduce brain shrinkage particularly in the hippocampal brain area the part of the brain that helps store short term memories for long term retrieval and for those who start the intervention early and consumed it regularly it can help to conserve memory and the ability to think and perform everyday tasks the drink contains fortasyn connect a specific combination of fatty acids vitamins and other nutrients this is the first time a randomised double blind clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early ad pre dementia to carry out everyday tasks such as paying bills or finding your way around as measured by the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes cdr sb a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks this is important because those with very early ad pre dementia currently have no approved available pharmacological options the study did not find a significant benefit in broad cognitive function the study primary endpoint cognitive decline over the study period was less than originally expected when it was designed ten years ago so differences found between the two groups were too small to be statistically significant project coordinator professor tobias hartmann saarland university germany explained that this is the most likely reason the primary endpoint was not met professor hilkka soininen professor in neurology md phd from the university of eastern finland who headed the clinical trial as part of the lipididiet project said today s results are extremely valuable as they bring us closer to understanding the impact of nutritional interventions on very early ad pre dementia which we are now better at diagnosing but unable to treat due to a lack of approved pharmaceutical options the lipididiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients ability to perform everyday tasks possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease we look forward to the results of subsequent analyses and the six year extension study which will provide further insights the clinical trial headed by professor hilkka soininen is part of a large ec project lipididiet to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing ad and vascular dementia lipididiet is funded by the seventh framework programme fp of the european commission ec and coordinated by professor hartmann saarland university in germany fortasyn connect was selected by a consortium of leading researchers from european institutes for this month randomised controlled double blind multicentre study involving patients on the basis of its results in a previous eu project lipidiet nearly million people have alzheimer s or a related dementia for which there is currently no cure this number is expected to double every years reaching million in and million in study details the trial was the first to investigate the impact of fortasyn connect on patients with very early ad pre dementia who were randomised to receive either fortasyn connect or an iso caloric control drink once daily the primary outcome parameter was selected to assess the effect on cognitive function a broad measure of thinking during months intake of fortasyn connect compared with a control product this was a cognitive composite score consisting of the cerad word immediate recall delayed recall and recognition category fluency and letter digit substitution test secondary outcome parameters were brain volumes total hippocampal whole brain ventricular volumes the clinical dementia rating sum of boxes cdr sb neuropsychological test battery composite scores episodic memory executive function working memory composite and a complete composite score consisting of subtests progression to ad dementia blood and csf biomarkers tolerance and safety no significant difference was observed for the cognitive composite score predefined analyses showed significant differences between active and control study groups for hippocampal and whole brain atrophy and favourable effects for cdr sum of boxes and episodic memory both were most pronounced in patients with high baseline cognition with regular intake analyses are ongoing for progression to ad dementia and blood and csf biomarkers tobias hartmann the project s coordinator said we have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia indeed certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain however translating this into an effective intervention hasn t been easy because single nutrients simply aren t powerful enough to fight a disease like alzheimer s alone today s clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients in order to increase their effect this is exciting because it shows that in the absence of effective drug options we really have found something that can help slow down some of the most distressing symptoms in very early ad pre dementia especially in those who started the intervention early indeed those patients who have lost the least cognitive function have the most to gain notes to editors about lipididiet lipididiet is

newswise dallas feb a year old heart patient with dangerously high levels of cholesterol that could not be adequately reduced by statin drugs now has near normal cholesterol levels thanks to a new class of drugs that grew out of work done by ut southwestern medical center researchers two of these drugs in a category known as pcsk inhibitors were approved by the food and drug administration last summer for use by some individuals with extremely high cholesterol levels if you take the core patients who are at highest risk it makes you appreciate how important this drug class is said dr amit khera director of the preventive cardiology program and associate professor of internal medicine at ut southwestern frank brown of dallas grandfather of six and the owner of frank s wrecker service in dallas has familial hypercholesterolemia an inherited condition that causes high levels of cholesterol especially low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol or bad cholesterol high levels of ldl cholesterol are strongly associated with heart disease mr brown with a history of two heart attacks had been aggressively treated with multiple drugs to reduce his cholesterol levels but they remained stubbornly high when i first met mr brown he had a strong family history of heart disease he had a cholesterol level that was ridiculously high with an ldl of and he was having chest pains said dr amit khera who is mr brown s cardiologist dr khera who holds the dallas heart ball chair in hypertension and heart disease at ut southwestern was treating mr brown with three cholesterol lowering medications a statin which is a class of drugs that works by blocking a substance the body needs to make cholesterol ezetimibe a drug that blocks absorption of cholesterol in the intestine and colesevelam which sequesters bile acids even with this trio of medicines mr brown s ldl cholesterol level hovered around the two pcsk inhibitors approved by the fda last year were developed as a result of research done by ut southwestern geneticists dr helen hobbs and dr jonathan cohen using data from the dallas heart study a population based study that gathered extensive medical data on dallas residents the two researchers showed that certain mutations to the gene that codes for the protein pcsk lead to low levels of cholesterol in the blood further dr hobbs and dr cohen found a woman who had inherited not one but two of these mutations in the pcsk gene one mutation from each parent this woman had stunningly low levels of ldl cholesterol while anything below is considered good her ldl cholesterol level was just crucially this woman was in good health suggesting that therapies aimed at blocking pcsk would not only be effective but also safe their research led to the development by drug companies of evolocumab and alirocumab the two approved pcsk inhibitors which are delivered by monthly or semimonthly injections dr hobbs director of the eugene mcdermott center for human growth and development holds the eugene mcdermott distinguished chair for the study of human growth and development the philip o bryan montgomery jr m d distinguished chair in developmental biology and the dallas heart ball chair in cardiology research dr cohen professor of internal medicine and with the mcdermott center holds the c vincent prothro distinguished chair in human nutrition research mr brown had been part of a clinical trial testing the safety and effectiveness of one of the new pcsk inhibitors and when the drugs were approved dr khera began working to get mr brown approved by his insurance to be on the new regimen in the world of cholesterol patients most are well controlled with statins and they should stay on those said dr khera but mr brown is the perfect patient for pcsk inhibitors we knew he could tolerate it because he d been in a clinical trial he knew how to administer the injections and he was very high risk we d exhausted the other options in trying to control his cholesterol two months after he started his biweekly injections of the new drug mr brown s ldl cholesterol level was down to not quite normal which is or less but an almost percent reduction from the level it had been for years it s a good sign for mr brown who looks forward to many more years of running his business watching dallas cowboys games and spending time with his grandchildren there are many more frank browns out there patients who can t control their cholesterol with the standard drugs said dr khera it s wonderful to have this option to offer this special

newswise omega fatty acids may lower the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal obese women according to researchers the protection likely comes from the fatty acids anti inflammatory effects said dr andrea manni professor and division chief of endocrinology diabetes and metabolism penn state college of medicine obesity is a major breast cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women and scientists believe increased inflammation is an important underlying cause in this population omega fatty acids have an anti inflammatory effect so that s one of the reasons why we suspected it may be particularly effective in obese women manni said some epidemiological data supports the idea that omega s protect against breast cancer but the findings have been inconsistent manni suspected that data from normal weight women obscured the results normal weight women have less inflammation than heavier women and are therefore less likely to benefit from anti inflammatory omega s he said to tease apart the effects manni s team working alongside researchers from emory university and colorado state university looked at the influence of prescription omega supplementation on breast density in different weight women breast density is a well established biomarker for breast cancer risk and may be an independent risk factor as well the higher the breast density the more likely the woman will develop breast cancer manni said the study included healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms the women either received no treatment the antiestrogen drug raloxifene the prescription omega drug lovaza or a combination of the two drugs at the conclusion of the two year study the researchers found that increasing levels of omega in the blood were associated with reduced breast density but only in women with a body mass index above bordering on obesity although lovaza contains both of the fatty acids dha milligrams and epa milligrams only dha blood levels were associated with breast density reduction the researchers plan to test the effect of dha alone in obese subjects potentially in combination with weight loss in a future trial the finding supports the idea that omega s and specifically dha are preferentially protective in obese postmenopausal women manni said this represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention these findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women manni added that with obesity related cancers on the rise the findings could have implications beyond breast cancer the researchers also made a secondary discovery lovaza is an omega drug fda approved for the treatment of severe high triglycerides at the dose of milligrams daily in the current study the combination of lovaza and a half recommended dose of raloxifene at milligrams was superior to the individual treatments in reducing triglycerides and ldl bad cholesterol and increasing hdl good cholesterol other investigators on this project were narinder sandhu and carina signori department of medicine susann e schetter department of radiology jason liao and ana calcagnotto department of public health sciences john p richie bogdan prokopczyk and neil trushin department of pharmacology cynthia dubrock penn state hershey cancer institute christopher hamilton and laurence m demers department of pathology cesar aliaga and karam el bayoumy department of biochemistry and molecular biology all at penn state milton s hershey medical center terryl j hartman emory university and john mcginley and henry j thompson colorado state university susan g komen for the cure and penn state hershey cancer institute funded this research glaxosmith kline and eli lilly supplied lovaza and raloxifene respectively about penn state college of medicinelocated on the campus of penn state milton s hershey medical center in hershey pa penn state college of medicine boasts a portfolio of nearly million in funded research projects range from the development of artificial organs and advanced diagnostics to groundbreaking cancer treatments and understanding the fundamental causes of disease enrolling its first students in the college of medicine has more than students and trainees in medicine nursing the health professions and biomedical research on its campus,1
newswise hamilton jan a multi disciplinary team of researchers has developed a new diagnostic test that can change the medical landscape by making it possible for patients to quickly determine if they are infected with an illness using a simple paper test sensitive enough to detect markers of various illnesses using minute amounts of blood sweat or other biological material the test developed by biochemists engineers and chemists at mcmaster university features an all inclusive patch of reactive material or reagent printed on paper that changes colour to indicate the presence of a biological marker for a specific bacterium virus or even cancer it s a very simple device that anyone can use says yingfu li a professor of biochemistry and biomedical sciences at mcmaster and one of the authors of a new paper in the german chemistry journal angewandte chemie there s a huge need for this type of technology li explains that the platform can be manufactured cheaply and easily formulated to detect biological markers for a huge range of illnesses only a tiny sample of blood sweat or other fluid is required since the test works by detecting and amplifying the target dna or rna sequence in a sample a single molecule of the target can be multiplied thousands of times producing a visible result conceivably a user could swab a doorknob or dip it in a toilet bowl to test for ebola for example the test is the latest in a series of related developments to emerge from the biointerfaces institute whose mission is to create useful new substances that combine biological agents and physical materials the new test involves printing of all required components needed to amplify a dna or rna target directly on paper says the institute s director john brennan the user only needs to add the sample to the paper and wait a few minutes for a color to develop the test material is suspended in pullulan a naturally derived polymeric sugar that is also the platform for the familiar listerine breath strips pullulan allows the testing materials to remain viable for months until used the new test which could be commercialized quickly the researchers say can diagnose infections even before patients feel symptoms during cold season for example patients could save trips to the doctor and exposing the public by testing themselves at home the test can also quickly differentiate between illnesses that share similar symptoms such as headache fever or diarrhea permitting a quick diagnosis and earlier treatment because it is portable inexpensive and requires no other equipment the technology which can be printed on paper by an inkjet printer could be used in many environments such as homes and airports and in remote locations research funding was provided by the natural sciences and engineering research council of canada ontario centres of excellence and pro lab diagnostics inc see original study,1

share fast facts ct scans outperform stress tests in spotting clogged arteries click to tweet ct angiograms detect blockages in nine out of people click to tweet tests can miss four out of patients with clogged heart vessels click to tweet results of a head to head comparison study led by johns hopkins researchers show that noninvasive ct scans of the heart s vessels are far better at spotting clogged arteries that can trigger a heart attack than the commonly prescribed exercise stress that most patients with chest pain undergo a report on the findings comparing ct angiograms and stress tests published online oct in the journal circulation cardiovascular imaging show the scans correctly identified blockages in nine out of people while stress tests picked up blockages in six out of what renders the results of the new study particularly powerful researchers say is that each patient underwent all three tests for providing a direct head to head comparison of their ability to accurately spot blockages no tests is percent accurate percent of the time but our findings indicate ct angiograms get pretty close to that coveted threshold says lead investigator armin zadeh m d ph d associate professor of medicine at the johns hopkins university school of medicine we hope our findings will settle any residual uncertainty about the effectiveness of these two common noninvasive heart tests the researchers note that the gold standard for detecting blocked arteries remains invasive cardiac angiography a test using dye and x rays that requires a catheter to be threaded into the heart s vessels but cardiologists have long relied on so called stress testing as a simpler cheaper gatekeeper procedure to identify people more likely to benefit from the riskier more invasive and more costly catheterizations ct angiograms have recently emerged as yet another non invasive alternative a handful of studies zadeh says have suggested ct angiographies may be superior but uncertainty has persisted due the small number of people involved in these analyses and stress tests have remained the more popular choice among clinicians results of the new study the research team says should help settle lingering doubts among physicians and the nearly million americans who seek medical attention each year for symptoms that signal a clogged artery including chest pain shortness of breath and extreme fatigue in ct angiography clinicians use dye injected into the circulation to visualize blockages inside the arteries when the dye reaches impenetrable or narrowed passages clogged by fatty buildups or clots the scan shows a blockage the so called nuclear exercise stress tests also use dye and ct scans but instead of directly visualizing the interior of the arteries they measure blood flow to the heart muscle immediately after a patient walks on a treadmill reduced blood flow to the heart muscle is a signal that a narrowed or blocked artery is not supplying the muscle with enough blood although exercise stress testing is generally safe for most people it can rarely trigger an abnormal heart rhythm or even an actual heart attack in people with seriously clogged arteries researchers emphasize that both nuclear stress tests and ct angiograms expose patients to radiation while many newer ct scans deliver substantially lower doses of radiation than the scans used in nuclear stress tests the dose and protocols can vary widely from hospital to hospital researchers say ct angiograms and nuclear stress tests carry similar price tags between and researchers say the total tab stemming from either test including downstream costs related to additional testing due to unclear or unrelated findings remains unclear and should be an important consideration in crafting any new testing recommendations for the current study patients ages to seen at hospitals in eight countries underwent noninvasive ct angiograms followed by traditional catheter based coronary angiographies within two months each patient also underwent an exercise stress test all patients had symptoms suggestive of heart disease but not all had a previous diagnosis of the condition overall non invasive ct angiograms accurately detected or ruled out artery blockages in percent of patients compared with percent for stress testing when researchers analyzed test performance in a subgroup of patients with very high risk disease as identified on traditional angiography the diagnostic accuracy of ct angiograms went up to percent compared with percent for stress testing in other words researchers report stress tests missed two out of every patients with severe disease marked by multiple blockages current guidelines from the american heart association and the american college cardiology call for a stress tests in all patients who show signs of coronary artery disease to confirm the diagnosis and define the severity of the blockage ct angiograms are generally reserved only

researchers analyzed men with prostate cancer among the group of participants tumor benign and germline samples were looked at the researchers analyzed the samples and looked for genetic differences that made it so the researchers could categorize the study participants into groups regarding targeted treatments specific to their prostate cancer what they found was more than minimal differences among the tumors they concluded that five different types of prostate cancer were found based on genes these genes demonstrated the risk of the disease progression which was more accurate than the currently used gleason score test and psa test prior research had shown six of the genes were linked to prostate cancer however researchers noted in the published study that it turns out the other genes had not been associated with prostate cancer until now if five types of the disease exist how does this change popular medical opinion on prostate cancer screening this may mean that each type of the disease needs its own approach to screening diagnosis treatment and even recurrence noted dr samadi while the findings need further research larger clinical trials could give better information on individualized treatment for each prostate cancer type this could lead to a better quality of life and more effective treatment based on which prostate cancer a man is diagnosed with prostate cancer key statistics prostate cancer is one of the leading causes of death among men other than skin cancer prostate cancer is the most common cancer in american men about in men will get prostate cancer in their lifetime prostate cancer mainly occurs in older men about in cases are diagnosed in men aged or older it is much rarer for men younger than years old to develop prostate cancer the average age of diagnosis is about years old in it is estimated that there will be more than deaths from prostate cancer the researchers said the analysis in their study is better at forecasting how prostate cancer will advance compared to the current diagnostic tests being used for prostate cancer such as the prostate specific antigen test and the gleason score these findings could lead to more optimized diagnostic testing on all aspects of the prostate cancer diagnosis process and brings full circle the coming approach to cancer being an individual disease based very much on the patient s individual genetic profile said dr samadi get more of dr samadi s take on this study and its effect on the field of prostate cancer on fox news sunday housecall patients newly diagnosed with prostate cancer can contact world renowned prostate cancer surgeon and urologic oncologist dr david samadi for a consultation or second opinion for men with a family history of the disease contact dr samadi to learn more about your risk factors and to get a baseline psa blood test visit prostatecancer com and call to set up your consultation photo source dr david samadi related links,0
tell tale biomarker detects early breast cancer in nih funded study mri can detect the earliest signs of breast cancer recurrence and fast growing tumors researchers have shown that magnetic resonance imaging mri can detect the earliest signs of breast cancer recurrence and fast growing tumors their approach detects micrometastases breakaway tumor cells with the potential to develop into dangerous secondary breast cancer tumors elsewhere in the body the approach may offer an improved way to detect early recurrence of breast cancer in women and men the work was completed at case western reserve university cwru cleveland and was funded by the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering nibib part of the national institutes of health mri has a wide array of diagnostic applications and shows promise in breast cancer detection and treatment monitoring said richard conroy ph d director of nibib division of applied science and technology the technique used by researchers in this study enables very early detection of metastatic spread which would allow adaptation of treatment more quickly and hopefully lead to better outcomes in the future the study published online in the aug issue of nature communications was led by zheng rong lu ph d cwru m frank rudy and margaret domiter rudy professor of biomedical engineering and an expert in molecular imaging for cancer and other diseases we showed with this technique that we can detect very tiny tumors of just a few hundred cells lu said adding that the study pushed imaging boundaries revealing smaller cancers than can be detected with current clinical imaging modalities our imaging technology has the potential to differentiate aggressive tumors from low risk tumors these are two things that potentially can make a big impact on clinical practice and also management of cancer one third of patients diagnosed with breast cancer eventually develop metastases in distant organs with an increased risk of death breast cancer has a high rate of metastasis to bone lung liver lymph nodes and the brain since small early stage cancers are the most responsive to drug treatments screening is an important aspect of follow up care for breast cancer patients and early detection is critical in tailoring appropriate and effective therapeutic interventions while multiple imaging techniques including mri are currently used in breast cancer detection and clinical management they are neither able to detect specific cancer types or early cancer growth the earliest signs of cancer spread are called micrometastases as the name implies they are often too small to be detected with standard screening dr lu s team used a biochemical approach combined with mri to detect molecular changes that signal micrometastases to detect micrometastases lu and his team used mri imaging which uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images and combined it with a special chemical contrast solution the contrast solution that the team developed contains a short piece of protein or peptide tagged with a minuscule magnet they chose the peptide a chain of just five amino acids for its inclination to bind to protein matrix structures around cancer cells called fibrin fibronectin complexes more importantly the fibronectin part of the complex is expressed during a cell s transition to cancer and plays a role in cell growth migration and differentiation fibronectin is associated with high risk breast cancer with poor prognosis the researchers collected images depicting metastases where breast cancer had spread beyond the original tumors metal molecules within the contrast solution are magnetized during the mri process and enhance the image wherever the molecules of solution bind with the targeted protein the primary tumor sends signals to distant tissue and organs to prepare the soil for metastasis lu said by also binding with the magnetically tagged peptide the biomarker is enhanced generating enough signal for mri detection of small high risk cancer and micrometastases the researchers tested the approach in mice into which they had introduced breast cancer cells after a two week waiting period the researchers injected the contrast solution and performed mri the mri imaging detected metastatic tumors including micrometastases in lung liver lymph node adrenal gland bone and brains of the mice analysis of images showed that the contrast used by the research team bound almost exclusively to the fibrin fibronectin complexes producing a strong and prolonged image enhancement of micrometastases and tumors compared with normal tissue using a microscopic imaging approach called cryo imaging and mri the researchers verified that the mri technique could detect micrometastases even observing bone micrometastases that were less than mm the diameter of a very fine pencil lead prior to their study with this contrast agent lu s team had conducted studies to determine its clearance from the body after the imaging which is essential for safe clinical use their testing showed that the agent is readily cleared from the body and has a low level of retention in tissues therefore they expect it will be safe if ultimately developed for clinical use the recurrence rates of some forms of breast cancer and the consequence of metastatic cancer make these efforts urgent and important said lu adding that his research team also hopes to advance the approach for prostate cancer detection we think this targeted approach holds great promise for earlier imaging of high risk cancers in the clinic it could also become useful as a non invasive way to assess breast cancer treatment progress the team plans to complete safety testing of the imaging agent during the next three years they will then pursue human trials with this approach this work was supported in part by nih grants eb about the national institute of biomedical imaging and

scientists have found an unexpected use for virtual reality headsets to help pinpoint people who may later develop alzheimer s disease the devices widely used by computer gamers display images that can be used to test the navigational skills of people thought to be at risk of dementia those who do worse in the tests will be the ones most likely to succumb to alzheimer s later in life scientists now believe by identifying potential patients far earlier than is possible at present researchers hope it should then become easier in the long term to develop treatments aimed at halting or slowing their condition it is usually thought memory is the first attribute affected in alzheimer s said project leader dennis chan a neuroscientist based at cambridge university but difficulty with navigation is increasingly recognised as one of the very earliest symptoms this may predate the onset of other symptoms by pinpointing those who are beginning to lose their navigational skills we hope to show that we can target people at a much earlier stage of the condition and one day become far more effective in treating them the discovery that loss of navigational skills was associated with alzheimer s disease was made several years ago by chan and colleagues based at several centres in the uk these studies used tablet computers to test navigational tasks but now scientists plan to take their tests to a new level with the use of the virtual reality sets in which wearers are immersed in simulated environments through which they must navigate around people aged between and will be recruited to take part in the study some will have a gene that puts them at risk of the condition or will come from a family with a history of alzheimer s not all will be destined to be affected by the disease however chan s project aims to find out who will wearing virtual reality headsets participants will be asked to navigate their way towards and then remember details of a series of different environments we will make a note of those who have particular problems and see if these are the ones who are at higher risk of developing alzheimer s explained chan the aim of the study is very simple can we detect changes in brain function before people are aware that they have them researchers recently pinpointed the significance of a tiny area of the brain known as the entorhinal cortex which acts as a hub in a widespread brain network that controls navigation this now appears to be the first part of the brain that succumbs to alzheimer s the entorhinal cortex is the first brain region to show degeneration when you get alzheimer s and that is where we shall be focusing our research said chan whose work is funded by the alzheimer s society the goal of the work is to help people as they develop the disease to date drug trials for alzheimer s have been applied when people have already got dementia by which time considerable damage to the brain has already occurred chan told the observer if we can develop drugs and administer them earlier for instance before the disease has spread beyond the entorhinal cortex then this would have the potential to prevent the onset of dementia,0
a chicago couple who previously suffered two miscarriages recently welcomed a healthy baby boy thanks to a breakthrough new fertility test which helps women struggling with achieving a successful pregnancy by examining the mother s dna the test is offering new hope to many family s struggling to conceive carolyn bilson and tim o brien met three years ago and say it was love at first sight literally a month later we knew we wanted to have children bilson told good morning america abc news but after two miscarriages bilson then pushing said the couple sought help from a fertility specialist in chicago who recommended in vitro fertilization their first attempt at ivf however failed too according to bilson i think it was just so devastating because we didn t anticipate that she said we thought the hard part would be getting pregnant not staying pregnant o brien added that the most frustrating thing was that you didn t learn anything from the previous miscarriage so there wasn t what could we do differently the couple then learned about a new way to tailor fertility treatments specifically to the dna of the mother using a test that can help couples figure out the perfect time for conception based on that dna abcnews com the endometrial receptivity test uses a tissue sample to look at genes to find out the optimum time for conception thus increasing the couple s chance to conceive for bilson that time is two days later than the average woman dr ilan tur kaspa an ob gyn and the director of chicago s institute for human reproduction described the process as personalized medicine abc news this is what we are trying to do here by personalized medicine tur kaspa said adding that you can make sure that the uterus is ready and optimize a time for implantation the result their beautiful baby westley who is now nine months old we re so lucky bilson said we re so blessed abc news ob gyn dr jessica shepherd told gma that this breakthrough new treatment is very exciting to the medical community because it offers another avenue for women who have recurrent miscarriages to potentially get pregnant when it is something they never thought they could look forward to the new technique works by having a doctor take a sample of the women s endometrial tissue which you can get dna from and from that dna you can tell what part of the cycle is prime time to take the fertilized egg and implant it via ivf shepherd added shepherd said that the ideal candidates are women who have had three or more miscarriages or women over but emphasized that the test is not for everyone and infertility is a spectrum one risk of the procedure many women may not take into account is the emotional effects of it not working and you still miscarrying shepherd said it is a new process and important to go over the risks of the procedure which can vary per person with your health care provider,1

en español by alan mozes healthday reporter tuesday nov healthday news what if a simple zap to the spine could relieve the debilitating lower back and leg pain brought on by a herniated disk such is the promise of pulse radiofrequency therapy prf which sends inflammation reducing pulses of energy to nerve roots in the spine a new study claims the therapy is not new having first received u s food and drug administration approval in the s but recent advances in ct scan technology now enable clinicians to deploy those energy pulses with much more accuracy experts said and the new research suggests the treatment could prove a boon to back pain patients for whom standard therapies have failed to do the trick i was amazed with the results of prf said study author dr alessandro napoli especially having read as a radiologist numerous lumbar mri scans of patients with recurrent hernia after surgery and as a patient himself napoli added that from personal experience i can tell you that the treatment is not painful and the results are appreciated within days after a single treatment lasting minutes napoli is a professor of interventional radiology at sapienza university of rome in italy he and his colleagues plan to report their findings tuesday at the radiological society of north america annual meeting in chicago such research is considered preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal lower disk herniation results when the insulating disks that sit between spinal vertebrae tear open allowing jelly like material to protrude and exert pressure on surrounding nerve roots beyond lower back pain the condition often triggers sciatica a pain that radiates down a patient s leg standard therapies include over the counter pain meds corticosteroid spinal injections and or invasive spine surgery that sometimes involves disk removal and vertebrae fusion the problem said napoli is that such options entail risks without assured relief steroid injections are effective only in portion of the patients and generally require more sessions he noted and though surgery safety has largely improved napoli pointed to the risk for bleeding and infection the need for a minimum two to three day hospital stay the high cost and the fact that some patients ultimately realize little benefit by contrast prf is scalpel free delivering radio signals directly to affected nerves via a ct scan guided electrode the process said napoli requires no hospital stay is noninvasive far cheaper and less risky the rationale for using prf on disk herniation is that we eliminate the inflammation process of the compromised nerve root he explained without inflammation the pain fades and the body starts a self healing process that allows for complete resolution of the disk herniation in a large proportion of patients for the study the italian investigators compared lumbar herniation patients who underwent a single minute round of ct guided prf with patients who received one to three rounds of steroid injections all the patients had already undergone standard interventions with poor results by the one year mark following either treatment a full perceived recovery was reported by percent of the prf patients compared with just percent of the steroid injection patients dr daniel park director of minimally invasive orthopedic spine surgery at william beaumont hospital in royal oak mich offered some caution on the findings he noted that because the majority of people with back pain improve with time and exercise alone it remains an open question as to whether the prf procedure really cured the condition still park noted that diagnostic uncertainty can undermine the ability of surgery to get at the true source of a patient s pain given that the problem with low back pain is that there are many causes of it and physicians have trouble identifying the cause of pain nevertheless he remains unsure if prf is truly ready for prime time best case i think prf could be an option for people if they have already failed therapy and medication said park it may be a similar option for people if they do not or cannot have steroid injections but they need more treatment i think this is experimental and should not be first line more information the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons offers more information on herniated disks,1

scientists are inching closer to a drug that may protect peanut allergy sufferers from potentially life threatening complications that can occur due to accidental consumption while the drug is not being hailed as a cure for peanut allergy it has proven successful in building up patients tolerance to peanuts over time lessening the potential for life threatening complications we re excited about the potential to help children and adolescents with peanut allergy protect themselves against accidentally eating a food with peanut in it said allergist stephen tilles md acaai former president study co author and consulting advisor for aimmune therapeutics according to eurekalert our hope when we started the study was that by treating patients with the equivalent of one peanut per day many would tolerate as much as two peanuts we were pleased to find that two thirds of people in the study were able to tolerate the equivalent of two peanuts per day after nine to months of treatment and half the patients tolerated the equivalent of four peanuts fda warns against honey pacifiers after texas infants hospitalized with rare illness the results which were presented sunday at the college of allergy asthma and immunology annual scientific meeting and published in the new england journal of medicine were based on study participants ranging in age from to years old all participants who mostly fell between ages and had a peanut allergy but one third received a placebo while the rest were given a peanut protein powder that increased in dose over time participants ingested the peanut protein under the supervision of a board certified allergist as part of a process called an oral food challenge ofc reactions from the oral challenges at the end of the study were much milder than prior to treatment tilles said according to eurekalert on average the participants were able to tolerate a fold higher dose of peanut at the end of the study than they did at the beginning in addition the symptoms caused by the fold higher dose at the end of the study were milder than the symptoms on the lower dose at the beginning of the study experts children at risk of lead poisoning in chattanooga with fda approval this drug would mark the first treatment available by prescription for peanut allergies the study s authors noted that patients would need to stay on the drug in order to receive protection against the allergy this is not a quick fix and it doesn t mean people with peanut allergy will be able to eat peanuts whenever they want jay lieberman md vice chair of the acaai food allergy committee and study co author said according to eurekalert but it is definitely a breakthrough the hope would be to have a treatment available in the second half of if that happens people who receive and are able to tolerate this treatment should be protected from accidental exposures,1

cnn a five minute neck scan could predict a person s risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge researchers have said the test which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline according to the study by scientists at university college london ucl who presented their work sunday at the american heart association s annual scientific conference a group of almost patients aged had ultrasounds on their necks in before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to years from to people with the most intense pulses which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow were up to more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions the research found because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brain s network of blood vessels pulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use and can no longer cushion the blood flow coming from the heart if you can detect the risk in people in mid life it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle said dr scott chiesa post doctoral researcher at ucl what s good for the arteries is good for the brain he added in summary of his findings dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging how you live your life has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline if the findings are confirmed by larger studies they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age and the scans would be well set up for routine testing according to chiesa it s very easy to do and it s very quick to do when healthy arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain but damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells over time the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study what we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia said carol routledge director of research at alzheimer s research uk who was not involved in the research vascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain and this can also play a role in the development of alzheimer s disease studies have found those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia dementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function alzheimer s disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases around million people suffer from dementia worldwide according to the world health organization with numbers projected to rise to million by in the united states the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults according to the us centers for disease control and prevention while in the uk it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death according to the office for national statistics promising findings the study s findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people so it s promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development said paul edwards director of clinical services at dementia uk but he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis saying the elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia there is currently no cure for dementia though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms often a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information no follow up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next previous studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level but its effects remain largely incurable more research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia while these findings are interesting as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be said routledge routledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking only consuming alcohol within recommended limits staying active monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain,1
artificial intelligence can be used to spot alzheimer s six years before a patient would normally be diagnosed a study shows doctors used the self learning computer to detect changes in brain scans too subtle for humans to see the system was able to identify dementia in patients an average of six years before they were formally diagnosed british ai expert prof noel sharkey from the university of sheffield said of the findings this is exactly the sort of task that deep learning is cut out for finding high level patterns in data although the sample sizes and test sets were relatively small the results are so promising that a much larger study would be worthwhile boffins from the university of california trained the computer using more than scans from patients the scans measure brain activity by tracking the uptake of a radioactive liquid injected into the blood research has linked the development of alzheimer s to particular changes in certain brain regions but these can be difficult to spot the alzheimer s algorithm was able to teach itself to recognize patterns in brain scans that indicated disease as a final test it was given a set of scans from patients it had never studied before it proved to be percent accurate at detecting alzheimer s disease many years before the patient was later diagnosed dr jae ho sohn who worked on the project said we were very pleased with the algorithm s performance it was able to predict every single case that advanced to alzheimer s disease early detection of alzheimer s could open the door to new ways of slowing down or even halting the progression of the disease dr carol routledge from alzheimer s research uk said the diseases that cause dementia begin in the brain up to years before any symptoms start to show presenting a vital window of opportunity for us to intervene before widespread damage occurs this study highlights the potential of machine learning to assist with the early detection of diseases like alzheimer s but the findings will need to be confirmed in much larger groups of people before we can properly assess the power of this approach the research is published in the latest issue of the journal radiology click for more from the sun,1

en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter tuesday oct healthday news stimulating a specific set of nerves that are nestled along the spine may deliver relief to those who suffer from chronic back pain and cut the need for opioid painkillers new research suggests the therapy which targets the root ganglion nerves is more effective than other spine stimulation procedures because it places tiny leads precisely at the area where pain originates unlike other devices that provide more generalized stimulation the researchers said in certain patients who have not gotten relief from other treatments this therapy may give sustained pain relief and may allow them to reduce opioids for at least months and perhaps longer said lead researcher robert mccarthy he s a professor of anesthesiology at rush university medical center in chicago the dorsal root ganglions are nerve cells on both sides of each of the spine s vertebra and are the gateway to pain between nerves in different parts of the body spinal cord and brain stimulating this area interrupts pain signals between the painful area and the brain the researchers explained a pacemaker like device implanted under the skin in the lower back sends small electronic pulses through a wire placed near the specific dorsal root ganglion associated with the pain mccarthy said the pulses replace pain with tingling or numbness the strength of stimulation programmed by a doctor is based on the patient s level of pain he said the treatment has two advantages over spinal cord stimulation mccarthy said in spinal cord stimulation a wire runs along the spinal cord sending pulses along the entire spine but the pulses don t target the specific pain source in addition dorsal root ganglion stimulation requires significantly lower levels of electric current to quell pain mccarthy said the goal of this study he said was to judge the effectiveness of the therapy over a long period mccarthy and his colleagues implanted the device in people suffering with chronic back pain and followed them for three to months among the participants had the device for over a year before receiving the device most patients rated their pain as an on a scale of one to with being the worst for most patients the device reduced pain by percent which was significant the researchers reported in addition patients said they experienced a percent reduction in disability or limitations on daily activities caused by pain in all percent of the participants said the treatment was beneficial the procedure was not without complications five patients needed to have the wires implanted again two patients had them removed because they were infected and one had the device removed because of a complication mccarthy said the therapy is not widely available even though it was approved by the fda in at the moment its use is confined to more advanced medical centers where doctors have been trained in how to implant and regulate the device also the procedure isn t covered by all insurance companies so out of pocket costs to patients can be very high it is however covered by medicare he said for uninsured patients the cost of having spine stimulation devices can range from to or more according to a report funded by the washington state department of labor and industries spine stimulation is usually approved only after patients have not responded to other treatment according to blue cross blue shield other insurance companies may have varying policies mccarthy hopes that more doctors will be trained in the procedure and that it will become more available especially because it has the potential to allow patients to stop taking opioids to control their pain one pain specialist not involved with the study saw the benefits of this procedure the results of this study are very significant said dr kiran patel director of neurosurgical pain at lenox hill hospital in new york city it shows long term data that patients experienced significant pain relief and functional improvements she said in my pain practice and career dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy has been one of the most effective technologies available to combat chronic pain patel said i encourage chronic pain patients to seek out physicians who are trained and experienced in the application of dorsal root ganglion stimulation therapy to determine if they are a candidate she said the findings were presented sunday at the american society of anesthesiologists annual meeting in san francisco research presented at meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal more information visit the u s national institute of neurological disorders and stroke for more on back pain,1

en español by dennis thompson healthday reporter sunday sept healthday news it s a perfect case of the enemy of my enemy is my friend a potentially dangerous bacteria appears to target malignant cells and could provide a new means of fighting cancer a small preliminary study reports the bacteria clostridium novyi nt can cause gas gangrene and sepsis if infection is allowed to run amok in a wound but when injected into a tumor clostridium novyi nt appears to both attack the cancer directly and encourage the body s immune response against the cancer cells said lead researcher dr filip janku he is an associate professor at the department of investigational cancer therapeutics at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in houston patients only had one week of exposure to the bacteria but even with that limited exposure we saw quite interesting and in some patients clinically meaningful activity janku said clostridium novyi has been linked to human illness in the u s centers for disease control and prevention reported that a handful of drug users in the united kingdom fell ill or died after their injection sites became infected with the bacteria the strain used in this clinical trial clostridium novyi nt had been weakened to prevent it from producing its toxin which can be lethal in humans janku said the nt stands for non toxic clostridium novyi flourishes in low oxygen environments researchers thought this might make the bacteria a prime candidate for cancer fighting by keeping the infection focused on the tumor site normal tissues even if they are low on oxygen they always have enough oxygen to not allow this bacteria to germinate and proliferate janku explained cancerous tissue is low in oxygen most often in the center of the cancers to test whether the bacteria could help fight cancer researchers injected the tumors of patients with a single dose of clostridium novyi nt ranging from to million spores fifteen of the patients had sarcoma two patients had melanoma and seven had a variety of cancers the researchers said the scientists expected clostridium novyi nt to help fight the tumor in two ways first the bacterial infection itself could cause direct destruction of the tumor cells janku said if that happens it actually helps to increase the presence of tumor specific antigens which are proteins that make a tumor more obvious to the immune system janku said it can prime the immune system to attack the cancer the bacteria also could activate the immune system to fight the cancer even if the infection didn t kill off tumor cells janku added patients in this clinical trial were left with the bacterial infection for one week and then everyone was given antibiotics to kill off the clostridium novyi nt janku said clostridium is actually quite susceptible to antibiotics janku noted the bacteria germinated in the cancers of out of the patients with tumor cells dying off as a result tumor shrinkage of greater than percent was observed in percent of patients however janku said this could be an underestimate since the infection causes surrounding tissue to become inflamed making the lesion appear larger than it actually is following bacterial therapy cancer stabilized in patients when both injected and uninjected lesions were included the stable disease rate was percent the researchers reported the potential for clostridium novyi nt to prompt an immune response against cancer is intriguing said sacha gnjatic who is associate director of the human immune monitoring center at mount sinai in new york city that s where the promise of this type of therapy lies you would expect that the injected lesion would have some type of response because you re disrupting the tumor cells gnjatic said what would be interesting is if this could prime an immune response that would eventually also take care of the non injected tumors that s the holy grail of immunotherapy janku said he s particularly excited by the ability of the bacteria to battle sarcomas which are cancers that occur in bone muscle and soft tissues classic immunotherapy which is now approved or being heavily investigated doesn t seem to be working for a majority of sarcomas janku explained researchers have moved on to the next phase in which patients taking the immunotherapy drug pembrolizumab keytruda will also be treated with a single injection of clostridium novyi nt janku said the researchers suspect the two therapies used in combination will create a strong immune response against cancers however they will have to keep an eye on potential side effects from clostridium novyi nt janku added two patients treated with the heaviest dose of million spores of clostridium novyi nt fell ill with sepsis and or gas gangrene leading researchers to set the maximum tolerated dose at million spores researchers also found the bacteria in the bloodstream of a couple of patients meaning that the infection will need to be carefully tracked janku said that didn t result in clostridium seeding anywhere else outside the injected region but it s a theoretical possibility since we were able to detect it in the blood culture of one or two patients janku said patients also could be susceptible to immune response side effects such as low blood pressure or fever he added the trial results were to be presented sunday at the international cancer immunotherapy conference in new york city the meeting is jointly sponsored by the cancer research institute the association for cancer immunotherapy the european academy of tumor immunology and the american association for cancer research research presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal more information the u s

reuters health people struggling with irritable bowel syndrome ibs might feel better with antidepressants or psychotherapy a recent study suggests people with ibs typically suffer from chronic abdominal pain gas diarrhea and constipation while some people improve with customized diets that avoid certain foods that trigger symptoms this approach doesn t help everyone and some emerging research suggests that the condition may also be influenced by processes in the brain for the current analysis researchers examined data from trials that compared the effects of antidepressants or psychotherapy either alone or in combination versus placebo treatments or usual management in people with ibs rates of no relief were highest with placebo treatments people were percent less likely to have no relief from antidepressants and percent less likely to get no relief from psychotherapy the study found one component of ibs is increased sensitivity to the functions of the bowels simply summarized this means either the nerves taking messages from the bowel to the brain are more sensitive or that the brain is more attentive or reacts in a more emotional manner to the normal messages arising in the bowel or both said dr michael camilleri a researcher at the mayo clinic college of medicine and science in rochester minnesota who wasn t involved in the current study since there are really no medications to reduce the nerve sensitivity some doctors give medications that modulate the function of the brain in the hope that this approach will reduce the ability to sense or emotionally react to the signals or messages arriving from the bowels camilleri said by email psychiatric conditions including depression anxiety and somatisation physical symptoms thought to have psychological origins are common among people with ibs researchers note in the american journal of gastroenterology although the use of antidepressants is common among ibs patients psychotherapy is not the study authors note one limitation of the current study is that the smaller studies used in the analysis had a wide variety of designs and methods for testing the success of treatment researchers note another drawback is that these studies weren t designed to prove how antidepressants or psychotherapy might directly improve ibs symptoms still a psychological evaluation may make sense for ibs patients because it s possible their symptoms might be a byproduct of untreated depression said dr agnieszka kulak bejda a psychiatry researcher at the medical university of białystok in poland who wasn t involved in the study antidepressants may work better for certain types of ibs and the study findings also suggest that the type of medication may matter kulak bejda said by email a family of medicines known as tricyclic antidepressants were more effective at relieving global symptoms of ibs the analysis found but another family of medicines known as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors ssris was better than a placebo for easing symptoms like pain and bloating and improving quality of life the decision to use antidepressants as a form of therapy should be taken individually kulak bejda said the decision should be made after considering all the pros and cons lead author dr alexander ford of the university of leeds in the u k didn t respond to requests for comment source go nature com qxsv k the american journal of gastroenterology online september,1

one single dose of cannabidiol a chemical extracted from cannabis decreases brain abnormalities in people with psychosis according to a study published wednesday by king s college london in jama psychiatry cannidiboil also referred to as cbd acts in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms the chemical is a non intoxicating compound found in cannabis researchers examined participants who were experiencing psychotic symptoms but had not yet been diagnosed with psychosis as well as healthy patients some subjects with symptoms were given placebo while others received a single dose of cbd all the participants then underwent an mri scan while performing a memory task that engages regions of the brain related to psychosis a press release stated results from the mri scans showed that participants displaying psychotic symptoms had abnormal brain activity compared to healthy participants however those that had received cannabidiol showed decreased abnormal activity compared to those who received the placebo these results suggest that cbd can help re adjust brain function to normal levels the researchers aren t entirely sure how cbd works in the brain to reduce psychotic symptoms but the results show that it has a therapeutic effect according to the press release the mainstay of current treatment for people with psychosis are drugs that were first discovered in the s and unfortunately do not work for everyone sagnik bhattacharyya co author of the study said in the release our results have started unravelling the brain mechanisms of a new drug that works in a completely different way to traditional antipsychotics a previous king s college london study also discovered that the chemical has antipsychotic effects and in june the u s food and drug administration approved the first medication made from cannabidiol to treat two rare forms of epilepsy,1
let s talk about your test results my neurologist said she looked as if she had good news instead it was shocking the carotid artery on the left side of my neck one of the brain s two main sources of blood and oxygen was clogged with fatty plaque the doctor said the artery was almost completely blocked there must be a mistake i thought frantically i exercise and am healthy and young actually i m but you know a young you are in danger of a major stroke she said and need an operation immediately the irony wasn t lost on me as a journalist covering the medical field i have spent years writing about strokes most of which are caused by clots blocking blood flow to the brain now i faced the unnerving question am i going to become a weird punch line as in did you see that the guy who writes all those stories about strokes just had a big one a blocked carotid artery didn t seem possible for an active person like me i ve never smoked i ve run lifted weights or done something aerobic like playing tennis pretty much every day of my life i watch what i eat i even wrote an article about how i kept my bad cholesterol in check with diet and exercise not medication while i m addicted to cheese and my weight has climbed some i ve eaten foods like salmon and oatmeal with fervor for more than years so i figured i was exempt from medical crises the diagnosis made me reconsider dilemmas that had once seemed academic for example should older americans be screened for blocked carotid arteries critical paths the carotid arteries are passageways through which blood and oxygen move to a person s brain and face when fatty plaque obstructs an artery the blood supply can be reduced or cut off sometimes resulting in a stroke internal carotid arteries internal external supply blood to brain blockage caused by fatty plaque external carotid arteries blood flow supply blood to face and neck common detail common carotid arteries external internal internal carotid arteries supply blood

and neck internal carotid arteries supply blood to brain detail internal external blockage caused by fatty plaque blood flow common carotid artery clots cause about strokes that lead to deaths annually in the u s and are the primary preventable cause of disability according to the american stroke association carotid disease is a main cause of those strokes nearly strokes a year vascular specialists say yet of those patients have no symptoms before the strokes in a u s task force concluded that people with no symptoms don t have to be screened for carotid disease saying that the risks such as poor surgery outweigh the benefits but the task force a panel of private doctors assigned by law to help set u s medical policy focused on screening in the general population not older patients the task force said there aren t enough carotid caused strokes to warrant screening everyone of course not everyone with carotid blockage will get surgery thousands of people with the condition can benefit from drug therapy my experience along with some evidence from screening of thousands of individuals raises questions about the task force s conclusions the society for vascular surgery recommends screening people over with coronary disease high blood pressure or a history of smoking the task force generally supports screening americans for breast cancer with new cases in women and estimated deaths annually as well as colorectal cancer with new cases and deaths a year government and private insurance pay to screen for these illnesses but not for carotid screening of non symptomatic people which can cost about a person after hearing the jarring news about my dangerously blocked carotid i faced a big decision my wife christa and i live near washington d c our daughter maddie was supposed to be married in san francisco in june a week after the neurologist told me i needed surgery right away suddenly the prospect of being at the wedding seemed iffy conventional wisdom says that among the and older set only those with symptoms should be tested that often means individuals who have had mini strokes which tend to be brief periods in which the patient has something wrong on one side of the body usually for a few minutes symptoms often include slurred speech temporary vision loss a one sided facial droop and arm or leg weakness or numbness vascular surgeon george lavenson jr wrote in in the journal for vascular ultrasound that among people screened for carotid disease during four public screening campaigns between and about were found to have blockage of or more enough to warrant treatment with medication it is hard to understand how many leaders in the medical profession can object to a one to two minute accurate screen of seniors that can find the with silent carotid artery disease dr lavenson said those patients can be evaluated and managed to prevent them from being one of the clot caused strokes we continue to have annually most doctors would have put me in the asymptomatic or less risky category but five years ago i went out for a run of about miles along the potomac river at the end of the run my right leg started shaking that seldom happened again until the past few months when it started recurring more often along with shaking in the right arm my physician joel taubin recommended a neurologist rhanni herzfeld of the neurology center in washington she prescribed tests to discern the cause of the shaking perhaps a pinched nerve incipient epilepsy a neurological disorder or a tumor the results ruled them all out then an mri of my head showed a few white spots on the left side dr herzfeld wondered if i might have had some silent strokes sending tiny bits of artery plaque floating to my brain and now appearing as white spots on the scan fatty plaque accumulates in most people s arteries and can form clots that break off and can cause strokes dr herzfeld ordered a carotid ultrasound of the arteries on both sides of my neck it s a quick painless and very accurate scan moments later we were talking in her office my right carotid artery was perfectly clear she said the left was almost completely blocked and i needed immediate surgery to clear it i asked if we could treat the obstruction with anti platelet medication such as plavix no your blockage is just too extensive dr herzfeld said she recommended that bruce a perler a professor of vascular surgery at johns hopkins hospital in baltimore do the procedure the effectiveness of carotid artery surgery in people without symptoms but major blockage was established two decades ago by the asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis trial funded by the national institutes of health it showed in hospitals in the u s and canada that the risk of stroke or death in surgery patients after a median years was less than half that of people treated only with drugs an international study published in in the lancet showed similar benefits from surgery i consulted with other doctors including one who said this isn t quite an emergency but it s urgent the operation is serious with the rates of stroke and death within days after surgery totaling about in major studies examined by the task force the task force noted that this typical measure can be as high as at some low volume hospitals people considering this operation should ask their hospital surgeon or academic medical center about their rates of stroke and death after surgery few hospitals and surgeons in the u s publish their individual results dr perler s rate was well under he said my risk of stroke was to over five years probably in the first year a week before maddie s wedding my wife and i met with dr perler at johns hopkins on the drive to baltimore we called maddie she sounded frightened and i told her maybe i wouldn t need surgery or could put it off we also told her brothers jamie and will and her sister samantha what was going on dr perler s test confirmed dr herzfeld s findings i definitely needed surgery my artery was almost completely obstructed by echolucent plaque a type that can easily form clots break off and cause strokes we discussed timing dr perler s next surgery day was june that would leave me four days to recover before the wedding he warned that i would be miserable doing that but his next surgery day after that wasn t until june you can safely wait until next week he said but i wouldn t wait two months then he added the words i remember most we ll take good care of you my wife and i decided on june and headed to san francisco for the wedding it was an untraditional ceremony with no white veil or a parade of bridesmaids maddie wore a champagne colored beaded dress i have never seen her so happy except maybe when she was playing my little pony as a year old i was simply happy to be there tom burton and his daughter maddie at her wedding to dan powers at san francisco city hall in june less than a week before mr burton s surgery to unblock a carotid artery photo christina richards photography on the morning of june dr perler started operating at within two hours he had cleared the plaque from my carotid artery later he told me it was so clogged about he couldn t even detect a pulse in it when i woke up i was relieved to see that my eyes and fingers all worked i could think and speak clearly i was even able to complain to the nurses about how lousy i felt i spent two days in intensive care with my blood pressure surging at times about two weeks after the operation i felt pretty normal i ve resumed running and weight lifting i recently played golf for the first time since the surgery and feel great but mostly i feel lucky to have gotten a test that may have saved my life getting screened a national company life line screening will do a carotid screen for or with other tests such as for aortic aneurysms for hospitals accredited labs will do carotid ultrasound tests typically for to but usually only on a doctor s order insurers private and government generally will pay only if the patient has symptoms including a mini stroke the society for vascular surgery s site vascular org can

a simple emergency room intervention can help cut suicide risk enlarge this image toggle caption fangxianuo getty images fangxianuo getty images many people who attempt suicide end up in an emergency room for immediate treatment but few of those suicide survivors get the follow up care they need at a time when they are especially likely to attempt suicide again now a study shows that a simple intervention conducted by staff in emergency departments can reduce the risk of future attempts the intervention involves creating a safety plan for each patient and following up with phone calls after discharge it reduced the odds of suicidal behavior by half says barbara stanley a psychologist at columbia university and the lead author of the study that s a phenomenal difference the study which was published wednesday in jama psychiatry included patients at five veterans affairs hospitals around the country the findings offer a way for hospitals and clinics to help reduce the rising numbers of death by suicide across the country you are not alone if you or someone you know may be considering suicide contact the national suicide prevention lifeline at en español deaf and hard of hearing or the crisis text line by texting when someone goes to the emergency room for a suicide attempt they are at risk of another suicide attempt for the next three months says stanley it s like a ticking time bomb this is the first large scale study of the safety planning intervention which stanley and her group developed in and which has been adopted at hospitals and clinics around the country it can be provided by a physician a nurse or a social worker and requires very little training the interesting thing about the safety planning intervention is that it is a relatively brief intervention and can be used in a lot of different health care settings says brian ahmedani director of behavioral health research at the henry ford health system in detroit who wasn t involved in the new study many health care systems are starting to think about ways to prevent suicide he says that s because as his own work has shown almost percent of people who die by suicide make a health care visit in the year before their death yet only percent of those people have been diagnosed with a mental illness the intervention studied by stanley and her group starts in the er or a clinic before the suicidal patient is released first a health care professional talks with the patient and tries to understand that person s warning signs for a suicide attempt if they ve grappled with being suicidal they know what their warning signs are says stanley for example she says someone might say i find that i m staying in my room not answering the phone not answering texts not answering emails that could be a warning sign others might have repeated thoughts that they re not worthy the next step is for the patient with help from the clinician to come up with a set of coping strategies to help get through moments of intense suicidal ideation for most people this intense state only lasts from a few minutes to a couple of hours she says the coping strategy could be something as simple as playing video games watching tv or talking to a loved one if people contemplating suicide can distract themselves with something they enjoy doing they can bypass that narrow window during which suicidal thoughts can overpower them notes stanley for suicidal people the passage of time is their friend she says the provider also tries to persuade patients to remove or distance themselves from their means of suicide for example if they own a gun they should lock it away or give it to someone who can keep it away from them if you make it really hard to use whatever means you were going to use time passes and you give a chance for suicidal thoughts to subside she says safety planning includes follow up phone calls with the patient the first call is made within hours of being discharged from the er the provider asks the patient how the safety plan is being used and helps revise it if needed the provider also makes sure the patient sees a mental health care provider for long term care a provider keeps calling until the patient has had a second appointment with a therapist or counselor that follow up is key says julie goldstein grumet a psychologist at the zero suicide institute at the education development center a washington d c based nonprofit people often fall off and they don t follow up on their referrals she says and the times during these transitions from acute care settings is one of the highest risk times of suicides to evaluate the effectiveness of the intervention stanley s team looked at five va emergency departments across the country that used it and compared the outcomes with four va emergency rooms that simply discharge patients after stabilizing them among the nearly people who received the intervention half as many people had made suicide attempts or had come very close as those in the control group in other words the intervention had nearly halved the risk of suicide in the six months after discharge two thirds of the people in the treatment group had used their safety plans and they were also twice as likely to get follow up mental health treatment when compared with the control group the study is incredibly important because it shows brief interventions work says goldstein grumet rick a father in missouri says a safety plan may have saved his year old daughter s life npr is leaving off his last name to protect his daughter s privacy in september she came very close to taking her own life when he found out about this from her school principal the next day rick rushed her to the er at mercy hospital jefferson the whole process was overwhelming because you have your year old who s wanting to end her life rick says and she d not shared any of that with us the hospital wasn t part of the new study but was also using a safety planning intervention as part of its efforts to prevent suicides the crisis counselor did such an amazing job of setting up a safety plan that my daughter felt comfortable with he says he says his daughter didn t want to talk to him or her mother about her struggles but she agreed to communicate with them in other ways during times when she felt her urge to take her own life coming back she agreed to watch tv with her mother or call or text her father rick says she usually sends a specific emoji when she is having a bad day and he responds by distracting her with something completely different he says she also agreed to use a crisis help line if things escalated it was something that she could follow through with he says it gave her some confidence and it gave me some confidence he says the plan has helped his daughter get through her suicidal phase and even slowly open up to her parents that s what is so powerful about a safety plan says ahmedani the patient is the author of their safety plan but it s guided by a provider as part of the national strategy for suicide prevention many health care providers have adopted the approaches to prevention outlined in the zero suicide initiative which includes safety planning based on previous evidence showing it works while safety planning has begun to be used across the country it ought to be adopted universally says goldstein grumet it is a brief intervention that hospital workers primary care staff outpatient behavioral health can all be trained in to utilize she says,1

from chaos to calm a life changed by ketamine enlarge this image maria fabrizio for npr maria fabrizio for npr for six years now life has been really good for james he has a great job as the creative director of an advertising firm in new york city he enjoys spending time with his wife and kids and it has all been possible he says because for the past six years he has been taking a drug called ketamine before ketamine james was unable to work or focus his thoughts his mind was filled with violent images and his mood could go from ebullient to dark in a matter of minutes ketamine helped me get my life back says james who asked that we not use his last name to protect his career ketamine was developed as a human and animal anesthetic in the s and almost from the time it reached the market it has also been used as a mind bending party drug but ketamine s story took a surprising turn in when researchers at the national institutes of health showed that an intravenous dose could relieve severe depression in a matter of hours since then doctors have prescribed ketamine off label to thousands of depressed patients who don t respond to other drugs and pharmaceutical companies are testing several new ketamine related drugs to treat depression johnson johnson expects to seek approval for its nasal spray esketamine later this year though the approval would be limited to use in a clinical setting meanwhile doctors have begun trying ketamine on patients with a wide range of psychiatric disorders other than depression and there is now growing evidence it can help people with anxiety bipolar disorder post traumatic stress disorder and perhaps even obsessive compulsive disorder i think it s actually one of the biggest advances in psychiatry in a very long time says dr martin teicher an associate professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school and director of the developmental biopsychiatry research program at mclean hospital ketamine may also offer new hope for people like james who have symptoms of several different psychiatric disorders james had a happy childhood he says but his thoughts were out of control i always felt like i was crossing a freeway and my thoughts were just racing past me he says he spent much of his childhood terrified of an unknown an ambiguous force out there the fear was overwhelming he says i literally slept with the cover over my head with just room to breathe through my mouth until i went to college and there was something else about james his body temperature i overheated constantly he says i would wear shorts all year long in my s in my apartment i would sleep with the windows open in the middle of the winter in his late s james saw a doctor who told him he had attention deficit hyperactivity disorder so he started taking stimulants at first the pills helped him focus then they didn t no matter how many he took he d done well as an idea guy in the advertising industry but now james was trying to work at home and it wasn t going well adhd pills will make you interested in anything he says so i was putting the desk together and taking the desk apart i was putting a laptop stand together and taking it apart i was going in a massive downward spiral james had always suffered from mood swings but now they were rapid and extreme and he couldn t stop thinking about gruesome scenarios like a murderer coming for his family my wife took a summer off to be with me because she was scared of what was going to happen to me he says she would go to work for a few hours then rush home there would be times i d call her just screaming please come home i can t get through another minute eventually james found his way to dr demitri papolos an associate professor of clinical psychiatry at albert einstein college of medicine he was like a whirling dervish when he came into my office papolos says he was extremely fearful and scanning the environment all the time and he overheated at the drop of a hat papolos diagnosed james with a variant of bipolar disorder he calls the fear of harm phenotype it typically appears in childhood and often doesn t respond to traditional psychiatric drugs but papolos has found that the condition does respond to ketamine it s been transformational he says in january papolos published a study of children with the problem they inhaled a nasal mist containing ketamine about twice a week nearly all got dramatically better scientists still aren t sure why ketamine works but there s evidence that it encourages the brain to rewire to alter the connections between cells that process has been linked to recovery from depression and it may also explain why ketamine helps people who have symptoms associated with several different psychiatric disorders i think it s having multiple effects and that means it s probably useful for multiple different disorders teicher says one of those effects involves a part of the brain involved in temperature regulation and that could explain why patients like james usually stop overheating once they are taking ketamine james started taking a ketamine nasal spray every other day he says his response was dramatic one day i turn to

a blood test for different types of cancers could one day help doctors screen for the disease before patients show symptoms researchers at the world s largest gathering of oncologists have said the test called a liquid biopsy screens for cancer by detecting tiny bits of dna released by cancer cells into blood the test had particularly good results for ovarian and pancreatic cancers though the number of cancers detected was small researchers hope the test will become part of a universal screening tool that doctors can use to detect cancer in patients this is potentially the holy grail of cancer research to find cancers that are currently hard to cure at an earlier stage when they are easier to cure said dr eric klein lead author of the research from cleveland clinic s taussig cancer institute we hope this test could save many lives the study by a research team that also included scientists from stanford university was presented at the annual conference of the american society of clinical oncologists in chicago simon stevens the chief executive of nhs england said new techniques such as cancer blood tests could unlock enormous survival gains as well as dramatic productivity benefits in the practice of medicine now as the nhs marks its th anniversary we stand on the cusp of a new era of personalised medicine that will dramatically transform care for cancer and for inherited and rare diseases said stevens the research scrutinised the cases of more than people of whom were cancer free at the time of the study with no diagnosis and of whom had been newly diagnosed with a disease the test was most accurate for diagnosing pancreatic ovarian liver and gallbladder cancers correctly finding the diseases in at least four out of five patients the blood test found lymphoma and myeloma with slightly less accuracy at and and bowel cancer in two out of three patients lung cancer was detected in of patients head and neck cancer was detected in of patients researchers said their results showed promise in the approach of blood screenings for cancer but noted further clinical development was needed the number of patients in whom cancers were detected was small for example although the test detected ovarian cancer with accuracy only ovarian cancers in total were detected nevertheless researchers aim to develop a tool that could be used by for all people regardless of their family history potentially this test could be used for everybody said klein prof nicholas turner from the institute of cancer research in london described the findings as really exciting and as a possible universal screening tool far too many cancers are picked up too late when it is no longer possible to operate and the chances of survival are slim he said the goal is to develop a blood test such as this one that can accurately identify cancers in their earliest stages klein added it is several steps away and more research is needed but it could be given to healthy adults of a certain age such as those over to see if they have early signs of cancer,1
thursday may healthday news because vertigo can have many causes treating it can be difficult but researchers have identified a new type that may be effectively treated with medication these conditions can be difficult to diagnose and quite debilitating for people so it s exciting to be able to discover this new diagnosis of a condition that may respond to treatment said dr ji soo kim a researcher at seoul national university in south korea vertigo episodes of dizziness that can last for minutes or days may be triggered by a number of health issues ranging from an inner ear disorder to tumors in some cases the cause is unclear patients can also experience other uncomfortable symptoms including vomiting headaches and motion sickness for the study researchers recruited people who had vertigo with an unknown cause some had attacks rarely maybe once a year others had them two to three times a week participants also developed nausea headaches and could not tolerate head movements during the attacks to diagnose the new vertigo the researchers had patients sit in a dark room they then moved each patient s head forward and shook it from side to side for about seconds afterwards a video recorded the patients eye movements the researchers noticed that uncontrolled eye movements called nystagmus lasted longer in people with this new form of vertigo the findings were published online may in neurology it s possible that the vertigo occurs when this unstable mechanism is disrupted by factors either within the person s body or in their environment kim said in a journal news release this new form of the condition is called recurrent spontaneous vertigo with head shaking nystagmus thirty five study participants had this form of vertigo they were compared to others whose vertigo is triggered by other conditions including the inner ear disorder meniere s disease those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for seconds twice as long as those with meniere s and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis those with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition the study showed preventative medication was given to of the people with the newly detected type of vertigo of these one third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely the researchers followed the new vertigo patients for an average of years five had no more attacks had an improvement in their condition and only one person had a worsening of symptoms the others outcomes were not revealed more information the u s national library of medicine provides more on vertigo,0

scientists have announced the development of a highly accurate and reliable technique for diagnosing prostate cancer the dundee university based team say they have used an ultrasound process called shear wave elastography swe to detect prostate tumours the method is non invasive and cheaper than current detection techniques prostate cancer has become the most common cancer in men in the uk one in eight men will develop the condition at some point in their lives with more than new cases being diagnosed every year men aged or over men with a family history of prostate cancer and black men are at greatest risk of developing the condition current diagnosis of prostate cancer is extremely inefficient leading to unnecessary treatments for many patients said the dundee university team s leader professor ghulam nabi our new method is far more accurate and also allows us to identify the difference between cancerous and benign tissue in the prostate without the need for invasive surgery the prostate is a small gland in the male reproductive system and is normally about the shape and size of a walnut current methods for determining if a prostate has become cancerous include a physical examination of the prostate known as a digital rectal examination or dre mri scans a biopsy or tests to determine levels of the chemical prostate specific antigen psa in the blood facebook twitter pinterest stephen fry who has had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour says he is excited by the new diagnostic test photograph hgl gc images each carries problems psa results can be unreliable a dre is not good at identifying which cancers are benign and which need treatment mri scans cannot always give a definitive answer while a biopsy carries a risk of infection and is expensive the new method aims to get round the problems by targeting the prostate with ultrasound cancerous tissue is stiffer than normal tissue so shear waves are slowed as they pass through a tumour we have been able to show a stark difference in results between our technology and existing techniques such as mri added nabi the technique has picked up cancers which mri did not reveal we can now see with much greater accuracy what tissue is cancerous where it is and what level of treatment it needs this is a significant step forward the trial tests involved around patients now we need to use this on a wider scale to build more data but there is clearly the potential to really change the way we manage prostate cancer nabi said swe technology is already used in diagnosing breast cancer and liver diseases however to make it applicable to prostate cancer a special probe had to be developed by the team the technique now needs to be tested in a much larger number of men to confirm just how well it can detect the aggressive cancers while also ruling out those who do not have prostate cancer said simon grieveson head of research funding at prostate cancer uk which funded the dundee project with support from the movember foundation with an average of one man dying every minutes from prostate cancer in the uk the need for a more reliable test that can identify dangerous forms of the disease earlier is greater than ever theresa may launches m drive against prostate cancer read more in the past few years a number of celebrities have revealed that they had been diagnosed with prostate cancer and have joined campaigns to raise awareness of the disease including michael parkinson ian mckellen and most recently stephen fry the comedian and former rector of dundee university who this year described how he had surgery to deal with a prostate tumour this breakthrough comes at a time when prostate cancer is being pushed to the forefront of our consciousness in the uk not least because of the disturbing upward trend in its prevalence said fry it is therefore doubly exciting to hear of the new techniques in diagnostic imaging number of cases of prostate cancer diagnosed every year in the uk the number of men who die each year from the disease in proportion of uk men who will get prostate cancer in their lifetime,0

the reports underscore the increasingly important first line role that immunotherapy which unleashes the immune system to destroy cancer cells is taking against the deadliest cancer ad immunotherapy is rapidly in combination with other treatments and on its own dramatically changing the standard of care for lung cancer said leena gandhi an oncologist at nyu langone health who led the study on the immunotherapy chemotherapy combination called keynote instead of chemo being the backbone on which to improve immunotherapy is now the backbone on which we build ad lung cancer is the second most common malignancy in the united states after breast cancer the american cancer society estimates that people will be diagnosed with the disease this year and will die of it most patients diagnosed with advanced lung cancer disease that has spread beyond its original site initially receive chemotherapy which provides only marginal benefit but the disease is so lethal that many patients don t survive long enough to try second or third line treatments so researchers are trying to develop and use more effective approaches earlier ad the trial that grabbed much of the spotlight monday is a randomized effectiveness study that involved more than untreated patients with advanced nonsquamous non small cell lung cancer a common type of the disease the patients did not have cancer causing mutations one group was treated only with chemo while the other got an immunotherapy drug called keytruda plus chemo some of the results had been released previously but not specific details ad after a median follow up time of months gandhi said the patients in the combination group were percent less likely to die compared with patients in the chemo only arm for the first time adding another drug has significantly impacted the long term outlook for those patients she said ad scientists who weren t involved in the study agreed that it was highly significant h jack west an oncologist at swedish medical center in seattle said it is literally practice changing immediately roy herbst an oncologist at yale cancer center said that most lung cancer patients now will be offered immunotherapy in some form much earlier than before still he said the approach was not a cure and there is a lot of room for improvement the estimated proportion of patients in the combination therapy group who were alive and whose disease had not gotten worse at a year was about percent about double the proportion for the chemo only group ad last may the food and drug administration approved the keytruda chemo combination based on an early stage trial but many doctors did not adopt it because the trial was small and didn t initially show a survival benefit gandhi said ad experts said it was especially significant that the study showed that patients benefited from the keytruda chemo combination regardless of the levels of a protein called pd l found on their cancer cells researchers already had known that patients with high levels of the protein were more likely to respond to immunotherapy last week in a related development merck which makes keytruda reported that a different trial showed that the medication prolonged survival even when used alone compared with chemo experts said they will have to see more details before they can determine whether the medication is better used alone or with chemo ad in a second study published monday researchers used two other immunotherapy medications opdivo and yervoy both made by bristol myers squibb to treat newly diagnosed patients with advanced non small cell lung cancer with a high number of mutations in their tumors ad the patients experienced a significantly longer period during which their disease did not worsen compared with people who received only chemotherapy said memorial sloan kettering cancer center oncologist matthew hellmann who led the study he said the results established the double immunotherapy combination as a first line treatment for patients with a high tumor mutational burden but that it was too early to know whether the treatment leads to longer survival and he said the trial showed that tumor mutational burden is a reliable way to predict who will benefit from the medications ad another study published monday used immunotherapy in a different way for patients with early stage lung cancer researchers at johns hopkins and memorial sloan kettering gave patients two doses of opdivo the first a month before surgery the second two weeks before the operation to try to stimulate anti tumor activity and reduce the risk of relapse ad nine of the patients who got opdivo had a major pathologic response a sharp reduction in the number of cancer cells found in the tumors removed by surgery drew pardoll director of hopkins bloomberg kimmel institute for cancer immunotherapy said that it is too early to know whether the findings will translate into longer survival but if future studies show that he added then immunotherapy might be used to augment or even replace chemo typically given before surgery read more ad,1
researchers report some of the most encouraging results yet for treating lung cancer with the latest immune based treatments most of which have been approved to treat other types of tumors in three papers presented at the american association for cancer research annual meeting and published simultaneously in the new england journal of medicine lung cancer experts found innovative ways to weaken lung tumors to improve people s chances of surviving the disease there is definitely a high unmet need says patrick forde assistant professor of oncology and associate member of the bloomberg kimmel institute for cancer immunotherapy at johns hopkins of the lack of effective treatments for lung cancer currently more than half of people who are treated even at early stages of the disease can expect the cancer to return and chemotherapy typically leads to only a improvement in people s chances of living five years but an up to chance of being exposed to serious toxicities health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now the studies involve a group of immune based cancer drugs called checkpoint inhibitors which are designed to rip away the molecular cloak behind which cancer cells hide from the immune system the medications target a protein called pd its related pd l or ctla which protect the body s cells from being killed by immune cells because tumors are normal cells growing out of control they take advantage of this molecular security blanket to avoid getting detected by immune cells a series of checkpoint inhibitor drugs first approved in initially for treating melanoma expose the tumor cells to the immune system based on their success in treating skin cancers scientists are now studying this group of drugs in a number of other cancers including tumors in the lung in one study called checkmate researchers tested whether a combination of two of these checkpoint inhibitor drugs could keep tumors from growing better than the standard treatment of chemotherapy in people with advanced non small cell lung cancer nsclc nearly people were randomly assigned to receive either the combination of the immune based drugs or the traditional chemotherapy treatment after nearly a year the lung cancer in people taking the immunotherapy was less likely to have progressed than among people getting chemotherapy what s more say the study s authors doctors may also figure out which people are most likely to respond to the two drug combination of nivolumab opdivo and ipilimumab yervoy and which are not in the study he and his colleagues found that people whose tumors had more mutations enjoyed the longest time period during which their cancers did not progress currently lung cancer treatments rely heavily on chemotherapy but doctors are shifting toward a more customized and precise way of treating each person s disease in order to improve their chances of survival for example newer targeted therapy drugs home in on specific genetic mutations that are responsible for driving a person s cancer doctors can also determine if a person s lung cancer is genetically vulnerable to the checkpoint inhibitor drugs tested in the current study putting together everything that doctors currently know about lung tumors more than half of people with lung cancer can avoid chemotherapy and get more precision based treatments says dr matthew hellmann of the memorial sloan kettering cancer center mskcc lead author of the study in addition a year after treatment three times more people on immunotherapy were doing well compared to those who just got chemotherapy the results could play a role in changing standard treatments for people diagnosed with advanced nsclc by making a strong case for starting people immediately on the immunotherapy combination rather than giving them chemotherapy first as many doctors currently do while nivolumab is approved for treating metastatic nsclc for example that indication calls for using it if the disease continues to progress either during or after chemotherapy this combination of nivolumab and ipilimumab showed that the paired drugs could be more effective when begun as the first treatment instead of chemotherapy get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now choose your country united

folder there may also be other ways to improve outcomes for people with advanced nsclc in another study researchers found that combining standard chemotherapy with another immune based checkpoint inhibitor pembrolizumab keytruda helped them live nearly four months longer on average than people treated with just chemotherapy people getting the combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy were less likely to die after months than people receiving chemotherapy alone the magnitude of benefit was unexpected and great to see says dr leena gandhi associate professor of medicine at nyu langone medical center and co author of the study pembrolizumab is already approved for treating about to of people with advanced nsclc who have a certain genetic profile that makes their cancer vulnerable to the drug but this latest study expands that population to many more people who may benefit from the immunotherapy if the medication is combined with chemotherapy the results are even more encouraging for people with early stage lung cancer in a third small study of people diagnosed with early stage disease researchers led by a team at johns hopkins and mskcc found that giving people two doses of nivolumab before surgery to remove lung tumors shrunk those tumors drastically and lowered chances of relapse thanks to its ability to jump start the immune system to fight the cancer when the scientists analyzed the tumors they had cut out they found that in about half of the people treated with nivolumab the growths showed significant destruction by immune cells meaning that nivolumab had unmasked the tumors as foreign and allowed the immune system s killer cells to attack them and when the scientists studied the blood of the people receiving the immunotherapy they discovered a close match between the types of immune cells in the blood and certain targets on the tumor cells suggesting that nivolumab had released the immune system to pump out the appropriate cells it needed to tackle the cancer we expected to see some response but i don t think we expected to see a significant response says forde to give you some idea of how significant that is with chemotherapy we normally see the same degree of response around of the time forde says that the strong response seen in people at the beginning of the disease could suggest that immunotherapies might be useful in re training the immune system to fight cancer for long periods of time possibly even a lifetime the holy grail is to have a relatively non toxic therapy that could potentially use the body s own immune system to prevent recurrence he says and while our study is only with patients the early indications from this study are very positive taken together the results could fundamentally change the way lung cancer is treated significantly improving people s ability to both hold off lung cancer for longer periods of time as well as live longer with the disease contact us at,1
i love my local ymca for many reasons beyond my daily swim top of the list the friendships and conversations in the locker room that are frequent sources of valuable information connections and motivation for example i recently overheard a discussion about y members and friends of members who had experienced devastating attacks of shingles including one woman who nearly lost an eye and another who was left with unrelenting nerve pain that was the push i needed to end my procrastination about getting the new shingles vaccine shingrix which was approved by the food and drug administration last october after studies involving people showed it to be far more effective at preventing this disease than the first shingles vaccine zostavax which i had had a decade earlier the centers for disease control and prevention recommends that people and older including those previously immunized with zostavax should now get the shingrix vaccine the process was surprisingly simple and less costly than i had anticipated list price is for the two part shot without insurance all i needed was a prescription from my doctor i took it to my local pharmacy where a staff pharmacist administered the vaccine i ll get the second part the same way in may my medicare part d insurance covered it with a co pay for each part the cost may be higher if the vaccine is administered in a doctor s office so check first many millions of americans especially those older than are susceptible to an eventual attack of shingles caused by the very same virus that causes chickenpox once this virus varicella zoster infects a person it lies dormant for decades in nerve roots ready to pounce when the immune system is weakened say by stress medication trauma or disease one third of americans eventually get shingles but the risk rises with age and by age half of adults will have had at least one outbreak of shingles,1
watch chief medical correspondent dr sanjay gupta s cnn special report weed pot vs pills on sunday april at p m et cnn experts have proposed using medical marijuana to help americans struggling with opioid addiction now two studies suggest that there is merit to that strategy the studies published monday in the journal jama internal medicine compared opioid prescription patterns in states that have enacted medical cannabis laws with those that have not one of the studies looked at opioid prescriptions covered by medicare part d between and while the other looked at opioid prescriptions covered by medicaid between and the researchers found that states that allow the use of cannabis for medical purposes had million fewer daily doses of opioids prescribed per year under medicare part d compared with those states without medical cannabis laws opioid prescriptions under medicaid also dropped by in states with medical cannabis laws compared with states without such laws according to the studies this study adds one more brick in the wall in the argument that cannabis clearly has medical applications said david bradford professor of public administration and policy at the university of georgia and a lead author of the medicare study and for pain patients in particular our work adds to the argument that cannabis can be effective medicare part d the optional prescription drug benefit plan for those enrolled in medicare covers more than million americans including those or older medicaid provides health coverage to more than million low income individuals in the us according to the program s website medicare and medicaid publishes this data and we re free to use it and anyone who s interested can download the data bradford said but that means that we don t know what s going on with the privately insured and the uninsured population and for that i m afraid the data sets are proprietary and expensive this crisis is very real the new research comes as the united states remains entangled in the worst opioid epidemic the world has ever seen opioid overdose has risen dramatically over the past years and has been implicated in over deaths since more than the number of americans killed in world war ii as somebody who treats patients with opioid use disorders this crisis is very real these patients die every day and it s quite shocking in many ways said dr kevin hill an addiction psychiatrist at beth israel deaconess medical center and an assistant professor of psychiatry at harvard medical school who was not involved in the new studies we have had overuse of certain prescription opioids over the years and it s certainly contributed to the opioid crisis that we re feeling he added i don t think that s the only reason but certainly it was too easy at many points to get prescriptions for opioids like opioids marijuana has been shown to be effective in treating chronic pain as well as other conditions such as seizures multiple sclerosis and certain mental disorders according to the national institute on drug abuse research suggests that the cannabinoid and opioid receptor systems rely on common signaling pathways in the brain including the dopamine reward system that is central to drug tolerance dependence and addiction all drugs of abuse operate using some shared pathways for example cannabinoid receptors and opioid receptors coincidentally happen to be located very close by in many places in the brain hill said so it stands to reason that a medication that affects one system might affect the other but unlike opioids marijuana has little addiction potential and virtually no deaths from marijuana overdose have been reported in the united states according to bradford no one has ever died of cannabis so it has many safety advantages over opiates bradford said and to the extent that we re trying to manage the opiate crisis cannabis is a potential tool comparing states with and without medical marijuana laws in order to evaluate whether medical marijuana could function as an effective and safe alternative to opioids the two teams of researchers looked at whether opioid prescriptions were lower in states that had active medical cannabis laws and whether those states that enacted these laws during the study period saw reductions in opioid prescriptions both teams in fact did find that opioid prescriptions were significantly lower in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws the team that looked at medicaid patients also found that the four states that switched from medical use only to recreational use alaska colorado oregon and washington saw further reductions in opioid prescriptions according to hefei wen assistant professor of health management and policy at the university of kentucky and a lead author on the medicaid study we saw a or reduction in opioid prescriptions in colorado and oregon wen said and in alaska and washington the magnitude was a little bit smaller but still significant the first state in the united states to legalize marijuana for medicinal use was california in since then states and the district of columbia have approved some form of legalized cannabis all of these states include chronic pain either directly or indirectly in the list of approved medical conditions for marijuana use according to bradford the details of the medical cannabis laws were found to have a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns the researchers found states that permitted recreational use for example saw an additional reduction in opioid prescriptions under medicaid compared with those states that permitted marijuana only for medical use according to wen the method of procurement also had a significant impact on opioid prescription patterns states that permitted medical dispensaries regulated shops that people can visit to purchase cannabis products had million fewer opioid prescriptions filled per year under medicare part d while those that allowed only home cultivation had million fewer opioid prescriptions per year we found that there was about a reduction in any opiate use when dispensaries were turned on and that was statistically significant and about a reduction in any opiate use when home cultivation only was turned on bradford said so dispensaries are much more powerful in terms of shifting people away from the use of opiates the impact of these laws also differed based on the class of opioid prescribed specifically states with medical cannabis laws saw fewer morphine prescriptions and fewer hydrocodone prescriptions compared with states that did not have these laws according to bradford fentanyl prescriptions under medicare part d also dropped by in states that had enacted medical cannabis laws though the difference was not statistically significant bradford said fentanyl is a synthetic opioid like heroin that can be prescribed legally by physicians it is to times more potent than morphine and even a small amount can be fatal according to the national institute on drug abuse i know that many people including the attorney general jeff sessions are skeptical of cannabis bradford said but you know the attorney general needs to be terrified of fentanyl a call to action this is not the first time researchers have found a link between marijuana legalization and decreased opioid use a study showed that states with medical cannabis laws had fewer opioid overdose deaths between and a study in also found that the legalization of recreational marijuana in colorado in reversed the state s upward trend in opioid related deaths there is a growing body of scientific literature suggesting that legal access to marijuana can reduce the use of opioids as well as opioid related overdose deaths said melissa moore new york deputy state director for the drug policy alliance in states with medical marijuana laws we have already seen decreased admissions for opioid related treatment and dramatically reduced rates of opioid overdoses some skeptics though argue that marijuana legalization could actually worsen the opioid epidemic another study for example showed a positive association between illicit cannabis use and opioid use disorders in the united states but there may be an important difference between illicit cannabis use and legalized cannabis use according to hill as we have all of these states implementing these policies it s imperative that we do more research hill said we need to study the effects of these policies and we really haven t done it to the degree that we should the two recent studies looked only at patients enrolled in medicaid and medicare part d meaning the results may not be generalizable to the entire us population follow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter but both hill and moore agree that as more states debate the merits of legalizing marijuana in the coming months and years more research will be needed to create consistency between cannabis science and cannabis policy there is a great deal of movement in the northeast with new hampshire and new jersey being well positioned to legalize adult use moore said i believe there are also ballot measures to legalize marijuana in arizona florida missouri nebraska and south dakota as well that voters will decide on in fall hill called the new research a call to action and added we should be studying these policies but unfortunately the policies have far outpaced the science at this point,1
we thought we d be young forever said francis who co anchors a radio news program in washington d c the big wake up call is when our bodies wear down take elliott francis who had his second hip replacement surgery in february growing up he was a jumper and a rebounder he said scooping basketballs off the rim during roxbury pickup games and later playing in high school and college for a generation that pounded its joints doing aerobics running marathons and carving up the ski slopes it s time to roll out the spare parts baby boomers determined to keep moving no matter what wear and tear and arthritis have wrought are fueling a surge in joint replacements taking advantage of improved artificial joints and surgical methods aging americans are getting so many new hips knees shoulders and ankles that orthopedic surgeons are having trouble meeting the demand advertisement hip replacements in the united states more than doubled between and from to a year according to the most recent data from the healthcare cost and utilization project which tracks hospital discharges knee replacements increased at an even faster clip in the same period from to the procedures can cost up to for knees and for hips though the prices vary widely among medicare and private insurers which typically bear the bulk of the cost the average age of patients listed in the american joint replacement registry is about with millions more boomers still in their late s and early s the trend will only continue they re aging they ve had some injuries and they want to continue to be active into their s s and s and they need a good joint to do that said dr david mattingly surgeon in chief at new england baptist hospital in boston one of the nation s top orthopedics centers advertisement a patient looked at joint replacement models suzanne kreiter globe staff the surgical surge has created an expanding brigade of bionic baby boomers whose artificial parts are accompanied by sky high expectations something doctors struggle to manage despite steady improvement in technology and outcomes replacement joints don t create superhumans still many patients are lifelong fitness buffs who begin plotting their return to the gym the golf course or the cross country skiing trails the moment they are discharged from the hospital winthrop retiree john carver is already back at the fitness center after having replacement surgery on his right knee in february my goal is to get back to an hour minutes on the elliptical and some back exercises he said a marine veteran who ran the new york city marathon the year he turned carver has scheduled a similar procedure on his left knee in may early enough to be ready for golf season for those who are still working at physically demanding jobs there are other considerations i m up and down the scaffolding all day said david smith of arlington a construction superintendent in boston who had a hip replacement in january my first focus was to just get on my feet so i can work another years so i said ok let s get this done smith who played hockey in college and as an adult and spent years lifting heavy equipment on building sites plans to return to his job this spring but he has already resumed golfing on a march trip to visit his son and his family in atlanta and he promised i will get on the skates again advertisement like smith many boomers endured months or years of pain before surgery pain caused by bone on bone friction when cartilage deterioration eroded their bone cushioning some took multiple cortisone shots hoping to avoid surgeries but having had the procedures many say they wish they d done it sooner west newbury s town clerk mike mccarron played high school and college football and once climbed mount washington in the winter mccarron underwent two knee replacements simultaneously in i had a coupon he joked now he runs on the treadmill at his merrimack valley gym and hikes in the maine wilderness susan nadworny of melrose owned an aerobics studio in boston s north end during the s and s there she spent three or four hours a day leading high impact exercise classes nadworny who now works as a public policy advocate for people with disabilities had knee replacement surgery last april nearly a year later she pedals an indoor exercise bicycle and spends an hour a day walking dogs in the woods the vast majority of joint surgery patients report much less pain and greater mobility afterward with success rates topping percent according to the american academy of orthopedic surgeons a physicians organization in patient reported surveys some still complain of pain and tissue inflammation after their procedures smaller numbers suffer serious complications ranging from blood clotting to hospital acquired infections advertisement at new england baptist a physical therapist showed patients about to have joints replaced how to use crutches suzanne kreiter globe staff new england baptist expects to perform a record knee and hip replacements at its mission hill campus this year a nearly sixfold increase from the annually it did in the mid s most of the busy guys do to a week mattingly said last year the average salary for joint replacement specialists topped reported the dallas consulting firm merritt hawkins associates compared with just over for family doctors because of improvements in materials and the way they re treated and sterilized implants which include polyethylene and titanium alloys don t wear down as fast as they once did implants now have a percent chance of lasting two decades much longer than in the past mattingly said while physical activity obviously plays a role in joint deterioration genetics may be the biggest factor in determining who needs a replacement and when he said knee replacements were first offered in the s and hip replacements began in the s so many boomers are facing the same surgeries their fathers and mothers underwent but boomers may have a tougher time coming to terms with the reality that a new body part doesn t mean they can resume all of the high impact activities that were a major part of their lives nobody will return to playing football mattingly said the person who struggles is the one who s done long distance running for years and just doesn t want to give it up technology could eventually change that joint implants have become more customized to suit individual patients but a billerica company is pushing the personalization trend further conformis inc uses d printing and imaging software to more precisely tailor replacement joints it sells between and personalized knee implants a year still a small share of the market and last year won us regulatory approval for its first hip implants advertisement the baby boomer explosion is a big deal in health care said conformis chief executive mark augusti technology has to be part of the solution baby boomers expect to be more active as they get older and have higher expectations about quality of life in their later years stephanie donvan of arlington who received a conformis knee replacement in may recalled feeling like she was carrying a dead tree trunk before the surgery now she said i m out walking my lab about five miles a day every day i can run in the snow and ride my bike i have complete range of motion we want to keep going

the pap test has already reduced the incidence of cervical cancer by more than now it may become a key step in the early detection of two other gynecological malignancies ovarian and endometrial cancers that have been notorious killers because they re typically caught so late a new study has found that by genetically analyzing the harvest of cells from a pap smear doctors could identify of endometrial cancers and of ovarian cancers some of those cancers were in their earliest stages when they re more likely to respond to treatment when the johns hopkins university researchers tested an alternative means of collecting cells a longer brush that sweeps cells from the lining of the uterus they positively identified endometrial cancer in of cases and ovarian cancer in of cases and when they added a blood test to the ovarian cancer screening regimen they were able to detect that deadly cancer in of patients who had it advertisement having the possibility to detect these cancers earlier is very exciting said dr nickolas papadopoulos a coauthor of the study which was published wednesday in the journal science translational medicine it s the latest example of how scientists hope to detect cancer earlier and with greater precision by looking in blood and other easily accessible fluids for cells that bear the telltale genetic mutations of cancer while such liquid biopsies have not yet made their way into widespread use they hold the promise of revolutionizing cancer screening in january the same research team presented promising findings in the journal science on a blood test called cancerseek that s capable of detecting malignancies of the liver stomach pancreas esophagus colon lung and breast earlier this week they published findings in the journal elife on a urine test to detect cancers of the urothelial tract or urinary bladder advertisement as a screening test for cervical cancer the pap smear has been a staple of gynecological checkups for more than six decades it s named for dr george papanicolaou the physician who first showed that cancerous cells of the cervix could be detected by microscopic inspection the pap test has dramatically driven down deaths from cervical cancer which used to be one of the most common cancers in women however the test does a poor job of detecting endometrial or ovarian cancer which together kills about women in the united states each year women thought to be at high risk of those cancers are sometimes screened with a blood test that detects an immune system biomarker called ca or with a transvaginal ultrasound that looks for telltale thickening of the uterus endometrial wall but those tests fail to detect many cancers and also send up a lot of false alarms so they re frequently not used until a woman complains of symptoms the result is often a diagnosis at an advanced stage when treatments are more invasive and less likely to be successful tumor cells from ovarian and endometrial cancers shed and are carried into the uterine cavity and endocervical canal where they can be collected with the tao brush or the pap brush y wang et al science translational medicine in the new study the researchers measured the accuracy of their papseek test on women they already knew that of the women were free of either cancer and of them had either ovarian or endometrial cancer researchers collected cervical fluid samples with a pap smear brush and a slightly longer tool called a tao brush which reaches beyond the cervix and into the uterus nearer to where ovarian and endometrial cancers take hold then they used the papseek test to sequence the samples focusing on genes that tend to develop mutations in those cancers the test also checked the samples for aneuploidy the presence of abnormal numbers of chromosomes in cells when the researchers used the longer tao brush they were able to detect endometrial cancer in all but of the women who had the disease and close to half of the ovarian cancers combined with the fact that these tests were performed with a mere swipe of the uterine wall these measures of sensitivity the ability to detect cancers that are actually there represent a major improvement over the screening tests currently available advertisement when they supplemented the analysis of pap and tao brush samples with a hunt for mutated cells in the women s blood they were able to detect ovarian cancer in well over half of those who had it when endometrial and ovarian cancers are especially aggressive and when they have progressed to advanced stages they are easier to find with existing screening methods but an important measure of a test s usefulness is whether it can detect the most aggressive types of cancer before they have metastasized by that measure too the papseek test looked promising when it was used to scan the tao brush samples it identified of the high grade endometrial cancers in patients while their malignancy was still confined to the endometrium it was also able to identify of those with high grade ovarian cancers before they had spread just as important the tests were remarkably good at avoiding false positive signals which would needlessly alarm women and lead to riskier and more invasive tests to confirm a diagnosis for both types of cancer the papseek test s specificity its ability to accurately recognize the absence of disease approached papadopoulos said he was surprised and heartened that the pap test or a close variant of it could be repurposed to look for gynecological cancers that are typically caught way too late while the team hopes to improve the test s sensitivity he said that even this early version would likely boost women s chances of earlier detection by a considerable margin it doesn t have to be perfect to help at least some women who might otherwise die of these stealthy cancers papadopoulos said women are already used to having pap smears and everyone can give a

a new class of drugs could be life changing for millions of women in menopause who suffer with hot flashes a medication being tested in the u k and here in the u s may be the key to alleviating several of the uncomfortable menopause side effects and hopefully without the need for hormone replacement therapy according to an analysis published in the journal menopause the potential for this drug class to really improve many of the symptoms of the menopause such as hot flashes difficulty sleeping weight gain and poor concentration is huge lead author dr julia prague of the imperial college london to see the lives of our participants change so dramatically and so quickly was so exciting and suggests great promise for the future of this new type of treatment about percent of postmenopausal women experience vasomotor symptoms the familiar hot flashes which in some cases last for years this new drug labeled mle for research is being tested in clinical trials and offers hope for curtailing postmenopausal symptoms the previous go to therapy was supplemental estrogen which proved to have side effects like blood clots or even breast cancer mle is taken orally and works by blocking one brain chemical called neurokinin b from binding to its receptor the interaction between these two has been linked to the regulation of temperature in the brain when someone is deficient in estrogen like in menopause we were able to identify this new therapeutic use for the compound which had previously been sitting on the shelf unused and within three years show this type of drug may make a tangible difference to the lives of millions of women professor waljit dhillo an nihr research professor from the department of medicine at imperial college london said previous studies showed that giving women an extra amount of the brain chemical neurokinin b resulted in hot flashes and genetic differences between people could be the reason why some have more of the chemical or more severe postmenopausal symptoms than others this small study done at the imperial college of london involved women between the ages of and years who did not have a period for at least months the definition of menopause and who suffered at least seven hot flashes per day the groups received either mle twice a day for weeks or a placebo pill on the same schedule two weeks later the groups swapped their treatments at the end of the study those who took mle had the frequency of their hot flashes reduced by percent and the severity of hot flashes decreased by percent this improvement started as early as three days after first taking the drug and relief continued for the whole month of treatment we already knew this compound could be a game changer for menopausal women and get rid of three quarters of their hot flushes in four weeks dhillo added but this new analysis confirms the beneficial effect is obtained very quickly within just three days sleep and concentration improved after three days too which was an added bonus the researchers noted that those improvements could have been related to the reduction in hot flashes all this is promising but more research is needed and possibly a variation in the drug a previous study on mle was associated with liver toxicity in a few participants which resolved when they stopped taking it they hope slightly modifying the drug may improve that side effect larger studies on mle are underway in the u s and u k that will help gain an understanding of the drug s safety and effectiveness like any new drug safety and effectiveness have to be proven to the fda before the drug can be offered in the u s najibah rehman md mph is a third year preventive medicine resident at the university of michigan working in the abc news medical unit,1

this chef lost pounds and reversed prediabetes with a digital program enlarge this image toggle caption katherine streeter for npr katherine streeter for npr people who are diagnosed with prediabetes can delay or prevent the disease if they change their lifestyle and lose a significant amount of weight but here s the challenge how can people be motivated to eat healthier and move more increasingly the answer might include digital medicine just telling people to do things doesn t work says sean duffy ceo of omada health if it were easy there wouldn t be more than million adults in the u s with prediabetes omada has rolled out a digital program delivered on smartphones and other devices that incorporates all the ingredients known to help people overhaul their habits it includes e coaching peer support education diet and exercise tracking and electronic nudging forget to weigh in or track your meals you ll get texts or emails reminding you to do it week by week we have lessons on different themes duffy explains they re interactive and there s little games to keep it dynamic participants are matched with a group of peers online and they re led by a coach who they can text or email back and forth with we call it the symphony effect duffy says because there are multiple methods working together to help participants stay on track getting started sometimes fear is a good motivator for losing weight don speranza is in his late s and lives on a farm along the columbia river in washington state where he runs a bed and breakfast with his wife he s also the chef at the inn i m immersed in food all day speranza says last year he received an email from his doctor at kaiser permanente with some test results it was like a gut punch speranza says enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of don speranza courtesy of don speranza based on his weight which had been crept up to pounds and the results of his bloodwork to test his glucose he was diagnosed with prediabetes this means his blood sugar level was elevated but not yet high enough to be diagnosed with the condition it was a real come to jesus moment speranza recalls he knew that diabetes increased the risk of heart disease and can lead to many other complications including vision loss and amputations when he signed up for the omada program the first thing he received was a scale he began to weigh himself daily he also began to track what he was eating each day he d log his weight and meals and upload the data to a dashboard his coach could see the data too and give him advice and encouragement oh my coach speranza says i can t sing her praises enough she was so responsive even though they never met in person they bonded he took her advice and suggestions he realized for instance that he ate too much of the wrong things homemade breads and croissants pasta and pizza speranza ticks off the list of baked treats with a mix of reverence and resolve in his voice speranza realized he had to change his relationship with these foods temporarily he cut out all these refined carbohydrates he had to train himself to resist all the treats he bakes for his guests instead he began to fill his plate with more protein vegetables and healthy fats he raises animals on his organic farm so he eats pastured meats and a lot of salmon week by week i d make one or two little changes at a time speranza says it was a game changer the weight began to fall off and he started to move more his coach nudged him to switch up his morning routine he says he was accustomed to sitting each morning for an hour or so just drinking coffee now i ll start the coffee he says but before he drinks it i ll go outside and walk he tracks his movement withe a wearable electronic device he began with steps logged during his morning walk but has now increased his steps significantly and he rides a stationary bike too now i can almost keep up with my wife speranza says with a laugh since last may he has lost about pounds to be exact but it fluctuates a bit and his blood sugar has returned to the normal range he no longer has prediabetes i feel so much better speranza says as a baker he buys flour in pound sacks now when i look at the sacks i m aghast to think that s what i was carrying around success is not automatic not every omada health participant makes the progress they re aiming for after all pulling off these changes is difficult i m still on the journey to get to more optimal health says lonny northrup who lives in utah he lost weight while participating in the program but when he hit a plateau in his weight loss he felt stuck and he says he didn t get the personal support he would have liked from the program for many days in a row i got an email saying hey we noticed you didn t step on the scale he says for some reason that didn t get escalated to the coach so he says that was a disappointment overall he says he would recommend the omada health program to a friend i got really good specific recommendations that worked for me and my lifestyle northrup says and he says the convenience of having the program delivered on a smartphone was key too there is some evidence that these kinds of programs are working a recent pilot study with utah based intermountain healthcare that included about people all of whom were at high risk of type diabetes found that percent of the participants completed the omada program and lost at least percent of their body weight and about in participants lost percent of their body weight or more that s promising because there s evidence that a percent body weight loss cuts the risk of developing diabetes by about percent this is one of the most exciting things says mark greenwood a physician with intermountain omada health is not the only player in this space the centers for disease control and prevention recognizes many diabetes prevention lifestyle change programs delivered both in person and online including vida which bills itself as a health transformation team that is data and tech driven additionally traditional players in the weight loss space such as weight watchers now offer some similar incentives such as personal coaching greenwood says he d like to see many more patients try diabetes prevention programs and he says he s pleased with the results of the pilot study of omada s program the data really does

reuters health people who get minimally invasive surgery to replace damaged heart valves have an easier time completing daily tasks and a better quality of life after the procedure a research review suggests the analysis focused on people with what s known as aortic stenosis which occurs when the large blood vessels leading away from the heart narrow forcing it to work much harder to pump blood the condition tends to develop with age and can lead to chest pain shortness of breath fatigue and heart failure patients in the study had minimally invasive surgery that fixes the problem by inserting a replacement valve to send blood around the damaged valve while leaving it in place this procedure known as a transcatheter aortic valve replacement is done by threading a catheter to the heart through a small incision in the chest or from the large artery in the groin it doesn t require cutting open the chest afterward patients could walk significantly further in six minute walking tests used to assess their functional capacity on average they added almost meters feet to their performance before surgery in addition patients reported clinically meaningful improvements in their quality of life and their ability to complete daily tasks after surgery the results offer fresh evidence that transcatheter aortic valve replacement can help ease symptoms like shortness of breath and fatigue that limit the ability to handle physical exertion said dr david cohen director of cardiovascular research at saint luke s mid america heart institute in kansas city missouri these symptoms lead to reduced functional capacity inability to perform physical exertion and also impact a patient s overall sense of wellbeing and quality of life cohen who wasn t involved in the study said by email by replacing the diseased aortic valve transcatheter aortic valve replacement and surgical valve replacement reverses these effects and generally allows the patient to return to his or her normal quality of life limited only by the impact of other conditions that the patient may have cohen said by email overall the current analysis included patients from a total of previously published studies on outcomes for this type of surgery participants were years old on average and they were typically considered high risk surgical patients due to either advanced age or other medical issues the smaller studies in the analysis ranged in size from to patients and most of them followed patients for as long as six to months after surgery one limitation of the current analysis is that many of these smaller studies were not controlled experiments designed to prove whether or how transcatheter aortic valve replacement might improve quality of life lead study author nicola straiton of the university of sydney and colleagues note in age and ageing straiton didn t respond to emails seeking comment people who don t get this type of minimally invasive surgery may instead get a more invasive procedure that involves surgeons cutting open the chest to repair a damaged valve surgeons may also perform what s known as angioplasty which uses a catheter to insert a tiny balloon and inflate it to open the valve sometimes surgeons will also insert a stent or tiny wire mesh cage to keep the artery propped open results of the current study reaffirm that a minimally invasive procedure can be a viable option even for elderly people who are high risk surgical patients said dr samir kapadia a cardiovascular medicine researcher at the cleveland clinic in ohio replacing the aortic valve improves functional capacity kapadia who wasn t involved in the study said by email transcatheter aortic valve replacement is an important minimally invasive treatment option for replacing the aortic valve that is narrowed source bit ly emhtuh age and ageing online january,1
blood and urine test believed to be first of its kind could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders scientists in britain say they have developed a blood and urine test that can detect autism in children researchers at the university of warwick said the test believed to be the first of its kind could lead to earlier diagnosis of autism spectrum disorders asd in children who could then be given appropriate treatment much earlier in their lives asds mainly affect a person s social interaction and communication with symptoms that can include speech disturbances repetitive and or compulsive behaviour hyperactivity anxiety and difficulty adapting to new environments as there is a wide range of asd symptoms diagnosis can be difficult and uncertain particularly at the early stages of development it is estimated that about one in every people in the uk has asd with more boys diagnosed with the condition than girls scientists said their research found a link between asd and damage to proteins in blood plasma they found the most reliable of the tests they developed was examining protein in blood plasma which found children with asd had higher levels of the oxidation marker dityrosine dt and certain sugar modified compounds called advanced glycation end products ages genetic causes are thought to be responsible for about a third of cases of asd while the rest are believed to be caused by a combination of environmental factors mutations and rare genetic variants however researchers believe their new tests could reveal yet to be identified causes of asd they also confirmed the previously held belief that mutations of amino acid transporters are a genetic variant associated with asd the warwick team worked with collaborators at the university of bologna in italy who recruited children who had been diagnosed with asd along with a control group of other children between the ages of five and blood and urine samples were taken from the children for analysis the warwick team discovered there were chemical differences between the two groups working with a further collaborator at the university of birmingham the changes in multiple compounds were combined using artificial intelligence algorithm techniques to develop a mathematical equation to distinguish between asd and healthy controls the outcome was a diagnostic test better than any existing method they said the next steps were to repeat the study with further groups of children to confirm the good diagnostic performance and to assess if the test could identify asd at very early stages indicate how the asd is likely to develop further to more severe disease and assess if treatments were working the research was led by naila rabbani reader of experimental systems biology at the university of warwick who said our discovery could lead to earlier diagnosis and intervention we hope the tests will also reveal new causative factors with further testing we may reveal specific plasma and urinary profiles or fingerprints of compounds with damaging modifications this may help us improve the diagnosis of asd and point the way to new causes of asd the research has been published in the journal molecular autism note added february the uk autism research charity autistica provided the following comment to the guardian this is a small early stage study which may explain one biological difference in autism at this stage the results presented are not strong enough to suggest that this method could be used for the diagnosis of autism for example we don t know whether this technique can distinguish autism from adhd anxiety or other similar conditions there have been many previous attempts to develop a biological test for autism still the best way to diagnose autism is through clinical interview and observation which takes into account the many features of autism,0

remarkable that s how researchers are describing the results of a new study done on mice displaying traits associated with alzheimer s disease the deletion of just a single enzyme saw the near total reversal of the deposition of amyloid plaques found in brains of those with alzheimer s improving cognitive functions in the mouse subjects according to the study from researchers at the cleveland clinic published feb in the journal of experimental medicine these promising research findings center around deleting a gene that produces an enzyme called bace which helps make the beta amyloid peptides that accumulate abnormally in the brains of people with alzheimer s disease studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzyme s activity dramatically reduces production of beta amyloid peptides which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms including memory loss associated with alzheimer s by using bace inhibitors to gradually lower the enzyme s levels researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice offering hope for human subjects down the line according to the study cleveland clinic lerner research via journal of experimental medicine however researchers urge caution with the results as many alzheimer s discoveries seem to hold true in mice then fail in people cleveland clinic researcher riqiang yan ph d an author on the study told abc news that in the mouse model the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted completely stopping the enzyme s production but in humans it s unlikely that bace inhibitors would totally halt the enzyme s production yan said nonetheless five bace inhibitors are being tested in human subjects currently yan added bace inhibitors are still hopeful for ad patients if they have no unwanted side effects or can be tolerated for long term use yan said yan added researchers are currently in phase ii and in some cases phase iii clinical trials for the various compounds dr jay sheree allen is a family medicine resident physician at the mayo clinic in minnesota and a resident at the abc news medical unit,0
a japanese drug company is offering up a big claim shionogi co says it has an experimental pill that can kill the flu virus within a single day according to news reports in a clinical trial a single dose of the drug made by the pharmaceutical company eliminated the virus from people s bodies in a median time of hours the wall street journal reported both japanese and american flu patients were included in the trial the experimental drug worked three times faster than another antiviral drug tamiflu the company told the journal the drug uses a different approach to fight the flu than other medications the flu virus spreads through the body by invading cells once inside a cell it hijacks the cell s machinery forcing the cell to make copies of the virus then the newly copied viruses break out of the cell spreading to other cells nearby and repeating the process this flu season could be worst in a decade existing drugs including tamiflu work to block these viral copies from escaping the cell the journal reported the experimental drug however kicks into action earlier working to block the virus from hijacking cells in the first place the journal said japanese drug regulators could approve the drug for use in japan by early march the journal reported the drugmaker plans to apply for approval in the u s this summer however the drug likely wouldn t be available here until next year read more at the wall street journal originally published on live science,1
researchers have developed an ultraviolet uv lamp that kills the influenza virus but isn t harmful to human skin or eyes according to a new study in scientific reports they hope the technology can be commercialized and marketed to prevent the spread of seasonal flu in public places such as schools hospitals and airports we ve known for a century that uv light is extremely efficient at killing microbes bacteria and viruses says study leader david brenner director of the center for radiological research at columbia university irving medical center for that reason uv devices are often used for sterilization for medical equipment in hospitals for example or drinking water for backcountry campers but conventional germicidal lamps aren t safe for humans to be around with prolonged exposure they can cause skin cancer and cataracts in the eyes so up until now they re only really practical when people aren t around say brenner you can sterilize a hospital room but not when anyone s inside about five years ago brenner says the columbia team came up with a potential solution light on the far end of the uv c spectrum known as far uvc has very short wavelengths the researchers suspected that it can penetrate and destroy microscopic bacteria and viruses but can t travel through the protective outer layers of human skin or eyes we wanted to get all the benefits of uv light in terms of killing microbes but none of the health hazards says brenner earlier studies on animals and humans have shown that exposure to far uvc light does indeed appear to be safe we haven t seen any biological damage to skin cells or eye cells whereas with conventional uv light we ve always seen lots of biological damage he says previous research has also shown that far uvc light can kill mrsa bacteria a common cause of infections after surgery now brenner and his colleagues have show that uvc light can effectively kill airborne influenza in their new study aerosolized particles of the h n seasonal flu virus were released into a test chamber and exposed to very low doses of far uvc light the light inactivated the viruses with about the same efficiency as conventional germicidal uv light while a control group of bacteria not exposed to light remained active we think that this type of overhead light could be efficacious for basically any public setting says brenner think about doctor s waiting rooms schools airports and airplanes any place where there s a likelihood for airborne viruses and unlike the flu vaccine he says far uvc light is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes including newly emerging virus strains brenner says his team is working with a company to develop a commercially available version of the lamp which could become a cost effective way to battle flu epidemics on a population level the lamp we re using at the moment costs less than and you can imagine that if it were put into general circulation the price would drop dramatically he says

implications in clinical settings as well in the operating room during surgeries for example no matter how well you sterilize a room beforehand the medical staff can still bring in dangerous bacteria like mrsa says brenner if you have a lamp over the surgical site that can sterilize the air you can prevent the bacteria from floating down and contaminating the wound brenner can t predict how long it might take for these lamps to be commercially available but he says he s extremely optimistic about the technology there has been no way of killing viruses in the air in public spaces and this is

en español monday feb healthday news as a particularly nasty flu season rages across the united states scientists have found a powerful new disinfectant that makes light work of the virus researchers say a certain spectrum of ultraviolet light called far uvc easily kills airborne flu viruses while posing no risk to people it could offer a new inexpensive way to eliminate airborne flu viruses in indoor public spaces such as hospitals doctors offices schools airports and aircraft said the team from columbia university medical center in new york city the disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed said lead research david brenner but he believes the use of overhead low level far uvc light in public locations would be a safe and efficient method for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne mediated microbial diseases such as influenza and tuberculosis as the researchers explained broad spectrum uvc light kills viruses and bacteria and it is currently used to decontaminate surgical equipment but this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts so it s not used in public spaces however brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light far uvc might be a safer option in prior studies they found that far uvc light killed methicillin resistant s aureus mrsa bacteria a common and dangerous superbug without harming human or mouse skin in this new study they found that far uvc light also killed airborne h n virus a common strain of flu virus far uvc light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye so it s not a human health hazard said brenner who directs columbia s center for radiological research however because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells far uvc light can reach their dna and kill them he said in a university news release lamps with this type of uv light currently cost less than brenner said but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass produced and unlike flu vaccines far uvc is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes even newly emerging strains he said two flu experts were encouraged by the findings the prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far uv radiation is very exciting said dr michael grosso chief medical officer at huntington hospital in huntington n y though hand washing remains critically important it does not prevent every instance of transmission grosso said immunization and antiviral medications are also important but again have limitations it appears that low dose far uv light is safe and effective and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease causing viruses dr len horovitz a pulmonary specialist at lenox hill hospital in new york city agreed he noted that the technology s cost is not prohibitive and it is safe this use can sterilize the air in a public space reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses the findings were published online feb in the journal scientific reports more information the u s centers for disease control and prevention has more on flu,1
en español by amy norton healthday reporter tuesday jan healthday news stimulating the brain with an implantable device may be safe and possibly helpful for some people with alzheimer s disease a small pilot study suggests in what researchers described as a proof of concept treatment three alzheimer s patients had deep brain stimulation dbs wires implanted in the brain in areas related to skills like planning judgment and problem solving over the next months or more the tactic appeared to be safe and there were signals that it was slowing down two of the patients decline said lead researcher dr douglas scharre director of cognitive neurology at ohio state university s wexner medical center deep brain stimulation is already used to treat some cases of parkinson s disease and certain other brain disorders but it s far too early to know whether it has value for people with alzheimer s scharre stressed this is not ready for prime time he said it s not something patients can ask their neurologist for keith fargo who directs scientific programs and outreach for the alzheimer s association agreed it s much too early for patients or caregivers to seek out dbs said fargo who was not involved in the study instead he said these findings suggest that deep brain stimulation is a reasonable route to study in larger clinical trials the results were published online jan in the journal of alzheimer s disease deep brain stimulation involves implanting electrodes in the brain then connecting them to a pulse generator placed under the skin of the chest sometimes called a brain pacemaker it delivers electrical pulses that alter the activity in specific brain circuits the theory behind trying dbs for alzheimer s patients scharre said is similar to the use it or lose it principle if key brain areas can be stimulated to form new connections among cells it might slow decline right now scharre noted medications for alzheimer s target brain chemicals involved in memory but alzheimer s impairs all kinds of mental functions including judgment planning and decision making and those issues have a huge impact on daily life for patients and their caregivers scharre added so the patients in his study received dbs for at least months to brain areas that regulate those mental skills all three patients were in the earlier stages of alzheimer s and were on standard medications after starting dbs all saw a general decline in their memory problem solving and other skills but they declined at a slower rate compared to similar patients whose information was taken from an alzheimer s research database two of the dbs patients declined at a meaningfully slower rate according to scharre that included one who actually showed some improvements that patient was lavonne moore of delaware ohio when she entered the study she was not preparing any meals after two years of deep brain stimulation she d regained that skill and was better able to perform some other simple tasks like selecting her clothes and organizing outings in a ohio state news release her husband tom moore said her alzheimer s has progressed but more slowly than he d expected lavonne has had alzheimer s disease longer than anybody i know and that sounds negative but it s really a positive thing because it shows that we re doing something right moore said if dbs ever becomes an option for alzheimer s scharre said it would not be for everyone it would not be appropriate for example for people who are frail or have other serious medical conditions in the pilot study side effects included hot flashes heart palpitations and burning sensations in the skin which were reversed by adjusting the dbs settings the researchers said there is no larger trial in the works yet according to scharre what s needed said fargo is research that compares deep brain stimulation against a placebo device on a broader level he noted this study highlights an important point alzheimer s disease is more than just amnesia for caregivers fargo said the problems with abilities like judgment and planning can actually be more challenging so any new therapies that help address those issues would be welcome more than million americans have alzheimer s a number that could rise to million by according to the alzheimer s association more information the alzheimer s association offers resources for caregivers,1
many of these patients find themselves stuck with depression cognitive problems headaches fatigue and other symptoms known as post concussion syndrome this phenomenon is often difficult to treat antidepressants can lift moods painkillers can ease headaches and physical therapy may ease dizziness but most researchers agree that these remedies don t heal the injury within the brain could oxygen do the trick a growing group of scientists and physicians say that hyperbaric treatment which exposes patients to pure oxygen at higher than normal air pressure may work ad ad these patients don t have enough oxygen to heal the injured parts of their brains said shai efrati a researcher and physician at tel aviv university in israel and a leading hyperbaric scientist hyperbaric treatment massively increases the amount of oxygen available to the brain but other researchers believe that the treatment has no merit and should not be recommended people want to believe that hyperbaric can fix brain injuries and it can t said david cifu a researcher at virginia commonwealth university in richmond who has spent much of his career treating veterans with brain injuries compressed air has been used by doctors since the th century in two german inventors first used pressurized pure oxygen to treat decompression sickness which occurs when undersea divers return to the surface too quickly for the past years hyperbaric therapy has been approved by the food and drug administration as a treatment for non healing wounds carbon monoxide poisoning burns and decompression sickness over the past decade doctors in the united states and internationally have begun using it to treat mtbis ad ad mtbis include sports related concussions and head injuries caused by traffic accidents also between and american service members suffered mild traumatic brain injuries according to the department of defense patients with an mtbi typically experience symptoms that include headache dizziness fatigue depression anxiety and cognitive impairment known as post concussion syndrome pcs this phenomenon is difficult to treat doctors use antidepressants pain medications biofeedback and physical therapy but these strategies do not always work the nature of the human brain makes it particularly susceptible to chronic injury the organ requires large amounts of energy under normal circumstances and even more to heal when injured and often the initial trauma damages blood vessels that supply the brain with oxygen so just as the brain needs extra resources it faces an energy crisis often efrati and others say injured brain cells don t die but may persist for years or decades alive but hobbled hyperbaric therapy he said can return them to full function even years after the injury ad ad oxygen is different because it has a direct biological effect on brain tissue said paul g harch a physician in new orleans who over the past three decades has used hyperbaric oxygen to treat hundreds of people with chronic brain injury as well as stroke patients typically receive between and hour long hyperbaric treatments spread over two to three months during each treatment they sit or lie inside a hyperbaric chamber which varies in size from a person size tube to a large room that can hold several patients while in the chamber patients breathe in pure oxygen typically pressurized to about twice the density of sea level air in this environment the lungs take in about times as much oxygen as under normal conditions researchers say it remains unclear how hyperbaric oxygen affects injured brains efrati and others argue that it probably works through several biological pathways the extra oxygen appears to trigger the healing of brain cells and switches on genes specifically related to brain repair it increases the number of stem cells that migrate to sites of brain injury promotes the growth of new blood vessels in the brain and boosts the activity of mitochondria which provide energy to cells throughout the body scientists have linked increased mitochondrial activity to healing in many kinds of tissue ad ad efrati said the brain is no different from any other part of the body pressurized oxygen has the power to repair many kinds of tissue damage a non healing wound in the leg and a non healing wound in the brain he said they are the same basic thing efrati came to the field accidentally eight years ago as director of research at assaf harofeh medical center in tel aviv he was asked to oversee the hospital s small hyperbaric chamber he knew little about hyperbaric medicine and wasn t especially interested in it but he soon noticed that pressurized oxygen seemed to have an unexpected effect a patient had come for treatment of foot wounds that wouldn t heal a common symptom in diabetes the man had also suffered a traumatic brain injury several years earlier which left him unable to speak more than a few words the hyperbaric treatment healed his feet and also revived his ability to speak other patients with wounds and brain injuries had similar surprising results he began to examine how hyperbaric treatment affects the brain and this work has become his focus in efrati founded and now directs the sagol center for hyperbaric medicine and research at tel aviv university and assaf harofeh where he oversees and collaborates with a range of scientists and manages a large hyperbaric treatment facility as the use of hyperbaric therapy for brain injury has grown it has become increasingly controversial critics argue that it remains unproven and that desperate patients are wasting thousands of dollars the treatment typically costs between and per session and is rarely covered by insurance on a technique that rarely if ever helps between and cifu oversaw three studies for the department of veterans affairs reportedly at a taxpayer cost of about million of about active duty service members with post concussion syndrome the studies found that hyperbaric treatment had little effect on their symptoms ad ad overall there is relatively little research on hyperbaric treatment for brain injury in part because pressurized oxygen can t be patented which limits its potential profitability it s very difficult to get funding for studies on this topic harch said a few studies besides cifu s have looked at humans in a paper published in october efrati and colleagues examined post concussion syndrome patients who had received hyperbaric treatment using brain imaging the scientists found that after treatment the subjects had increased cerebral blood flow as well as more activity in brain areas that had previously been dormant they say that this indicates that hyperbaric treatment triggered regeneration of nerve fibers and blood vessels in the brain in addition tests showed that the subjects had improved memory and processing speed in another study published in researchers gave hyperbaric oxygen to patients with prolonged post concussion syndrome they found that many patients showed significant improvements in cognitive function and overall quality of life while the research remains inconclusive some american doctors are using oxygen to treat chronic brain injuries ad ad ziad mirza is one of them for most of his career he dispensed hyperbaric treatment for hospitals around baltimore two years ago he became chief medical officer for hyperheal hyperbarics a company with three clinics in the baltimore area since then he said he has treated about a half dozen brain injury patients with mostly positive results one of these patients is parisa cook who in was found to have a tennis ball size tumor in her brain surgeons removed it but the operation was not a complete success cook who lives in baltimore began to suffer from debilitating symptoms she had problems with her short term memory she had constant headaches and couldn t concentrate her vision became blurry and dark and her hearing was altered so that all sounds were jumbled and very loud specialists told her the operation probably had caused collateral brain trauma over the course of a year she went to eight doctors and tried more than a dozen medications and a variety of other treatments nothing helped a policy analyst for the maryland department of health she worried that she would have to quit her job she began to consider suicide i felt completely hopeless she said ad ad then cook read about hyperbaric oxygen treatment she got in touch with mirza and began treatments after a single session she said her vision was no longer wobbly after sessions over a month she felt perfect it was a complete she said this treatment saved my life cook s primary care doctor sujay pathak an internist in baltimore first saw her in february her life was totally interrupted by this she couldn t function pathak said but a few weeks after starting hyperbaric therapy in september she got suddenly and rather miraculously better pathak said of course such anecdotes are not the same as rigorous scientific research efrati agreed that hyperbaric treatment requires more research definitely we need more science he said we have a lot to learn but we are seeing the results with our patients it works again and again and again ad,1
many more stroke victims than previously thought can be saved from disability or death if doctors remove blood clots that are choking off circulation to the brain a new study has shown these striking results will have an immediate impact and save people from lifelong disability or death dr walter j koroshetz director of the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke said in a statement i really cannot overstate the size of this effect the key finding is that there is often more time than doctors realized in which brain cells can still be rescued by a procedure to remove the clot traditional guidelines have set a limit of six hours after stroke symptoms begin and said after that it would be too late to help the study showed that the time window could be expanded to hours however the findings do not apply to every stroke victim the researchers used a special type of brain imaging to identify the patients who still had live brain tissue that could be saved if the blood supply was restored only about half the patients who were screened qualified for treatment known as thrombectomy which uses a mechanical device to pull clots out of a blood vessel,1

en español by dennis thompson healthday reporter thursday jan healthday news injecting a calcium based cement into the bones of some people with knee or hip pain could help them avoid joint replacement surgery ohio state university doctors say the calcium phosphate cement flows into the spongy inside portion of the bone filling in microfractures and other damaged areas and it hardens in about minutes time said dr kelton vasileff an orthopedic surgeon at the university s wexner medical center the cement braces the bruised or injured joint bone from the inside vasileff explained and eventually is replaced by new bone as part of the body s natural healing process the procedure called subchondroplasty has been available to people with knee problems for years vasileff said now he and his colleagues are testing to see whether hip patients also can benefit from it it is much less invasive than a knee or hip replacement and typically is performed on an outpatient basis vasileff said the procedure involves a smaller incision than joint replacement surgery so there s less risk of infection and a quicker recovery time that means fewer of the side effects associated with being bedridden vasileff said however subchondroplasty is only feasible in a narrow range of patients those with full blown bone on bone arthritis or joint pain caused by damage to the cartilage and ligaments will get little to no relief from the procedure vasileff said people who have significant arthritis where the cartilage itself is damaged and thinned this isn t going to fix the arthritis vasileff said but there are some people who may have some issues with the bone and mild arthritis in these patients who might otherwise have needed a knee or hip replacement to deal with that this could be an alternative software engineer ben wallace underwent subchondroplasty in november to help shore up a damaged hip the end of september i noticed i was really struggling to move around my left leg very well said wallace who lives in columbus ohio imaging scans revealed a hip in very bad shape with a misshapen femur a five hour surgery cleaned up the femur and bolstered the bone with cement it s been going really great i m better than what they expected one week after surgery i was off the crutches walking on my own wallace said i figured i m going to have a fake hip in there at the age of which was very depressing wallace explained the fact i was able to keep all my bones and joints in there was quite a surprise subchondroplasty has shown solid potential but orthopedic surgeon dr matthew hepinstall is concerned that it might be oversold to desperate patients who want to avoid joint replacement surgery the claims that are being made are not evidence based yet although they are intellectually appealing said hepinstall he is associate director of the center for joint preservation reconstruction at lenox hill hospital in new york city it s just important not to oversell this he added the best candidates for the procedure are patients who still have some cartilage protecting their joint but have somehow overloaded and injured the bone causing swelling and pain hepinstall said if you inject this substance into the bone you re basically providing internal support a scaffold protecting the bone that can theoretically reduce bone pain hepinstall noted the appealing thing about it is instead of going in and resurfacing a damaged joint you re injecting something to help the bone but keeping the patient s own anatomy hepinstall continued but there s a very narrow window of patients who are good ideal candidates for this who basically have a real overload of their bone causing severe enough pain to warrant a surgical procedure but also have healthy enough cartilage that doing something about the bone swelling is going to alleviate the majority of their pain he stressed we don t want to send the message to people who have bone on bone with big bone spurs and limited range of motion that they re all of a sudden going to get relief from injecting a little bit of cement into their bone hepinstall said this is for people who have basically a normal joint that has normal range of motion and normal stability just a little thinning of the cartilage more information for more on knee pain visit the arthritis foundation,0

scientists and health professionals gush about the benefits of exercise in study after study and new research from the american academy of neurology is no exception the organization updated its guidelines for those with mild cognitive impairment wednesday and published them online in neurology the condition which people develop as they age involves issues with thinking and memory it affects more than percent of people in their s and it increases to percent for those age and older among the guidelines doctors should tell people with mild cognitive impairment to exercise consistently as six month studies have indicated exercising twice a week could improve memory medical professionals can suggest cognitive training for people though the evidence isn t strong that this could be beneficial for improvement mild cognitive impairment should not be confused with dementia mild cognitive impairment comes with milder symptoms though evidence has shown it can escalate to that point those with dementia may have trouble with daily tasks like getting dressed and making meals but with mild cognitive impairment people tend to have more difficulty than others their age remembering things like appointments or where they keep their car keys the los angeles times reports the guidelines note that no food and drug administration approved medications exist for mild cognitive impairment treatment nor are high quality long term studies in the works that imply drugs or dietary changes could aid people who have the condition,1
it s no secret that many people with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder may gravitate towards cigarette smoking many experts indicate that there is an association between people with the disorder and the desire to light up dr jeffrey newcorn professor of psychiatry and director of the division of adhd and learning disorders at the icahn school of medicine at mount sinai says that there is indeed a relationship between adhd and smoking people with adhd are at somewhat of an increased risk to abuse drugs he says adding that the drug they re more likely to resort to is nicotine because of its role in modulating the neurotransmission of dopamine in the brain people with adhd don t produce as much dopamine a neurotransmitter linked to the ability to regulate emotional response as someone without the disorder dopamine is also associated with feelings of reward and pleasure research has found a connection between adhd symptoms and lowered dopamine levels or issues with the efficiency of the brain s dopamine receptors newcorn explains that through the years there have also been some schools of thought that people with adhd have a harder time quitting the habit this ultimately drove researchers to think about developing a nonstimulant alternative in the form of a drug that safely mimics the effects of nicotine however he says that this hasn t yet panned out instead what has gained more attention newcorn says is research about any possible roles adhd stimulant medications may play in helping someone with the disorder quit or at least reduce nicotine use there has been and continues to be a lot of interest in this area newcorn says more about smoking less not stopping completely according to scott h kollins professor and vice chair for research in the department of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the duke university school of medicine there isn t a concrete yes or no to the question of whether adhd stimulants can help an adhd person quit in fact he says that rather than this being an issue of quitting the habit altogether it appears that the focus is more about adhd stimulants role in possibly lessening the number of cigarettes smoked in fact kollins was involved in a study published in the journal of attention disorders that touched on this very subject the journal states that our findings suggest that among adult regular smokers with adhd who are interested in quitting ldx does not increase the probability of smoking cessation more than does placebo but is associated with a significant overall reduction in the amount of cigarettes smoked and is effective for reducing adhd symptoms ldx stands for lisdexamfetamine dimesylate an adhd stimulant more commonly known by the brand name vyvanse in this and other related research kollins has been involved with he says that overall stimulants don t necessarily help people with adhd quit smoking people don t really improve any greater than with a placebo however he states that the people taking adhd stimulants smoked less compared to those taking a placebo kollins also points out that this study yielded results comparable other research on the topic in fact the ldx study notes that findings from this study are consistent with another published trial of osmotic release methylphenidate in adult smokers with adhd which reported no effects of the stimulant drug on smoking cessation outcomes but reductions in cigarettes smoked day and significant drug placebo differences in adhd symptoms across the study winhusen et al concerta is an example of an osmotic release methylphenidate all of this begs the question what is it about adhd stimulant medication that may produce this effect kollins explains that stimulants do similar things from a pharmacologic perspective as nicotine suggesting that taking such medication may replace the urge to light up as frequently treatment with stimulants may put the urge to smoke in check more he speculates the road ahead such research isn t to say that taking adhd stimulants will automatically make a person with the disorder ease up on their habit you certainly couldn t say that stimulants could be used for smoking cessation in people with adhd newcorn says on the other hand stimulants are an appropriate treatment for people with adhd whether they smoke or not he explains that currently thinking about stimulants in terms of helping people with adhd with smoking cessation means talking about something off label in other words not for intended use despite the fact that certain positive outcomes may arise by taking it but newcorn adds that there may be reasonable strategies such as limiting a medication to a specific group of people and within a specific class of medication for example he explains that wellbutrin an antidepressant and zyban a drug to help a person stop smoking are the same drug but they are marketed for different things many studies show that wellbutrin could have a positive effect for people with adhd he says making the point that sorting through such labeling and marketing intricacies could play a role in further exploration on the topic,1
could a zap to the brain derail destructive impulses enlarge this image marco jeurissen collection mix sub getty images marco jeurissen collection mix sub getty images picture this while reaching for the cookie jar or cigarette or bottle of booze or other temptation a sudden slap denies your outstretched hand when the urge returns out comes another slap now imagine those slaps occurring inside the brain protecting you in moments of weakness in a report published monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences stanford neuroscientists say they ve achieved this sort of mind reading in binge eating mice they found a telltale pattern of brain activity that comes up seconds before the animals start to pig out and delivering a quick zap to that part of the brain kept the mice from overindulging whether this strategy could block harmful impulses in people remains unclear for now the path seems promising the current study used a brain stimulation device already approved for hard to treat epilepsy and based on the new findings a clinical trial testing this off the shelf system for some forms of obesity could start as early as next summer says casey halpern the study s leader and an assistant professor of neurosurgery at stanford he thinks the approach could also work for eating disorders and a range of other addictive or potentially life threatening urges as a physician researcher halpern specializes in deep brain stimulation dbs a surgical treatment in which battery powered implants send electrical pulses to brain areas where signals go awry the food and drug administration has approved dbs therapy for movement disorders such as parkinson s disease tremor and dystonia usually in people who haven t responded well to medications occasionally dbs is a last resort treatment for obsessive compulsive disorder ocd another study published monday in pnas suggests that dbs could help boost memory and other research is exploring its use for substance abuse and other reward seeking behaviors years ago the stanford team developed a mouse model to test if dbs could curb overeating granted mice don t normally gorge themselves yet if offered fattier tastier chow each day for just an hour within days the mice realize if they don t eat this now that guy s coming back to take it away halpern says so the animals learn to binge but when the researchers applied dbs stimulation to a part of the brain s reward circuit known as the nucleus accumbens the mice quit stuffing themselves trouble is the moderation wore off in a few days and the dbs also interfered with the animals social behavior that got halpern thinking about a newer system one that doesn t stimulate continuously like dbs but switches on briefly only after sensing a trouble signal much like a pacemaker monitors and responds to abnormal heart rhythms in the fda approved a newer generation device known as a responsive neurostimulation system rns that does just that implanted within the brain it senses early epileptic seizures and slows their spread with small zaps to the onset area the rns system costs around but with medical devices halpern says hospitals pay for the hardware and insurance companies often cover the surgery if clinical trial data are good and the treatment is fda approved in the current study halpern and coworkers tested the rns device in the binging mice first they looked for a biomarker an electrical blip that appears in the brain just before the animal reaches for fatty food next the researchers programmed the stimulator to deliver a second pulse whenever it detects this biomarker they rigged some mice to this intermittent stimulator for comparison other animals got continuous dbs stimulation or random pulses the intermittent system controlled overeating much better than the continuous or random protocols and nearly as well as in a separate group of mice that got zapped manually by a researcher watching their behavior on video plus the treatment seemed specific to the food addiction it did not affect anticipation associated with normal behaviors such as meeting a new mouse the results point to a real time biomarker for impulsive behavior says dennis turner a duke university neurosurgeon who was not involved in the study but wrote an october review about ongoing research on a range of potential brain stimulation biomarkers that s the clear novelty figuring out if this biomarker would also work in people is challenging few are willing to undergo brain surgery for the purpose of research but halpern had a rare opportunity one of his patients developed ocd so debilitating that he opted for dbs he agreed to have his brain recorded during the surgery since food isn t allowed in the operating room the researchers monitored the patient s brain as he anticipated payoffs in a computerized money making task as reported in the pnas paper the characteristic anticipatory signal appeared when he expected to make but not for smaller sums suggesting some level of specificity of course it s hard to conclude much from a single subject but from other research we know it s safe to place an electrode in the nucleus accumbens it s safe to stimulate it electrically and we expect to be able to tune the electrode as we already do with dbs so it seems like a nice opportunity says halpern noting that addictive disorders haven t had new therapies for decades i m motivated by the clinical need esther landhuis is a freelance science journalist in the san francisco bay area follow her at elandhuis,1
the spread of some sexually transmitted infections could potentially be dramatically reduced by instructing people who have had unprotected sex to take antibiotics within hours after the intercourse a new study suggests but such a strategy which was tested in a population of men who had frequent unprotected sex with a number of male sex partners could spark a controversy over the use of antibiotics and the general threat of growing antibiotic resistance my message with that study would be that we need to do more research to prevent stis because that s a concern and this strategy could potentially be used said dr jean michel molina head of infectious diseases at saint louis hospital in paris and the lead author of the study advertisement molina insisted he would never support long term use of antibiotics to prevent stis but said that the approach might be an effective short term strategy when paired with other control approaches like more frequent sti testing among high risk populations i don t want this strategy to be used widely in any person clearly molina said but if you can select a group with a high incidence rate of syphilis or chlamydia and you want to try to reduce the rate of syphilis quite quickly in this group of people you may think that this strategy could be used for a couple of months newsletters sign up for morning rounds your daily dose of news in health and medicine please enter a valid email address privacy policy leave this field empty if you re human rates of syphilis in particular have risen steadily in recent years the rate in cases per people was the highest since the centers for disease control and prevention reported the rate of infection increased in every age group over the age of in both men and women and in all ethnic groups molina s study was recently published by the journal lancet infectious diseases the bill and melinda gates foundation was one of its funders the researchers randomly assigned men to one of two groups one of the groups was given antibiotics the drug doxycycline to take if they had unprotected sex they were told to take two pills per encounter and no more than six in a week ideally within hours and no later than hours after the intercourse in reality the median use among the men was about pills per month the men were tested regularly for stis and in the nine or so months they were followed the rates of some sexually transmitted infections fell dramatically in the treatment group the overall reduction of all stis was percent but that average was dragged down by the fact that doxycycline doesn t cure gonorrhea there was however a percent reduction in chlamydia infections and cases of syphilis decreased by percent the authors noted however that the study length was short and they can t tell if the strategy would work as well over the long term the results can t be taken in isolation others experts warned using doxycycline this way could drive the bacteria that cause the infections to develop resistance to the drug warned dr brad spellberg an infectious diseases specialist and chief medical officer at the los angeles county university of southern california medical center in los angeles spellberg also said people who used the drug this way would be exposing the bacteria they have in their gastro intestinal tracts their own gut flora to regular doses of doxycycline and those bacteria too could develop resistance to the drug leading to a host of other health problems you re causing friendly fire injury he said the full picture of the knock on effects of exposing your gut flora to antibiotics is still coming into focus said ramanan laxminarayan director of the center for disease dynamics economics and policy and a leading voice on the dangers of mounting antibiotic resistance he noted a recent report in the journal science revealed that some cancer immunotherapy drugs worked less well in people who had recently taken antibiotics molina noted that antibiotic resistance to doxycycline has not been seen in chlamydia or syphilis despite the fact that the drug has been used to treat these infections for decades still he said the possibility it could arise cannot be discounted a commentary published with the study argued that reducing infection rates in men who have sex with men and who are highly sexually active might lower sti infection rates more generally in a community authors christopher fairley and eric chow of australia s melbourne sexual health center at monash university said pressure from patients to be given doxycycline on a preventative basis might be substantial given that the drug is also prescribed in six month courses to treat acne like molina and his co authors they said sti preventive use at this point is premature laxminarayan did not dismiss the notion of this type of use out of hand however i certainly think that for a small subset of the population if this helps prevent syphilis then it certainly is worth exploring further he said but he said additional studies should be conducted first to try to get a better picture of the potential consequences of using doxycycline this way including the risk of resistance developing the potential that it might further erode condom use and any other unintended consequences,1
i think this may be changing in health care said spears but because migraine affects women more than men there is a stigma around the stereotype of a patient who comes in with multiple complaints calls frequently and wants to see the doctor frequently men on the other hand have been stereotyped as going to the doctor only when something he has is real,1

type diabetes is a chronic condition that affects million people worldwide for decades doctors have treated it with medications designed to keep blood sugar levels down but in a paper published in the lancet researchers in the uk describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission just by losing weight nearly half of people in the study who were given a six month diet plan and lost an average of pounds went into remission and no longer had diabetes none took any medications during that time to control their disease and relied on weight loss alone health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now type diabetes is caused by the body s in ability to break down sugars from the diet normally cells in the pancreas work to release insulin a hormone that can process sugar and either send it to cells that need it for energy or store it as fat for future energy needs cells in the liver are responsible for clearing insulin from the circulation but excess fat in the pancreas and liver can start to shut down these insulin producing cells leading to spikes in blood sugar levels diabetes medications can bring sugar levels down but do not address the compromised insulin machinery in the study dr roy taylor professor of medicine and metabolism at newcastle university and his colleagues randomly assigned nearly people to either a weight management program or their usual treatments including diabetes medications all of the people had been diagnosed with type diabetes in the six years preceding the study the people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet the diet which was designed to help people lose up to pounds involved three to five months of a strict low calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than calories a day followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan taylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver after a year most of the people in the diet group lost about pounds compared to two pounds in the control group nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose pounds or more while none in the control group were able to lose that much most importantly of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes compared to just in the control group more antibiotics are linked to type diabetes people newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn t necessarily for life says taylor it isn t an irreversible inexorable condition that you can never escape from at the moment people are told that previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes including diet and exercise can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes the diabetes prevention program in the u s revealed in that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre diabetes to diabetes in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar gastric bypass surgery which can result in dramatic weight loss can also help to reverse diabetes but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications the current study takes that work a step further and shows that it s possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently within the past six years and that the effect may not apply to more long term patients that s because as the disease continues he says insulin producing cells start to die off initially the cells slowly shut down entering a so called resting state those are the cells that weight loss can re activate get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you

years for example may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission that points to an important lesson that taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results he says that it s critical to discuss from the start when people are diagnosed with diabetes the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease if more people can benefit from losing weight alone then that would mean less cost to the health care system as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease which can include heart problems neuropathy vision issues and even amputations taylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight and if they are whether they continue to remain in remission from the very clear data we produced in this trial yes this is a watershed moment for diabetes he says we can offer people hope from the start contact us at,1
researchers say erenumab is incredibly important step forward for condition that affects million people in uk this article is more than year old this article is more than year old a new migraine drug that can halve the length of attacks has been hailed as the start of real change in how the condition is treated erenumab a laboratory made antibody that blocks a neural brain pathway called cgrp is the first drug in years proven to prevent migraine attacks phase three trial data on nearly patients showed that it typically cut between three and four migraine days per month in half the patients treated migraine duration was reduced at least by half migraines could be caused by gut bacteria study suggests read more migraines are characterised by an intense throbbing headache sensitivity to light and noise nausea vomiting low energy and visual disturbances attacks can last anything from four to hours each year more than million people in the uk are thought to experience migraine more than the number affected by asthma diabetes and epilepsy combined the condition is linked to depression and sick days caused by migraine are estimated to cost the uk economy more than bn per year the trial called strive compared patients taking erenumab for six months with others given a non active placebo dummy drug the research revealed that by months four to six at least a reduction in mean migraine days per month was achieved for just over of patients injected under the skin with mg of erenumab each month while half of patients injected with the higher dose of mg had such results however those given a placebo also saw benefits with of participants in this group experiencing such a reduction lead investigator prof peter goadsby from king s college hospital london said strive represents an incredibly important step forward for migraine understanding and migraine treatment the findings reported in the new england journal of medicine clearly showed that blocking the cgrp pathway could reduce the impact of migraine he said the results of strive represent a real transition for migraine patients from poorly understood re purposed treatments to a specific migraine designed therapy simon evans chief executive of the charity migraine action said migraine is too often trivialised as just a headache when in reality it can be a debilitating chronic condition that can destroy lives the effects can last for hours even days in many cases an option that can prevent migraine and that is well tolerated is therefore sorely needed and we hope that this marks the start of real change in how this condition is treated and perceived broadly speaking i think this is a very interesting study and i think it is a good step forward for the field and i think it is a good day for migraine sufferers said professor zameel cader director of the oxford headache centre who was not involved in the research pointing out that the results were on a par with currently available therapies for migraine placebo responses in migraine studies are quite high and i think that is partly due to the subjective nature of pain and because of the strong psychological effects that being treated have on that experience of pain and those symptoms he said adding that injections generally result in an even stronger placebo effect than tablets cader said that he too was looking at running trials using antibodies and said he was excited about the approach since it might result in fewer side effects than current therapies and would mean individuals would not have to remember to take a table every day this is probably the first example of a migraine preventing drug that was rationally designed rather than serendipitously found he added amgen and novartis the codevelopers of erenumab funded the trial while amgen also supplied the drug and conducted the data analyses,1
you don t have to break a sweat to reap the health benefits of physical activity according to new research in the journal of the american geriatrics society in a study of women age and older just minutes a day of light exercise like running errands and cleaning the house was linked to a lower risk of death moderate intensity exercise like leisurely bike riding or brisk walking was associated with an even greater reduction in risk the authors say that improving doing more light and moderate physical activity could be almost as effective as rigorous exercise at preventing disease and prolonging life the paradigm needs to shift when we think about being active says senior author andrea lacroix professor of family medicine and public health at the university of california san diego for the study lacroix and her colleagues asked women ages to to wear activity tracking accelerometers for seven days as they went about their daily activities the women were then followed for an average of three years health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now based on the data from the women s activity trackers the researchers found that those who got at least minutes of light physical activity a day were less likely to die compared to those who got less those who got an additional minutes of moderate activity were less likely to die light physical activity includes just about any type of behavior that isn t sitting down walking to the mailbox strolling around the neighborhood and doing laundry activities like these account for more than of older adults daily activity says lacroix so the fact that they were protective in this study is very good news we ve always been told that this type of activity isn t enough to do you good says lacroix but what we have here is solid evidence that light physical activity reduces a woman s risk of dying over the next three to four years and we see the benefits are substantial and independent of moderate to vigorous physical activity more time s guide to exercise the study could not show a cause and effect relationship between activity level and risk of death only an association but the link was present in all types of women in the study including those of all races and ethnicities women who were obese and those who were not women with high and low functional abilities and women older and younger than as adults get older they expend more energy doing the same activities they did when they were younger lacroix says so they don t need to exercise as much or as intensely to burn the same amount of calories or get their heart rate up we know that people of different ages need different amounts and intensities of exercise to get the same result she says it s not one size fits all but national guidelines still recommend that adults over age follow the same guidelines as younger people to get at least minutes of moderate to vigorous physical activity per week and recent analyses compiled from studies in which adults self reported their levels of physical activity have suggested that older adults have to log moderate to vigorous exercise

research and shows that older adults can still benefit at levels below the moderate to vigorous guidelines questionnaires used in self reported studies don t do a good job of encompassing all the ways people get physical activity throughout the day she says which may have skewed previous study results what makes our study stronger than those others is that we used a device that was able to measure all of the movements we do in our daily lives she says the researchers hope their work sparks more discussion about how people especially older ones think about exercise and their goals for being active i think the current guidelines are discouraging to older people who don t believe they can do minutes of hard exercise lacroix says they throw up their hands and think that s not for me but

the american heart association has changed the definition of hypertension for the first time in years moving the number from the old standard of to the newly revised the change is outlined in the american heart association hypertension practice guidelines an extensive report by experts without relevant ties to the pharmaceutical industry the changes are expected to drastically impact adult americans revising the hypertension threshold downward will increase the percent of u s adults living with high blood pressure from percent to percent nearly half of the adult population it will also disproportionately affect younger people by tripling the number of men under and doubling the number of women under with the diagnosis american heart association the new guidelines reflect years of research which have shown that people within the new range of blood pressure defined as hypertension have doubled their risk of cardiovascular problems in the future such as heart attacks or strokes as such health care professionals should be identifying these patients and helping to initiate interventions to bring down blood pressure while the new guidelines significantly increase the number of americans with a diagnosis of hypertension they do not suggest a proportionate increase in treating with medication the number of americans with hypertension who are recommended for medical treatment would increase by only million adults or percent more than were previously recommended medication will be recommended for patients with previous cardiovascular events such as heart attack or significant cardiovascular risk factors determined by factors such as age blood tests and having other medical conditions that increase risk of heart attack the study authors recommend lifestyle changes including exercise diet modifications and weight loss as the first step to reducing high blood pressure getty images doctors in the guidelines stress the importance of using two separate blood pressure readings on two different occasions to diagnose hypertension they recommend that those with hypertension use approved blood pressure monitors at home writing down these readings at home can help tell the difference between people with truly abnormal blood pressure and those with white coat syndrome with high blood pressure only under stress like at the doctor s office high blood pressure increases the risk of cardiac problems and strokes and is sometimes called the silent killer because so many adults live with high blood pressure and don t know it to help understand the new hypertension guidelines and how they affect managing your health see your healthcare professional,1
cnn the first large head to head comparison of two opioid addiction medications found that although they were equally effective in getting people off of high levels of opioids users had a significantly more difficult time starting a regimen of naltrexone compared with buprenorphine buprenorphine is commonly known by the the brand name suboxone and naltrexone is sold under the brand name vivitrol the study published tuesday in the lancet looked at patients with opioid addiction at eight inpatient treatment centers across the country for weeks half of the group was assigned to naltrexone and the other half to bupenorphine six percent of those enlisted to use buprenorphine were unable to start their treatment whereas of those assigned to naltrexone dropped out before starting the therapy that hurdle is attributed to the fact that in order to start naltrexone a person has to have detoxed or not used opioids for several days whereas a user can transition from opioids to buprenorphine seamlessly if you re currently opiate dependent naltrexone takes more work said dr joshua lee the lead author of the study who studies opioid addiction behavior and treatment at new york university once on either of the medications people fared equally well they tend to stay on medications about the same rate they report good outcomes avoiding heroin use lee said however both groups also reported similar challenges staying with the regimens just of patients still used the drugs after weeks what was important lee said was for opioid addicts as well as treatment providers to understand that addiction isn t one size fits all much like you would expect if the doctor told you you have cancer or you have diabetes then there are different ways you could pursue treatment he said the gold standard of addiction treatment public health experts consider medicated assisted treatment the gold standard of opioid addiction treatment it combines medication with counseling to help addicts wean off of high opioid use public health experts say it can help solve the staggering opioid overdose epidemic this year alone the cdc estimates that more than people have died of drug overdoses most of them from opioids more than the number of american troops lost during the entire vietnam war studies have found that using medicated assisted treatments can reduce overdose mortality by half methadone may be the best known form of medicated assisted treatment but it requires patients to have the drug administered daily in a clinic two other options have become increasingly popular buprenorphine which can be taken outside a clinic and naltrexone which is administered monthly naltrexone has become become an increasingly popular choice among drug courts some say that s because of the once a month administration and others say it s because it requires that users completely detox before starting the regimen understanding addiction people need choices said caleb banta green a professor at the university of washington s school of public health banta green who was not involved in the new study said that getting the right treatment means understanding addiction from a psychological as well as biological perspective legally prescribed opioid drugs like oxycodone and hydrocodone work in the same manner as illicit drugs like heroin they all chemically bind to the opioid receptors in the brain to help dull pain and in some people provide euphoria the body also produces natural opioids but the more narcotics a person takes the less opioids the body naturally produces without the opioids people can go into withdrawal all contributing to a cycle of dependency to feel normal they need opiates on those receptors banta green said buprenorphine and methadone which are opioids work by reducing people s cravings they bind to prevent withdrawal giving some opiate effect he said on the other hand naltrexone works by chemically blocking those receptors which is why someone needs to detox before starting the regimen you re not getting an opiate effect banta green explained if a person takes an opioid while on naltrexone it is unlikely they will feel any opioid sensation if a person is using opioids and takes naltrexone it can induce a feeling of withdrawal it addresses craving in a different way the person knows they can t use he said so for example a person who is actively using opioids and can t manage the withdrawals may be better suited for buprenorphine while someone coming from a facility where he or she has detoxed and who doesn t want to use opioids may be better suited for naltrexone follow cnn health on facebook and twitter see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter what is key said dr miriam komaromy is meeting a patient where they are and understanding what best meets their needs addiction is an incredibly deadly disease said komaromy an addiction specialist at the university of new mexico health sciences center and as public policymakers prisons and drug courts play a larger role in treating addiction public health experts like komaromy argue that it is imperative to look at evidence based ways instead of having a moralistic view banta green says he talks to a lot of judges who are trying to understand addiction treatment i say this a lot to judges you can t just offer one medication just like any other medication some people are going to feel right with one as opposed to the other,1

en español thursday oct healthday news blood thinners may pull double duty for people with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation new research suggests they help prevent dementia as well as stroke because atrial fibrillation increases the risk for stroke people with the condition are often prescribed blood thinners also known as anticoagulants to prevent blood clots that can cause a stroke atrial fibrillation also increases the risk for dementia during the study more than of the participants all with atrial fibrillation were diagnosed with dementia at the time they joined the study about half of the participants were taking oral anticoagulants such as warfarin eliquis apixaban pradaxa dabigatran savaysa edoxaban or xarelto rivaroxaban the researchers found that people taking anticoagulants were percent less likely to develop dementia than were those who were not taking the blood thinners when the researchers focused on people who continued to take the drugs they found an even larger reduction percent in the risk for dementia they also found that the sooner people started taking blood thinners after their diagnosis of atrial fibrillation the lower their risk for dementia along with not taking blood thinners the strongest predictors for dementia were age parkinson s disease and alcohol abuse according to the study published oct in the european heart journal the findings strongly suggest that blood thinners reduce the risk for dementia in people with atrial fibrillation but proving that would not be possible the swedish researchers said in order to prove this assumption randomized placebo controlled trials would be needed but such studies cannot be done because of ethical reasons researchers leif friberg and marten rosenqvist of the karolinska institute in stockholm said in a journal news release it is not possible to give placebo to atrial fibrillation patients and then wait for dementia or stroke to occur however the findings show that people with atrial fibrillation should start taking blood thinners as soon as possible after their diagnosis and continue to take the drugs friberg noted patients start on oral anticoagulation for stroke prevention but they stop after a few years at an alarmingly high rate he said in the first year approximately percent stop taking the drugs then approximately percent each year if you know that atrial fibrillation eats away your brain at a slow but steady pace and that you can prevent it by staying on treatment i think most patients would find this a very strong argument for continuing treatment he said more information the u s national heart lung and blood institute has more on atrial fibrillation,1

en español by karen pallarito healthday reporter monday oct healthday news drinking plenty of water each day may have an unexpected benefit staving off urinary tract infections a new study reports young women plagued by utis who drank an additional cups of water each day were nearly half percent as likely as a control group to have another infection the study showed the water group also reduced their use of antibiotics by roughly half or percent what s more the amount of time that passed before a woman s next uti and between recurrent infections was longer in the water group than in the control group women are more prone to utis than men partly due to their anatomy a shorter urethra makes it easier for bacteria from rectum to enter the vagina and travel to the bladder study author dr thomas hooton said it s thought that increasing fluid intake decreases uti risk in two ways by preventing bacteria from adhering to the bladder and by reducing the overall concentration of bacteria that could cause an infection flushing bacteria out of the bladder it s been known at least it s been thought that it is protective this study suggests that it is said hooton clinical director of the division of infectious diseases at the university of miami school of medicine dr hunter wessells who wasn t involved in the study called the additional fluid intake substantial leading to a corresponding increase in urine output it is the urine output which is of course the key factor leading to the effect seen in the study said wessells chair of the department of urology at the university of washington school of medicine in seattle dr susan bleasdale medical director of infection control at the university of illinois at chicago said the study may be a game changer for antibiotic stewardship programs aimed at reducing inappropriate antibiotic use she cited a review estimating that million to million women a year will suffer from a uti accounting for billion antibiotic prescriptions a year we might not even need to use antibiotics she said the study conducted in bulgaria involved healthy premenopausal women who had at least three utis in the past year all reported low daily fluid intake they drank roughly four cups of fluid per day including just cups of water a day half of the women in the study were asked to consume liters of water or about cups each day in addition to their usual daily fluid intake specifically they were asked to begin drinking a liter water bottle at each meal and finish each bottle before the next meal the remaining women served as a control group they continued their usual fluid intake the women were followed for a year with clinic visits at the beginning of the study as well as and months later researchers measured their water and fluid intake urine volume frequency and concentration and symptoms they also called the women each month to assess compliance and counsel them to return to the clinic for evaluation and possible treatment if they were experiencing uti symptoms overall the water group increased daily water intake by close to cups a day their total daily fluid intake including water and other beverages averaged nearly cups by contrast the control group s total daily fluid intake was less than half of that hooton noted that it s not clear exactly how much fluid intake must increase to deliver a benefit there s no magic in a liter and a half he said likewise he believes any increase in fluid not just water may be beneficial since fluids are mostly water and while the study involved younger women he said older women who experience recurrent utis may benefit from increasing their daily fluid intake as well whether the advice would benefit women with normal urine output however is unclear wessells noted in addition the bother associated with the higher urine output and feasibility of implementing this water intake strategy across a range of occupations and ages requires further study as well he said researchers presented the findings saturday at idweek the annual meeting of the infectious diseases society of america the society for healthcare epidemiology of america the hiv medicine association and the pediatric infectious diseases society research presented at meetings is generally considered preliminary until published in a peer reviewed publication more information visit the u s centers for disease control and prevention for more on utis,1
regular exercise may prevent many cases of future depression according to a new australian study and researchers say that as little as one hour a week can make a real difference the paper published in the american journal of psychiatry followed more than healthy norwegian adults without symptoms of anxiety or depression for an average of years asking them about their exercise habits and symptoms of depression and anxiety at the beginning and end of the study at the start about said they didn t exercise and the rest said they exercised anywhere from up to minutes to more than hours a week over the next decade about of people in the study developed depression and about developed anxiety no relationship was observed between exercise and later anxiety but the researchers did find a link between exercise and later depression health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now people who said they didn t exercise at the study s start were more likely to become depressed compared to those who exercised at least to hours a week for people who worked out more no additional benefits were observed the study could not prove a cause and effect relationship between exercise and the risk of depression but the authors say it strongly suggests one especially because they controlled for other potential factors including age gender social support smoking drinking and body mass index if their hypothesis is right they say of depression cases could be prevented if everyone got just one hour of exercise a week that exercise doesn t have to be intense either they say people seemed to have mental health benefits from physical activity regardless of whether they reported working out to the point of exhaustion or barely breaking a sweat more surprising benefits of exercise given that the intensity of exercise does not appear to be important the authors wrote in their paper it may be that the most effective public health measures are those that encourage and facilitate increased levels of everyday activities such as walking or cycling of course there are other benefits to more frequent and more intense bouts of exercise both the american heart association and the world health organization recommend getting at least minutes of moderate to high intensity physical activity a week for cardiovascular and overall health but when it comes to mental health benefits the majority of the protective effect comes from the first one or two hours of exercise each week said study author samuel harvey associate professor of workplace mental health at the black dog institute and the university of new south wales in an email more a new hope for depression the authors write that the combined physical and social benefits of exercise are likely responsible for its ability to help stave off depression it s also possible they add that exercise may trigger changes in self esteem the release of mood boosting endorphins and the production of certain proteins there is good evidence that physical activity can help people recover from depression though we recommend it be used in addition to the usual treatments we would prescribe for established depression like medication and counseling says harvey our study takes this a bit further and shows that exercise may also have a role in preventing people developing depression in the first place contact us at,1
a new genetic testing kit that hits the market today is the most affordable and arguably one of the simplest ways for women to find out if they have an increased risk of developing breast cancer here is what women should know about brca gene mutation testing including how it works who should actually consider getting it and the new convenient test that one woman already credits for helping detect her cancer early what are the brca genes the two brca genes brca and brca normally help protect women from cancer however some women may have mutations to their brca genes which can actually lead to cancer according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention if untreated women with a brca gene mutation are seven times more likely to get breast cancer and times more likely to get ovarian cancer before the age of when compared with women without the gene mutations according to the cdc should everyone take a brca gene test medical professionals say no the brca test is absolutely not recommended for every single person according to dr jennifer ashton abc news chief women s health correspondent she identified the criteria doctors want people to meet before being tested for brca including a family history of someone having a positive brca mutation ovarian cancer at any age in the family breast cancer before the age of triple negative breast cancer before the age of male breast cancer in the family at any age people of ashkenazi jewish ancestry people who have had two or more cases of breast cancer one occurring before the age of on their mother s or father s side of the family the u s preventive services task force uspstf recommends against routine brca gene testing for women who do not have a family history associated with an increased risk for potentially harmful mutations in the brca genes the group of preventative care experts wrote on their website the uspstf does however recommend that women who have family members with breast ovarian tubal or peritoneal cancer should receive genetic counseling and brca testing if recommended after counseling the color brca gene test color while the new color brca genetic mutation test is not the only brca genetic test on the market at it is currently the cheapest making gene testing more accessible to all women the color test must be ordered by a physician either through your own doctor or an independent physician through the company users are asked to send a saliva sample which carries your d n a to their lab where it is analyzed results are then sent back to the user online in three to four weeks dr valerie montgomery rice a women s health researcher at the morehouse school of medicine in atlanta georgia told abc news that one in eight women will get breast cancer in their lifetime so it s very important the women who are high risk we want them to have access to the test and many of us believe the price makes it more affordable montgomery rice said devon gant told abc news that she used the color test to find out that she tested positive for the brca gene mutation abc news it s kind of a black cloud gant said it s this thing that s kind of looming in the future gant said that although there were times when she struggled with the test results it s not a death sentence when her aunt lauren rossi took a color test and also got a positive result for a brca mutation doctors sent rossi for an mri she said abc news that s when they found a couple of spots said they didn t really think it was anything rossi told abc news and it came back that it was cancer rossi said that when she received the phone call she couldn t believe it in part due to the genetic test and the early detection rossi says she is now cancer free thank god she told abc news it would ve been a totally different outcome probably next february when i went for you know for my mammography she said that she is grateful that both she and gant were tested for the brca gene mutation because it helped doctors detect cancer in her and it empowers her niece with knowledge about her health now she knows rossi said of her niece and she knows what she needs to do and she ll stay healthy window into the future ashton describes genetic testing as showing a possible window into the future it doesn t mean a guarantee because we know that genes are just one part of what determines someone s future health risks she said behavior and environment are also important people should also be aware that it is possible now to test for over gene mutations associated with different types of hereditary cancer according to ashton eight of those gene mutations are associated with breast cancer while all the attention goes on brca it is important for people to know they can have a gene mutation in other genes and it is readily available now to test for this she said this is a mainstream option which i think is good news for some people,1
is it time for you to begin screening for colorectal cancer screening looks for signs of cancer in someone who doesn t have any symptoms the idea is that by catching cancer early before it spreads it s easier to treat stool screening tests one way to look for signs of colorectal cancer is to see if there are microscopic amounts of blood in the stool using a high sensitivity fecal occult blood test or fobt occult in this case means hidden it s an indirect indicator the patient could be harboring polyps precancerous growths in the colon says dr sreeram maddipatla medical oncologist hematologist for the liver center and pancreas center at uf health cancer center orlando health although blood in the stool can mean there s a tumor or polyps it can also be a sign of something much less serious like hemorrhoids the u s food and drug administration has approved two types of fecal occult blood tests and one stool dna test guaiac fobt this was the first stool test for colorectal screening says dr robin mendelsohn a gastroenterologist at memorial sloan kettering cancer center mendelsohn says the concept for the guaiac fobt originated from the idea that colon cancer bled into the colon and then into the stool guaiac fobt detects heme an iron compound in the blood that carries oxygen in the stool the guaiac fobt is not specific to human heme mendelsohn says so if you consume meat before the test it could affect the results to do a guaiac fobt you ll use a kit to collect stool from three different bowel movements and send the samples to a lab for analysis the need for three samples is due to the intermittent nature of bleeding from a tumor mendelsohn says if you choose this method of colorectal screening you ll need to repeat the test yearly when a guaiac fobt is performed every one to two years in adults to years old it can reduce deaths from colorectal cancer by to percent according to the national cancer institute fecal immunochemical test or fit the fit detects human hemoglobin maddipatla says it doesn t react to non human blood so there are no dietary restrictions prior to the test maddipatla says this test is easier than the guaiac fobt as it only requires one stool sample which must be mailed back to the lab right away for an accurate result although other conditions such as a lower gastrointestinal bleed can produce a positive result the fit produces fewer false positives than the guaiac fobt maddipatla says and is almost equal to colonoscopy in reducing mortality from colorectal cancer the fit is approximately percent sensitive for detecting cancer and to percent sensitive for detecting advanced polyps the colonoscopy is still the gold standard maddipatla says unlike a colonoscopy a visual examination of the full length of the colon and rectum the guiaic fobt and fit only detect cancers or polyps a colonoscopy can help prevent cancer by removing polyps before they have a chance to develop into a tumor many patients prefer the simplicity of stool testing to undergoing a colonoscopy however if you have a positive result with either a guaiac fobt or fit you may have polyps or colon cancer and you ll need to proceed with a diagnostic colonoscopy mendelsohn says there s no point in doing stool tests if you re not willing to do a colonoscopy afterwards fit dna you may have seen advertisements for the cologuard fit dna test according to the nci cologuard detects both tiny amounts of blood in the stool the fit portion as well as nine biomarkers in three genes that have been found in colorectal cancer and advanced polyps the nci says for average risk adults who didn t have symptoms the fit dna test detected more cancers and adenomas advanced polyps than the fit but had more false positives mendelsohn says there are no long term studies on fit dna so doctors aren t sure how frequently patients should undergo it medicare reimburses for the test every three years she says and depending on the manufacturer the guidelines recommend repeating the test every one to three years mendelsohn says she is uncomfortable with the rate of false positives which is about to percent as with the guiaic fobt and the fit a positive result means you still need to undergo a colonoscopy the bottom line adults at average risk for colorectal cancer should begin colorectal screening at age talk to your doctor about which test is right for you the affordable care act and medicare cover screening for colorectal cancer check with your insurer about which tests are covered and what your out of pocket costs might be,1
longest study of its kind concludes current prescribing guidelines are correct and that statins show impressive benefits for men with high cholesterol levels this article is more than years old this article is more than years old statins cut the risk of dying from heart disease by among men according to the longest study of its kind the year project examined data from men taking part in a randomised clinical trial to test the effects of statins versus a placebo all the men had very high levels of ldl or bad cholesterol higher than mmol l but had no evidence of heart disease at the start of the study nearly all men over and women over eligible for statins analysis suggests read more researchers from imperial college london and the university of glasgow found impressive results among those on statins who were given the widely prescribed type pravastatin they found that compared with the placebo there was a reduced risk of coronary heart disease a reduced risk of dying from coronary heart disease and a reduced risk of coronary events such as a heart attack there was also an reduced risk of dying from any cause over the year period senior author professor kausik ray from imperial s school of public health said for the first time we show that statins reduce the risk of death in this specific group of people who appear largely healthy except for very high ldl levels this legitimises current guidelines which recommend treating this population with statins ray said people with lower levels of cholesterol around mmol l who otherwise appear healthy should also be treated with statins statins prevent heart attacks and strokes a year in uk study finds read more ray added this is the strongest evidence yet that statins reduce the risk of heart disease and death in men with high ldl our study lends support to ldl s status as a major driver of heart disease risk and suggests that even modest ldl reductions might offer significant mortality benefits in the long term our analysis firmly establishes that controlling ldl over time translates to fewer deaths in this population professor sir nilesh samani medical director at the british heart foundation said this research further demonstrates the benefits of statins for people who have high levels of cholesterol in their blood it shows the enduring and long term benefit of taking statins including the extent to which they reduce the risk of dying from heart disease which can only be seen in a study of this length the role of cholesterol in causing heart disease has been disputed by some but this paper provides yet more evidence of the link and the benefits of statins to prevent heart disease,1
after years of growing doubt about the value of screening men for prostate cancer a new analysis of existing clinical trial evidence has found that when men between and get the prostate specific antigen psa test the result is lives saved in a new england journal of medicine editorialist famously called the debate over psa testing for prostate cancer the controversy that refuses to die that comment came with the publication of two clinical trials one conducted in the united states the second in europe that drew two contradictory conclusions on prostate cancer testing the u s undertaking called the prostate lung colorectal and ovarian cancer screening plco trial found that screening men for prostate cancer does not save lives the european randomized study of screening for prostate cancer suggested that screening drove down the rate of deaths from prostate cancer by in a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening american men for prostate cancer with the psa test and in april the u s preventive services task force dumped the decision squarely into the laps of patients and their doctors some men between and years of age might well decide to get their psa checked the task force said after hearing the ledger of pros and cons however others in that age bracket might just as reasonably skip the screening test the panel concluded advertisement the new research published monday in the annals of internal medicine now calls those recommendations into question the authors of the study led by biostatistician ruth etzioni of fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle concluded that screening men over age can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk for prostate cancer death when men who fit the criteria for screening get the psa test the reduction in deaths due to prostate cancer was between and the new study found but the newly published analysis also underscores that the value of prostate cancer screening rests heavily on which men you screen where and for how long you conduct the clinical trial and how you crunch the numbers in the end said vanderbilt university urological surgeon dr sam chang the new analysis reinforces what urological surgeons and treating physicians have thought all along that psa screening is helpful advertisement but it is helpful said chang only when it focuses on the right men those between and and when it is tempered by an understanding that not all worrisome findings are evidence of disease that should be treated aggressively sometimes said chang who was not involved in the newly published article a man will get a problematic psa test reading and decide not to act on it immediately or aggressively but knowing there is a decision to be made is probably a better basis for planning than not knowing he added over the past five to years there has been a better understanding by everyone about the harms of over treatment chang said you want to avoid over diagnosis and over treatment chang underscored that for two groups in particular african american men and those with a first degree relative who died of prostate cancer knowing is especially important because the risks of aggressive disease in such populations is much higher than for others neither group was the subject of special attention in the newly published analysis in an editorial published alongside the new analysis andrew vickers of memorial sloan kettering cancer center also made clear that it s what patients and their physicians do after the psa test that matters most unfortunately the way screening has been implemented in the united states leaves much to be desired vickers wrote the controversy about psa based screening should no longer be whether it can do good but whether we can change our behavior so that it does more good than harm he added prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer found in men affecting of american men according to the centers for disease control prevention in the latest year for which figures are available got a diagnosis of prostate cancer and died of it but a change in a man s reading on the psa test is a highly imperfect gauge of trouble approximately of positive psa test results are thought to produce false positives creating scares that prompt men to get biopsies and treatment which carries with it a high risk of subsequent difficulties with sexual function urination and bowel movements is often unnecessary because prostate cancers are often so slow growing they will never make a man sick advertisement as a result of this growing skepticism about whom to screen for prostate cancer and whether to treat it more and more men are skipping the psa test and among those who get it and get back a worrisome finding fewer and fewer are opting to treat it earlier this year a long running clinical trial found no evidence that patients who got an early prostate cancer diagnosis and chose active surveillance sometimes called watchful waiting were no more likely to die of the disease than were men who got the same diagnosis and treated it aggressively latmelissahealy,1
it turns out that cholesterol isn t the only thing you have to worry about to keep your heart healthy in recent years doctors have started to focus on inflammation the same process that makes cuts red and painful as an important contributor to a heart attack it s the reason doctors recommend low dose aspirin to prevent recurrent heart attacks in people who have already had them why they also prescribe statins which lower both cholesterol and inflammation and why they have started to measure inflammation levels in the blood but it s never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk since statins lower both it s hard to tell whether inflammation or cholesterol has the bigger impact on heart problems more why inflammation in your mouth may raise your risk of cancer but in a new paper published in the new england journal of medicine and presented at the european society of cardiology meeting scientists say they now have proof that lowering inflammation alone without affecting cholesterol also reduces the risk of a heart attack in the study people who have already had a heart attack were randomly assigned to get injected with a placebo or different doses of a drug called canakinumab canakinumab made by novartis is currently approved to treat rare immune related conditions and works to reduce inflammation but does not affect cholesterol levels after four years the people who received the drug had a lower chance of having a heart attack or stroke compared to people who didn t get the drug the medication also reduced the need for angioplasty or bypass surgery by even i am pinching myself says dr paul ridker who led the study and is director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at brigham and women s hospital and is a pioneer in exposing the role inflammation plays in heart disease this outcome is more than we hoped for the bottom line is we now have clear evidence that lowering inflammation through this pathway lowers rates of heart attack and stroke with no change at all in cholesterol about a quarter of people who have heart attacks will have another heart event even if they keep their cholesterol at recommended levels for them it may not be cholesterol so much as inflammation that is driving their heart disease so the study further solidifies the fact that heart doctors should be measure inflammation as well as cholesterol in their heart patients an inexpensive blood test that looks for a protein that rises in the blood with inflammation called c reactive protein crp can tell doctors how much inflammation their patients have beginning in the american heart association started to provide guidelines on how doctors should use crp testing for patients like those in the current trial the group did not see any additional benefit to crp testing since those patients should already be treated with statins which can lower both cholesterol and inflammation get the brief sign up to

newsletters if you don t get the confirmation within minutes please check your spam folder but with the new results those guidelines may change ridker says the findings should clarify how doctors can optimize the way they treat their heart patients about half of people who have had a heart attack tend to have high levels of inflammatory factors while half have high cholesterol levels the inexpensive crp test could identify those with higher inflammation who might be candidates for taking a drug like canakinumab the drug is not currently approved for any heart conditions but novartis will likely look at doing more studies to confirm its effectiveness in treating heart disease perhaps more intriguing are additional results that ridker reported related to cancer in a separate study published in the lancet using data from the same study he found that people taking canakinumab lowered their risk of dying from any cancer over four years by and their risk of fatal lung cancer by while the connection between heart disease and cancer may not seem obvious ridker says that many people who have had heart problems like those in the study are former or current smokers since smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks and smoking increases inflammation people who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day are chronically inflaming their lungs he says that s why he decided to look at cancer deaths as well as heart events in his study population the cancer data is still preliminary and needs to be confirmed with additional studies but it s encouraging says dr otis bradley chief medical officer for the american cancer society who was not involved in the study we know that free oxygen radicals and inflammation can damage dna and can cause cancer he says this all makes sense to me studies have already shown for example that inflammation may be a factor in prostate cancer and colon cancer but whether anti inflammatory agents like canakinumab or even over the counter drugs like aspirin should be part of standard cancer treatment isn t clear yet there are a number of different inflammatory pathways and canakinumab targets just one other pathways along with new anti inflammatory drugs may emerge with more research when it comes to heart disease however it s clear that inflammation fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment ten years from now we will be doing more personalized medicine says ridker some people will get more cholesterol lowering some will get more inflammation lowering drugs some will get other agents that we haven t considered yet it s a wonderful new era in heart disease treatment contact us at,1

in a long term study of the latest treatment for peanut allergy scientists in australia report that an immune based therapy helped children allergic to peanuts eat them without reactions for four years the study published in the journal lancet child adolescent health follows up on children enrolled in an earlier study of an immunotherapy treatment which combined probiotics with small doses of peanuts that were designed to gradually train the children s immune systems to accept the peanut allergen rather than treat it as something foreign previous studies have suggested that methods like these could be effective in reducing youngsters allergic sometimes dangerous anaphylactic shock reactions to peanuts the australian team added probiotics to further enhance the gut s ability to accept the peanuts and not trigger an immune reaction compared to of children who didn t get any treatment of those receiving the combination therapy significantly reduced their allergic reactions to peanuts more babies should eat eggs and peanuts early to avoid food allergies in the follow up which tracked the children for four years after they were treated with the combination therapy of those who got the combination probiotic and peanut therapy were comfortable eating peanuts compared to only of those who did not get the treatment fewer children in the treated group had an allergic reaction to the peanuts and they also showed smaller reactions to skin prick tests with peanut allergen the results are encouraging allowing the children who were treated to eat peanuts without fear of an allergic reaction but it may be too early to call this a cure the researchers believe that adding probiotics to the peanut allergens may be important in improving the children s tolerance to the food but dr anna nowak wegrzyn an associate professor of pediatrics at icahn school of medicine at mt sinai hospital who was not involved in the study notes that the researchers didn t compare the effect of the probiotics themselves they only compared children who received the probiotics along with immune therapy to those who didn t get any treatment at all health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now it makes sense that the probiotics may enhance the immunotherapy s effect since probiotics are beneficial bacteria in the gut where food allergens are processed i think there is certainly a suggestion but not hard proof that the probiotics make a difference says nowak wegrzyn the question for me would be if there is a difference between patients who were treated with both immunotherapy in the form of low doses of peanuts and probiotics and those who were treated with just immunotherapy that may have to wait for another study but the new findings provide even more evidence that using peanuts to treat peanut allergy and to re train the immune system to be less allergic can be effective contact us at,1

flattening the mummy tummy with exercise minutes a day enlarge this image toggle caption talia herman for npr talia herman for npr i admit it i have a mummy tummy also known as mommy pooch you know that soft jelly belly you retain after having a baby it makes you look a few months pregnant i ve tried to convince myself that the pooch is a valiant badge of motherhood but who am i kidding the pooch bothers me and it turns out it has been causing back pain so when i hear that a fitness coach and doctor have come up with a technique that can flatten the pooch quickly and easily i think why not a few weeks later i m rolling out a yoga mat with a dozen other moms and pregnant women in san francisco we will see a dramatic change says leah keller who leads the class you can easily expect to see inches off your waist in three weeks of time keller says that s not an unrealistic expectation we had patients that were even one year out from giving birth and they still had such great benefit from the exercises decked out in purple yoga pants and leather cowboy boots keller is a personal trainer from new york city she has developed an exercise that allegedly shrinks the mommy pooch there is science to back up the method she says a doctor at weill cornell and i did a study on the exact same program we re going to do keller says and we found percent of women achieved full resolution enlarge this image toggle caption talia herman for npr talia herman for npr ok wait a second two inches off my belly in three weeks that sounds too good to be true i decide to do a little digging into the science of mummy tummy and keller s claim putting the six pack back together it turns out the jelly belly actually has a medical name diastasis recti which refers to a separation of the abdominal muscles and it s quite common last year a study from norway reported about a third of moms end up with diastasis recti a year after giving birth this is such a ubiquitous issue says dr geeta sharma an ob gyn at weill cornell medical center new york presbyterian hospital and it s not just a cosmetic problem diastasis recti can cause another problem for new moms lower back pain people can start feeling some back pain because the core is weakened sharma says the diastasis recti during pregnancy the abdominal muscles responsible for a six pack stretch apart left to accommodate a growing fetus after birth the muscles don t always bounce back leaving a gap known as the mommy pooch how to test for diastasis recti there s a simple way to see whether you have diastasis recti lie flat on your back with your knees bent put your fingers right above your belly button and press down gently then lift up your head about an inch while keeping your shoulders on the ground if you have diastasis recti you will feel a gap between the muscles that is wider than an inch in rare occasions the tissue in the abdomen isn t just stretched but it is also torn a bit this can cause a hernia sharma says if there s a defect in a layer of tissue called the linea alba then the bowel can poke through sharma says that s going to be more dangerous a hernia may require surgery so i will refer patients to a general surgeon to have a ct scan if there s really a true concern about a hernia sharma says diastasis recti arises during pregnancy because the growing fetus pushes the abdominal muscles apart specifically the rectus abdominal muscles these are the muscles that give you a six pack says dr linda brubaker an ob gyn at the university of california san diego people think these muscles go horizontal across the belly but they actually go vertical from head to toe the rectus abdominal muscles should be right next to each other on either side of the belly button brubaker says there shouldn t be much of gap between them but during pregnancy a gap opens up between the muscles right around the belly button sometimes that gap closes on its own but other times it stays open that leaves a spot in the belly where there is very little muscle to hold in your stomach and other organs a spot that can be to inches wide that lets the organs and overlying tissue bulge out and cause mommy pooch to flatten the area women have to get those abdominal muscles to realign and that is where the exercises come into play if you search online for ways to fix diastasis recti you ll turn up a deluge of exercise routines all claiming to help coax the abdominal muscles back together but the quality of much of that information isn t good brubaker says some of it is actually potentially harmful even some exercises aimed at strengthening the abdomen can exacerbate diastasis recti says keller including simple crunches you have to be very careful she says for example please don t ever again in your life do crossover crunches or bicycle crunches they splay your abs apart in so many ways that said there are a few exercise programs for diastasis recti that many doctors and physical therapists support these include the tupler technique keller s dia method and the mutu system in the u k most such courses taught once a week for an hour in new york san francisco and at least a few other places tend to run about four to weeks and cost around to some places offer online classes and videos which are much less expensive the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists also recommends abdominal exercises for the perinatal period but the organization s guidelines don t provide details such as which exercises work best or how often women should do them and for how long plus acog focuses more on preventing diastasis than on fixing the problem it recommends strengthening the abdomen before and during pregnancy toggle caption talia herman for npr the best way is prevention says dr raul artal an ob gyn at st louis university who helped acog write its exercise guidelines for the perinatal period the best way to do that is to exercise during pregnancy but as sharma the cornell ob gyn points out no one has really vigorously studied these various exercises to see whether they actually fix diastasis recti there s a general knowledge that exercise is going to help sharma says but no one has really tested them in a standardized way in fact the few studies that have been done haven t been high enough quality to draw conclusions researchers in australia said a few years ago sharma hopes to change that a few years ago she teamed up with keller to start to gather some evidence on her technique we did a pilot study to see if the method is helpful for women sharma says the study was small just women but the results were quite promising after weeks of doing keller s exercise minutes a day all the women had fixed their diastasis recti sharma and keller reported at acog s annual meeting few years ago we had patients that were even one year out from giving birth and they still had such great benefit from the exercises sharma says we love to see that there is something we can do to help women enlarge this image toggle caption talia herman for npr talia herman for npr now sharma says she is working to put together a larger study to really nail down when the exercise works and how well tight and tighter back at the class in san francisco keller is taking us moms through the key exercise it s surprisingly simple to do the exercise is a very small very intense movement that s almost imperceptible keller says ok we re going to do another set sitting on the floor cross legged with our hands on our bellies we all take a big breath let the belly fully expand keller says and then as we exhale we suck in our belly muscles as far back as they ll go toward the spine now we re going to stay here near the spine hold this position she says then we take tiny breaths with each exhale we push our stomachs back further and further tight tighter keller chants rhythmically you can do the exercise in several different positions keller says sitting crossed legged sitting on your knees standing with knees slightly bent on all fours or laying on your side in the fetal position the key is to be sure your back is flat and that you do the exercise minutes each day changing positions every two minutes or so for the rest of the time your belly is pulled all the way back into the spine the fingertips on the bellybutton are really important for this reason she says so you know that you re squeezing tight tighter with the belly and you re never bulging the bellybutton forward this is our fourth week of class and we ve been doing this same exercise on our own every day for at least minutes so it s judgment day time to see whether we ve flattened our bellies and resolved the diastasis recti keller pulls out a measuring tape and starts wrapping it around women s middles she also has us lie down on the floor so she can measure the separation in our abdominal muscles one by one there is success after success several moms completely closed up their abdominal separations many lost inches from their bellies one woman had amazing results oh my goodness you lost nearly four inches from your belly circumference keller exclaims that s amazing how did i fare well after three weeks i didn t completely close up the abdominal separation my separation decreased from inches to inches but i did drop more than an inch from my belly circumference and i am quite happy with the results my abs are definitely firmer and regularly doing this exercise brought a bonus benefit my lower back pain has almost completely gone away i continued to do the exercises after the class had finished i checked with in keller three weeks later to have her measure my diastasis recti at that point the separation had dropped down to inches which meant technically i no longer have diastasis recti,1
scientists edge closer to elusive lab test for chronic fatigue syndrome enlarge this image toggle caption malte mueller getty images malte mueller getty images imagine feeling horribly sick day after day yet doctors repeatedly tell you they can t find anything wrong that typically happens to people with the mysterious illness commonly known as chronic fatigue syndrome research findings from stanford university released monday could point the way to a long sought diagnostic laboratory test for the condition and possibly a first ever treatment believed to affect at least a million people in the u s the condition is now increasingly termed myalgic encephalomyelitis chronic fatigue syndrome or me cfs for short many patients see the name chronic fatigue syndrome as trivializing and misleading giving the impression that they re simply tired or depressed in fact they re experiencing profound exhaustion that isn t relieved with sleep flu like symptoms muscle pain brain fog and various other physical symptoms all of which characteristically worsen with even minor exertion a institute of medicine report proposed the name systemic exertion intolerance disease but it hasn t really stuck the symptoms can range from mild to extremely severe with about a quarter of patients so ill they re mostly or completely confined to bed now the stanford researchers have linked me cfs to variations in certain cytokines immune signaling proteins that track with illness severity the study results were published online monday in the the proceedings of the national academy of sciences the link to gradation in severity rather than simply seeking a positive versus negative result represents a new approach to the search for biological markers for the illness the study involved me cfs patients and healthy controls matched for age and sex out of cytokines investigated via sophisticated fluorescence based testing only two of the cytokines differed in their total concentrations between the me cfs and control groups but levels of of the cytokines varied dramatically between the patients with mild versus severe me cfs symptoms of those cytokines were types that promote inflammation this is significant because symptoms in these patients and findings from other studies also suggest that chronic inflammation plays a major role in the illness this is a field that has been full of skepticism and misconception where patients have been viewed to have invented their disease these data clearly show the contrary and demonstrate what can be achieved when we couple good research design with new technology lead author dr jose montoya professor of infectious diseases at stanford tells shots according to dr anthony l komaroff a harvard internist and epidemiologist who has written a commentary to accompany the study for many years medical scientists have speculated that the symptoms of me cfs might be caused by cytokines molecules that the immune system use to wage war against foreign invaders of the body past studies have shown high levels of many cytokines but it was not clear that these high levels were causing symptoms what the latest research shows komaroff tells shots is that levels of many cytokines do correlate with symptoms the higher the blood level the worse the symptoms that supports the theory that the cytokines are a cause of the symptoms so why do routine lab tests that doctors order often come back negative or not informative in me cfs patients simply put montoya says those tests aren t measuring the right things two classic laboratory measures of inflammation are sedimentation rate the ability of red blood cells to clump together which isn t a factor in me cfs and c reactive protein which reflects levels of a single cytokine that wasn t one of those linked to severity in this study inflammation is much more complicated than two imperfect old measures montoya says we re showing an inflammation that has not been seen before the multidisciplinary stanford team is now working on developing a panel that could be used commercially that would test for around five of the cytokines and would likely involve the doctor first classifying patients by severity in order to interpret the results such a test could both establish the diagnosis and serve to monitor patients responses to treatment what s more the findings also point to possible treatment with immune modifying or anti inflammatory therapy montoya hopes that by publishing these findings a team of researchers somewhere in the world will see these cytokines and say they have the drug for that inflammation we hope drug companies will pursue it indeed a major drug trial is now being conducted in norway investigating whether the immune modifying drug rituximab alleviates me cfs symptoms after preliminary studies suggested that it did in some patients interestingly the drug is approved to treat certain autoimmune diseases and also non hodgkin lymphoma a cancer that one study found uniquely occurs at a higher rate among older people with me cfs komaroff also notes a recent increase in research funding by the national institutes of health which has included a comprehensive in house study aimed at unraveling the underlying causes of the condition and in an ongoing privately funded study stanford geneticist ron davis and a team including three nobel laureates is taking a similar big data approach to investigate a group of me cfs patients who are all severely ill including davis own adult son there is much to learn komaroff writes in the journal hopefully a decade from now doctors will know better what to measure and more importantly what to do to ease the suffering caused by this illness miriam e tucker is a freelance journalist

alzheimer s disease now affects an estimated million americans and after decades of feverish work researchers have so far failed to find a treatment that halts or reverses the inexorable loss of memory function and thinking ability that characterize this feared illness but researchers have been quite successful at devising ways to diagnose alzheimer s earlier and earlier and that capability has emerged alongside evidence of a tantalizing possibility that if you can catch the disease early enough ideally when symptoms of confusion or memory loss are just emerging or before some therapies already in hand might essentially halt its progress for anyone who detects some mental slippage and wonders is it alzheimer s the current state of dementia research raises a very real and very wrenching dilemma if i can know do i want to know that is if it s alzheimer s disease would i do anything differently would there be some benefit in knowing for my loved ones for myself advertisement doctors and insurers including the federal government which administers medicare are asking some variants of the same questions if an effective test which costs between and a shot can diagnose dementia early and distinguish alzheimer s from other forms of dementia should it be recommended to patients with cognitive concerns and routinely covered by their insurance would it make patients lives better or lower the cost of their care newly unveiled research results are bringing some clarity to such deliberations and other new research published wednesday in the journal neurology proposes a new diagnostic tool that may be able to detect alzheimer s and distinguish it from another form of dementia more simply and cheaply than does the best test now available at the alzheimer s assn international conference in london last week researchers reported their preliminary findings from a trial that is testing the impact of diagnostic testing for alzheimer s disease on nearly medicare beneficiaries all of these study participants largely people in their s all with a diagnosis of either mild cognitive impairment or atypical dementia are living with the unconfirmed suspicion that they have alzheimer s the study is underwritten by the centers for medicare medicaid services and the alzheimer s assn it set out to find out whether knowing getting the costly test that would offer either confirmation or reprieve would change the way that patients with cognitive troubles are treated or the way that they plan their lives advertisement the preliminary results suggested it did after getting the results of a pet brain scan to detect and measure amyloid deposits which are the key hallmark of alzheimer s disease roughly two thirds of the subjects saw their medication regimens changed or were counseled differently by their doctors about what to expect that new information may have guided family caregivers in planning their own futures or prodded patients to make financial decisions and power of attorney assignments sooner some who learned that they did not have alzheimer s discontinued medications that can have unpleasant side effects others learned they do have alzheimer s and decided to enroll in clinical trials that will test new drugs a second study presented in london analyzed data from several studies and found that in a large population of research participants with cognitive concerns brain amyloid pet scans led to a change in diagnosis in approximately of cases people should know what s coming said dr maria carrillo chief science officer for the alzheimer s assn the centers for medicare medicaid services has given amyloid scans a provisional approval meaning they do not routinely pay for them the results may guide the agency to rethink its position she added the pet scan bore bad news for ken lehmann who enrolled last year in the ideas trial short for imaging dementia evidence for amyloid scanning after his long slow decline that has flummoxed doctors lehmann s brain scan clearly showed he has alzheimer s disease the certainty that has brought has been a long time coming when lehmann began withdrawing from friends forgetting to pay bills and having trouble following conversations he was just now he s ken had always been considered a renaissance man a furniture company executive who rebuilt porsches played basketball and loved to entertain friends said his wife mary margaret lehmann but as years passed his judgment seemed off he would lose track of points he was making and sometimes of where he was at it would take the loss of their home and a business bankruptcy for the lehmanns to demand answers to what was going on in they moved from sacramento to edina minn to live with a daughter and there at last they found a neurologist who despite initial skepticism but he presents so well the doctor proclaimed diagnosed dementia advertisement for the lehmanns and many patients and families like them as well as for neurologists that diagnosis is often just the beginning of a deeper mystery alzheimer s disease is the most feared and most common form of dementia accounting for between and of all dementia cases diagnosed but at least seven other forms of dementia and dementia linked to the movement disorder parkinson s disease can cause loss of memory reasoning judgment and the ability to speak comprehend and care for oneself to the estimated million americans living with some form of cognitive impairment telling the difference could make a significant difference dementia forms with different origins progress differently or sometimes not at all they respond best to different medications and will come to require different levels of care and treatment some though not alzheimer s can even be reversed with treatment being able to distinguish which form of dementia a patient has should help doctors and caregivers to make better choices but it s a question that until recently could be answered only after death at that point a postmortem examination of the brain could be done to look for the built up clumps and tangles of beta amyloid proteins the overall shrinkage and the loss of neurons in the brain s hippocampus that are collectively the hallmarks of alzheimer s no more improved medical imaging technologies developed over the last decade have made it possible to peer inside the brain of a living patient detect and measure the accumulation of beta amyloid and make a definitive diagnosis in the food and drug administration took a first step in making such imaging possible giving its blessing to the imaging agent florbetapir f which binds to amyloid aggregates in the brain and allows a pet scan to be used to make the diagnosis in two new imaging agents won fda approval and new imaging agents and techniques promise ever more precise means to visualize and diagnose alzheimer s in the brain on wednesday research published in the journal neurology suggested that transcranial magnetic stimulation a technique that can selectively turn up or down activity in different parts of the brain could prove useful in distinguishing between alzheimer s disease from frontotemporal dementia advertisement in many ways ken lehmann s symptoms fit neatly into a diagnosis of frontotemporal dementia a form of cognitive impairment that typically becomes evident earlier than most cases of alzheimer s ftd often affects judgment personality and verbal communication this form of dementia progresses as inexorably as does alzheimer s but its typical course differs slightly as an enrollee in the ideas trial lehmann was prepared to learn what it was he had i had come to the conclusion they just don t know said lehmann now from his home in minnesota in seven years my journey of decline has been very miniscule and they don t know why it turns out he added i have all the biomarkers of alzheimer s disease once he and his wife learned that they stepped up their preparations for further decline and they redoubled their efforts to do things that bring joy and that may slow ken s decline as well they follow a diet rich in fatty fish healthful fats and fruits and vegetables and ken does woodworking he also sings in a minneapolis chorus giving voice with other dementia patients he has regained a long lost ability to read music just not knowing is very disconcerting says mary margaret who is her husband s principal caregiver i don t know what the timeline is but i now know what the needs are in terms of financial and legal needs and end of life issues those all need to be planned for ahead of time and now we have all of that in place to me that s a safety net latmelissahealy more in science cte was nearly ubiquitous among former nfl players

beyond the nasty needle trying to make vaccines more comfy and convenient enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of georgia institute of technology courtesy of georgia institute of technology news this summer of a flu vaccine patch sparked a lot of chatter could getting vaccinated be as easy as putting on a bandage could there be fewer or at least smaller needles in our future some companies and academic labs are working to make those things happen they re refining technologies that involve tiny needles less than a millimeter long and needle free injectors that can send a dose of vaccine through your skin in a fraction of a second some of these technologies are already available on the market while others are still being tested one hundred very tiny needles a flu vaccine patch is not yet available to the public but one version developed by georgia tech s laboratory for drug delivery showed promising results in its first human clinical trial according to a study published in the lancet in june the patch about the size of a small square bandage has tiny dissolvable needles filled with a dose of flu vaccine it s placed on the arm and activated through pressure the microneedles dissolve into the skin releasing the vaccine in the study participants received either the flu vaccine patch a standard flu shot or a placebo via a patch six months later no one involved in the study had gotten the flu people in the microneedle patch groups reported some redness itching and tenderness but no serious side effects people who received the flu patch had comparable immune responses to people who had gotten the flu shot about percent of the patients in the study preferred the patch to the regular shot says yasmine gomaa the lab s associate director now gomaa s lab is looking beyond the flu vaccine she says the microneedle patch could be particularly helpful in developing countries because it uses a form of vaccines that doesn t need to be kept as cold as regular vaccines it can be stored at temperatures as high as degrees fahrenheit for up to a year she says enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of georgia institute of technology courtesy of georgia institute of technology and the patch can be administered by people who aren t trained health professionals a number of the people in the flu patch study applied it to themselves in georgia tech and the pharmaceutical company micron biomedical won million in grants from the bill and melinda gates foundation to develop a patch for polio immunization gomaa s hope is that vaccine patches will cost less than vaccinations do now a study from the centers for disease control and prevention found that the use of vaccine patches could save on cooling costs and could cut down on waste its analysis concluded that a dose of measles vaccine with the patch would cost just under while a typical shot would cost but that didn t take into account the costs of getting the patch to market the potential cost savings wouldn t happen until the patches were in routine use the cdc noted a twist on star trek technology others in the vaccine delivery business are taking a different approach using a new twist on a needle free device called a jet injector that has been around for more than half a century star trek featured such a device calling it a hypospray portal instruments a company that is developing jet injectors uses technology based on work done by ian hunter at the massachusetts institute of technology initially we worked on microneedles says the company s ceo patrick anquetil and then ian realized that why don t we just remove the needle altogether and that s how this project came to be needle free jet injectors were actually used in the s in mass smallpox vaccination campaigns as described by the cdc these devices use a high pressure narrow stream of fluid to penetrate the skin the diameter of the stream is comparable to a mosquito bite the devices were used to quickly vaccinate large numbers of people including members of the armed forces anquetil notes that the older devices sometimes made patients feel as if they had been punched to create the jet you have to instantaneously create times more pressure than you ve got in the tire of a car he says patients actually hated them because they were more painful than a needle and syringe others echo that sentiment my year old neighbor still remembers how painful it was says ron lowy ceo of pharmajet a company that makes an fda approved jet injector that administers a flu vaccine the older devices had another problem they used the same nozzle for multiple injections leading to concerns about the transmission of bloodborne pathogens between patients enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of pharmajet courtesy of pharmajet today s devices have made a lot of progress lowy says now the syringe is changed for each patient and the injections are gentler it feels like somebody snapped me with a rubber band he says adding that the injection happens too fast for some patients to register any sensation at all it lasts about one tenth of a second he says hundreds of thousands of people in the u s have already received the flu vaccine via one of pharmajet s injectors if you have your choice you want to get poked with a needle or you want to try this most of the people say yeah i ll try that he says cost remains an issue for some jet injectors portal is aiming to get its cost down to or per injection in vaccines what s really hard is that there s a very very high volume and you re competing with a needle and syringe which is tremendously low cost anquetil says pharmajet says the ability to give precise doses helps to save money the company says its flu vaccine starter kit which can vaccinate people costs nasal spray hits a roadblock flumist an fda approved flu vaccine delivered through a nasal spray was widely used in the u s and at one point was even the preferred method of vaccination for children then last year in a sharp turnaround the cdc recommended that it not be used during the flu season after a study found it had not been very effective in the previous year particularly among kids the vaccine s effectiveness was just percent so low that no protective benefit could be measured for children ages to the cdc said in a statement in contrast the effectiveness of the flu shot was about percent for kids in that age group astrazeneca the parent company behind flumist says the cdc s data contradicts data from several other studies which show the vaccine was about percent effective during the same flu season and the same vaccine continues to be recommended and used in european union markets astrazeneca says in the u s the cdc continues to recommend against the nasal spray vaccine for the upcoming flu season astrazeneca hopes to reverse that decision before flu season begins we continue to pursue a broad based investigation to identify potential causes of lower effectiveness in recent years the company said in a statement adding that one of the four flu virus strains it used in the vaccine during the past two flu seasons may have been the problem the company has chosen a new strain of live virus that is similar to other strains that have proven effective in studies and clinical trials,1

george burke has a talent for tossing back his daily cocktail which contains vitamins minerals muscle building compounds some little known research drugs and a microdose of lsd in almost a single gulp it s a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows pills a day most of them purchases off the internet burke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in california s silicon valley where he s the co founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees he used to get his edge from adderall but after moving from new jersey to san francisco he says he couldn t find a doctor who would write him a prescription driven to the internet he discovered a world of cognition enhancing drugs known as nootropics some prescription some over the counter others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers said to improve memory attention creativity and motivation it s not like every tech worker in silicon valley is taking nootropics to get ahead burke acknowledges it s the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that the word nootropic was coined in by a romanian scientist corneliu giurgea who combined the greek words for mind and bending caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics while prescription ritalin adderall and provigil modafinil a drug for treating narcolepsy lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off label as cognitive enhancers even microdosing of lsd is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity but when aficionados talk about nootropics they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity most often they mean piracetam which giurgea first synthesized in and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly not so in the united states however where officially it can be sold only for research purposes piracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory sharpening their focus heightening their immune system even bettering their personalities but it s only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family newer ones include aniracetam phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam all are available online where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts using stacks a number of companies now market nootropic stacks or formulas some of which include piracetam herbal remedies amino acids and citicoline a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement intravenously or as a shot because they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims they avoid close government scrutiny when burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago it arrived in baggies filled with white powder it was as if i was buying coke off the street he recalls these days he buys his stack from nootroo a san francisco company but self experimenters such as burke often don t restrict themselves to medication alone dedicated brain hackers as they call themselves are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind their methods include meditation cold water plunges periodic fasting and high fat low carbohydrate ketogenic diets who doesn t want to maximize their cognitive ability who doesn t want to maximize their muscle mass asks murali doraiswamy who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at duke university health system and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the food and drug administration he attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else but while some studies have found short term benefits doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs of any type improve thinking or productivity over the long run there s a sizable demand but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence notes doraiswamy adding that for healthy young people such as silicon valley go getters it s a zero sum game that s because when you up one circuit in the brain you re probably impairing another system short term benefits early studies attributed a lot of short term benefits to nootropics so much so that in russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight a study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with alzheimer s disease the hippocampus an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories typically shows severe shrinkage with alzheimer s the idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting although piracetam has a history of relatively few side effects it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline according to lon schneider a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the keck school of medicine at the university of southern california we don t use it at all and never have as for newer nootropic drugs there are unknown risks piracetam has been studied for decades says cognitive neuroscientist andrew hill the founder of a neurofeedback company in los angeles called peak brain institute but some of the newer compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article copied the formula down and sent it to china and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they re selling please don t take it people for burke and other brain hackers the evidence for nootropics is strong enough burke who begins each morning with a bulletproof coffee a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil has created a san francisco meetup group called peak performance to teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a better every day last spring people showed up at a peak performance event where psychedelic psychologist james fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition enhancing effects of lsd which he listed as less anxiety better focus improved sleep greater creativity was all in the dosage he recommended a tenth of a party dose enough to give you the glow and enhance your cognitive powers without the trip burke says he definitely got the glow the first time i took it i was working on a business plan i had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head i was able to place each contingency on a branch retract and go back to the trunk and in this visual way i was able to juggle more information the effects of fasting not all brain hacking involves taking a pill though nootrobox a san francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins minerals and amino acids promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body we stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being says manuel lam an internal medicine physician who advises nootrobox on clinical issues he and members of the company s executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real time effect of the foods they eat fasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel lam enthuses it s like being strapped to a solar panel the sun is always shining on you nootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every tuesday then meet for breakfast on wednesday at a local diner founded by two stanford university computer graduates the company has initiated an international fasting group on facebook at last count there were members research on animals has shown that intermittent fasting limiting caloric intake at least two days a week can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque a protein prevalent in the brains of people with alzheimer s disease research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice mark mattson chief of the laboratory of neurosciences at the national institute on aging has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting there s pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases he says fasting has been deployed since the ancient greeks to fast track learning as plato is said to have stated i fast for greater physical and mental efficiency the philosopher pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast days before attending his lectures far easier to take a pill looking for an edge vinh ngo a san francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base his office is located in the heart of the city s tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement ngo has experimented with piracetam himself the first time i tried it i thought wow this is pretty strong for a supplement i had a little bit of reflux heartburn but in general it was a cognitive enhancer i found it helpful and the neurotransmitter dmea you have an idea it helps you finish the thought it s for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain but he has also seen patients whose propensity for self experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand one chief executive he treated ngo said developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working unfortunately the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes which can lead to dehydration headaches vision and cardiac problems muscle contractions and in extreme cases seizures there is that culture here in silicon valley that relies on being smarter than your own self ngo says people want to find an edge over their competitor that s how they got their position in the first place i m trying to give them a little more wiggle room but in a safe way he says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests there s no one size fits all approach i don t have a rubber stamp for everyone and not everyone is a candidate for cognitive enhancement says ngo who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics if for example someone decides to go on medication be it adderall albuterol or piracetam the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems i want to empower them ngo says but there s a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy read

wagler s pit viper thursday june healthday news scary pit vipers may need an image upgrade their venom might end up helping human heart patients research suggests taiwanese scientists say a blood thinner drug based on venom from the wagler s pit viper was effective in mice and might prove safer than current anti clotting meds for humans one day the serpent medicine connection isn t new one cardiologist noted since venom typically kills by disrupting the blood s clotting mechanisms blood thinner medications have a long and storied history with snake venom said dr satjit bhysri a heart specialist at lenox hill hospital in new york city in fact many current blood thinners are based on initial experiments from proteins found in snake venom he added in the new study a team led by tur fu huang a pharmacology researcher at national taiwan university focused on the venom of the tropidolaemuswaglerix snake a southeast asian species known as wagler s pit viper or the temple viper the snake s venom contains a protein called trowaglerix the researchers explained designing a molecule based on trowaglerix huang s group was able to block gpvi a protein that sits on the surface of blood platelet cells and is crucial to allowing these cells to clump together and form clots when mixed with blood the new compound prevented blood cells called platelets from clotting also mice that received the drug had slower blood clot formation than untreated mice but the treated mice did not bleed longer than untreated mice still experiments in animals often don t translate to success in humans so further research is needed dr kevin marzo is head of cardiology at nyu winthrop hospital in mineola n y reviewing the findings he agreed that the drug under development may have merit many of the lifesaving drugs used in the treatment of heart attack patients work by inhibiting platelets and preventing blood clotting however it is often at the cost of serious bleeding complications he said the potential development of a new agent based on snake venom that could have similar beneficial effects on preventing blood clotting and potentially cause less bleeding side effects is an exciting discovery that warrants future investigation marzo added the study was published june in the journal arteriosclerosis thrombosis and vascular biology more information the american heart association has more on anti clotting drugs,1
a daily supplement of pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is as good as celecoxib celebrex at relieving arthritic knee pain and doesn t have dangerous side effects researchers say dr jean yves reginster of liege state university in belgium and colleagues recruited people over age with knee osteoarthritis from five european countries and randomly assigned them to take mg of the extra pure chondroitin sulfate chondrosulf mg of celecoxib celebrex or a placebo every day for six months those who took chondroitin sulfate or celecoxib had similar levels of pain relief at the end of the study and in both groups the improvement was greater than for those taking just a placebo according to the report in annals of the rheumatic diseases reginster told reuters health the findings are in line with earlier studies showing pharmaceutical grade chondroitin sulfate could significantly decrease the progression of knee osteoarthritis over a period of three years he stressed that pharmaceutical grade chondroitin is not the same as over the counter supplements which are made differently and can t get into the joint in high enough concentrations to combat the causes of cartilage degradation and pain european regulatory bodies recommend pharmaceutical grade chondroitin sulfate as well as pharmaceutical grade glucosamine sulfate as first line treatments for osteoarthritis reginster said by email because of the side effects associated with celecoxib and other non steroidal inflammatory drugs nsaids including stomach ulcers bleeding liver and kidney problems dr michael shepard of hoag orthopedic institute in orange california noted that the study had a relatively low number of participants and that most u s studies of this type would run two years rather than six months in addition u s based studies of chondroitin have had mixed results said shepard who wasn t involved in the study some have found the supplements to be as effective as ibuprofen also an nsaid and some have found that chondroitin sulfate is no more effective than placebo he told reuters health i tell my patients buyer beware shepard said in an email i tell them about the mixed results of chondroitin in the literature i tell them to try chondroitin for one month as a trial and if they like it and feel better with it then keep taking it if chondroitin doesn t work for them he suggests taking an nsaid periodically and to be aware of the side effects if you are going to stay on an nsaid for a prolonged period then you need regular follow up with your doctor shepard cautioned dr rachel wolfe of wake forest baptist medical center in winston salem north carolina agreed that chondroitin is reasonable to try for some people especially those with contraindications to nsaids however it should not replace other therapy such as quad strengthening exercises and weight loss which we know will provide benefit it should be used in conjunction with these measures said wolfe who wasn t involved in the study chondroitin is not a miracle pill but if it allows people to feel less pain and be more active thereby losing weight and strengthening muscles then i think there may benefit wolfe told reuters health by email studies like this highlight that medicine is still an art we do not have perfect answers and we have to individualize for each patient the study was sponsored by ibsa institut biochimique sa a pharmaceutical company based in lugano switzerland that makes the chondroitin sulfate supplements used in the test source bit ly rcplh annals of the rheumatic diseases online may,1
the procedure called a prostatic urethral lift does not improve flow as much as surgery in which a physician cuts away some of the inside of the prostate to allow better flow but the lift procedure and recovery are much quicker with no hospital stay and fewer complications and patients who get the sutures can always come back for surgery later,1
with little fanfare the food and drug administration did something this week that it s never done before the agency approved a single prescription drug pembrolizumab marketed by merck as keytruda for treatment of solid tumors in any organ so long as the malignancy bears a specific genetic signature in the fast moving field of cancer treatment the fda s announcement marks an important milestone close to two decades in the making increasingly cancer will no longer be identified categorized and treated by the organ it inhabits or in which it first gained its foothold in a shift that is already underway cancers will be known by and treated for the common genetic mutations that nurture and sustain them in clinical trial evidence cited by the fda this week pembrolizumab induced complete or partial tumor shrinkage in about of patients with one of end stage malignancies and for of those patients that response lasted six months or more a trial reported earlier this year found that in of advanced cancer patients pembrolizumab stopped or reversed the progression of cancer and patients were still alive a year after starting the drug all of those subjects of course had cancers with the genetic mutation that pembrolizumab is designed to target advertisement in the treatment of patients with metastatic cancers that have failed all other treatments that record of success constitutes a home run said dr bert vogelstein of johns hopkins university s kimmel cancer center vogelstein s research laid the groundwork for the discovery of pembrolizumab s broad cancer fighting powers with the fda s announcement drugs like pembrolizumab have also begun to change the way that physicians patients and government regulators think of cancer no longer will they see all cancers of the lung breast colon brain liver pancreas and prostate as distinct from one another instead they will look for the common genetic mutations that give rise to cancers no matter where they re found and they ll treat those cancers with a drug that uses that common signature as a homing beacon either for the immune system or for targeted cancer drugs to attack it s a key principle of what s called precision medicine the idea that cancer therapies should zero in on a tumor s specific molecular fingerprint and not as most chemotherapies do harm healthy cells in the process of attacking malignant ones in the cancers pembrolizumab treats the mutations occur in the complex of genes that govern dna repair deficiencies in the dna s mismatch repair system generate mutant proteins on the surface of cancer cells and pembrolizumab trains the immune system to attack those targets the mutations that make pembrolizumab effective had already been found in melanoma non small cell lung cancer head and neck cancer and hodgkin s lymphoma and the fda had already approved the drug for those cancers before this week advertisement but this week s fda approval goes further it makes clear that the drug s molecular targets are also common in colorectal endometrial and gastrointestinal cancers and less frequently present in cancers of the breast prostate bladder and thyroid gland all told scientists believe about of advanced cancers bear the genetic signature that would make them treatable by keytruda the appearance of such a cancer workhorse will bring about profound changes on the cancer landscape not just for patients but for researchers and drug regulators as well organizations representing say people with pancreatic cancer will make common cause with groups that advocate for colorectal cancer patients in cancer centers specialists in say melanoma will start in fact have already started treating patients with a range of other cancers when drug companies and their academic partners set out to test the effectiveness of a prospective cancer drug they ll have to recruit trial subjects using a new and much less obvious criterion than they ve used in the past the genetic signatures their tumors bear even before the fda s announcement this week all these processes were underway the fda s decision recognizes that fact said dr svetomir markovic an immunologist at the mayo clinic in rochester minn who specializes in treating melanoma but the decision also puts cancer physicians as well as insurers who will be called on to pay keytruda s per year price tag on notice that a new era is at hand said markovic the field of cancer medicine is changing at lightning speed he said physicians are having a hard time keeping up and i can only imagine that people who are regulating it are doing the same he added but this decision by the fda is really wonderful it has made it easier for us to secure treatment for our patients who may have run out of options that may help two other immunotherapy drugs have been approved for cancer treatment nivolumab marketed as opdivo and ipilimumab yervoy but neither has been shown to treat cancers across such a broad spectrum several other immunotherapy drugs are in early trials and could yet prove to be the sort of workhorse that pembrolizumab appears to be advertisement in many ways we re at the end of the beginning of immunotherapy there s clear benefit but it s still a minority of patients that get long term benefit said markovic of the mayo institute we will get better at this markovic suggested that the newly recognized powers of pembrolizumab as well as the fda s new openness to cancer drugs that blur traditional distinctions could prompt drug companies physicians and patient groups to take a second look at some abandoned cancer drugs with a clearer idea of which patients they might help and a willingness to design and conduct innovative clinical trials some failures may look more promising he said we just needed to take the first step in showing that this long believed theory that the immune system can kill cancer is true markovic added it indeed can latmelissahealy,1

en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter friday may healthday news blood thinners are often prescribed to prevent strokes in people with the abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation but a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay the researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners such as warfarin soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed that s true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn t normally be given blood thinners we found that people who are on warfarin the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation experienced very low rates of dementia including alzheimer s disease said lead researcher dr t jared bunch he s director of heart rhythm research at intermountain medical center heart institute in murray utah atrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly million american adults it causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver this causes blood to pool and then it can clot atrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren t even aware of bunch explained while many patients are initially given aspirin bunch said aspirin s benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner although the study looked at patients taking warfarin coumadin newer drugs including rivaroxaban xarelto and apixaban eliquis should reduce the risk of dementia even more bunch said in patients with atrial fibrillation the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so called chads score the researchers said this score assigns points for several risk factors such as age high blood pressure heart disease diabetes and a previous stroke a score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren t needed because the risk for stroke is low for patients with scores above one blood thinners are considered necessary as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk according to the researchers in this study however the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia in patients considered at low risk for stroke delaying blood thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia percent in high risk patients a delay increased the risk percent the researchers reported the longer the delay in giving blood thinners the more the risk for dementia the researchers said for the study bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia the average age of the study participants was and percent were male the researchers looked at when treatment began either within days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis which was considered immediate or after a year which was considered delayed once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation starting stroke prevention strategies immediately is essential we shouldn t wait longer than a month to begin treatment bunch said the delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later he added the results of the study were scheduled for presentation friday at the meeting of the heart rhythm society in chicago findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they ve been published in a peer reviewed journal according to dr byron lee of the university of california san francisco ucsf there is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at ucsf therefore he said we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants blood thinners when indicated this study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive mental decline lee said more information for more on atrial fibrillation visit the american heart association,1

up until the mona lisa touch laser there has not been a successful non medication alternative treatment option for vaginal dryness also known at vulvo vaginal atrophy or vva women in menopause or those who cannot take estrogen including our breast cancer survivors often suffer in silence when their vagina decides to completely dry up and lose its moist and supple lining causing disruptive symptoms it can affect your ability to do everyday activities such as exercise and engage in sexual contact and intercourse due to pain and discomfort symptoms of vva include dryness burning irritation itching urinary incontinence and urinary frequency these symptoms are mainly caused by a condition called vaginal atrophy which is due to menopause or peri menopause or occurs after child birth women with vva report the following percent of women report vaginal atrophy negatively impacts their lives percent failed to recognize vaginal atrophy as a chronic condition percent report they did not consult a gynecologist for finding a solution percent only recognized the common symptoms of vaginal atrophy estrogen is the best treatment option for vva since it rehydrates the vagina and restores lubrication and ph balance in the vagina unfortunately this is not always an appropriate option especially if you have breast cancer or are unable or unwilling to be on estrogen other medication options include osphena vaginal estrogen steroid and testosterone creams and lubrications or moisturizers the mona lisa touch laser treatment or mllt is one of the newest kids on the block to combat vaginal atrophy there are other types of vaginal lasers but they don t have the same track record food and drug administration support and long term studies as the mllt an italian built laser device the mona lisa touch laser holds tremendous promise in treating a vagina that has been transformed in menopause or via cancer treatment side effects once you ve had a pelvic exam to assure you re an appropriate candidate a physician trained in the use of the mona lisa which is actually a small vaginal laser inserts the device into the vagina during three minute sessions six weeks apart many women report positive changes after just the first minute treatment which involves removing the dried skin inside that vagina stimulating collagen and blood flow production and allowing vaginal revival the end result is a vagina makeover a new lease on a vagina if you will with more elasticity and natural lubrication of the tissue inside the vagina although it may sound too good to be true the results are proving to be a game changer in the way vagina atrophy is being treated without hormones which is a relief to many women and their partners mona lisa is ideal for women who can t take estrogen due to a personal or family history of breast cancer or for those who are unhappy with the side effects associated with hormone replacement therapy still there is a painful part of the procedure the cost it runs about a session and is most likely not covered by insurance,1
a minimally invasive procedure designed to shrink prostate tissue with a series of nine second blasts of steam offers men a new treatment for urinary symptoms commonly associated with enlarged

implant the procedure which costs about and generally is covered by insurance can be done in a doctor s office in just a few minutes to dull pain lidocaine may be injected into the prostate and most doctors will offer a sedative for patients who want one after the procedure most patients need to wear a catheter for two or three days but can return to daily activities immediately while the results of a two year clinical trial published by dr roehrborn and colleagues show that rezūm provides significant relief from symptoms it isn t clear how long the improvement will last the durability issue is what s going to sink or swim this procedure says study co author kevin t mcvary chairman and professor of urology at southern illinois university school of medicine in springfield ill both minimally invasive options are likely less effective than surgery dr roehrborn says because surgery removes the most tissue still for many men the steam treatment offers an appealing middle ground between the risk of surgery and the hassle and side effects of taking daily medication which can cause dizziness and fatigue i tried flomax for about two years but the side effects were too annoying says stephen gooding a year old utility supervisor from grayson ga who says the drug made him dizzy and constipated he had the rezūm procedure in october and now i feel like i did years ago journal report podcast subscribe to the journal report podcast at wsj com on itunes or google play music in the two year study of men funded by nxthera and published online in the journal of urology in december patients who had the rezūm procedure showed a significantly greater improvement in symptoms at three months compared with patients who had a sham procedure at the end of two years patients treated with rezūm showed a reduction in urinary symptoms as measured by a seven question survey compared with the beginning of the study over the two years about of the patients who underwent rezūm had to have a repeat procedure or surgery to treat their condition early in the trial physicians were new at performing the procedure and didn t always remove enough tissue says cindy ogden vice president clinical affairs at nxthera so far rezūm appears to spare men sexual side effects in the surgical procedure known as transurethral resection to of men generally get a condition called retrograde ejaculation also called dry orgasm says dr mcvary in the rezūm study about of the patients who underwent the procedure experienced no ejaculatory volume afterward and experienced a decrease in ejaculatory volume according to data provided by nxthera ejaculatory volume can fluctuate over time in men with enlarged prostates so it isn t clear the reductions were caused by the procedure dr mcvary says overall in the study there was no average change in ejaculatory volume he adds larger prostates a major advantage of rezūm is that it can be done on most types of anatomies urolift isn t approved by the food and drug administration to treat the median or middle lobe of the prostate which contributes to symptoms in about to of patients dr roehrborn says the fda hasn t cleared rezūm or urolift for prostates weighing more than grams so nxthera can t market its procedure for larger prostates though doctors can legally use it on such patients if they choose early results in clinical practice on large prostates appear promising and a study on prostates up to grams is expected to begin later this year says ricardo gonzalez a urologist at texas medical center in houston who will be a principal investigator on the research about a quarter of men seeking treatment for prostate related urinary symptoms have prostates greater than grams he says business executive jim bracke says that with just a tylenol and the lidocaine shot discomfort from rezūm s steam blasts felt no more intense than warm water spilled on the groin he drove himself home after the procedure and says he s thrilled that he no longer needs to check out a bathroom the moment he arrives at a restaurant and as long as he doesn t overdo it he adds i can have beer and coffee and chocolate and still sleep

the new study is the latest chapter in an extraordinary decades long collaboration among cognitive scientists brain surgeons and people with severe epilepsy being evaluated for an operation the preoperative evaluation is a fishing expedition of sorts in which doctors sink an array of electrodes through the top of the skull and wait for a seizure to occur to see whether it s operable many of the electrodes sit in or near memory areas and the wait can take weeks in the hospital cognitive scientists use this opportunity with patients consent to present memory tests and take recordings this approach called direct neural recording and piggybacking entirely on the clinical placement of the electrodes has become the leading edge of research into the biology of human memory this study used data from patients and had collaborators from institutions around the country including emory university the university of washington the mayo clinic and the university of california san francisco in a series of experiments the researchers had patients memorize lists of words and later after a distraction asked them to freely recall as many of the words as they could all the while the scientists monitored a handful of hot spots in the brain which previous work had shown were strongly related to memory encoding before the stimulation tests the team determined the precise settings for each patient s high and low functioning states each participant carried out the word memorization tests repeatedly with different words every time some lists were memorized with brain stimulation and other lists with no stimulation which served as a control the authors then examined memory performance based on whether stimulation arrived during low compared with high functioning brain states the team then statistically analyzed the results and found that people scored slightly higher than usual on words when stimulation arrived during a low or foggy state and worse when the pulse arrived in a high state the average enhancement effect was about to percent dr kahana said and when stimulation arrived in a good state the average was about to percent worse than usual dr doris greenblatt a psychiatrist who participated in the trial at emory said she sought the surgery because her epilepsy had long caused memory problems each seizure i had tore at the fabric of memory and it was as if my memories weren t attached to anything dr greenblatt said,1
army veteran vivian cooke has long struggled with debilitating depression she has tried alternative therapies and medication to cope with her symptoms it wasn t effective some side effects would be headaches or stomachache she told cbs news then three years ago she decided to try something different after hearing about a study testing botox to treat depression while botox is commonly used for cosmetic purposes doctors say the reasoning behind the treatment for depression may not be what you expect we don t believe it has anything to do with looks says researcher dr eric finzi of chevy chase cosmetic center rather he says it s because facial expressions are part of the circuit of the brain related to mood fear anger and sadness all go through this muscle finzi told cbs news pointing out the area between the eyebrows where frown lines appear so botox basically inhibits the muscle and calms it down so it becomes more difficult to feel those negative emotions the makers of botox recently announced plans for the final phase of testing it as a treatment for depression finzi notes previous studies show between to percent of patients may benefit from the treatment our hope is eventually it will form a place as one of the tools to treat depression he said botox is a prescription drug that blocks nerve signals to muscles in the injection area its effects are temporary and typically wear off after three months botox is currently fda approved for cosmetic use to lessen frown lines and for medical use to treat a number of conditions including chronic migraines bladder incontinence excessive underarm perspiration and certain types of neck pain and eye issues costs vary widely but the american society for aesthetic plastic surgery said the average price for a botox treatment in was researchers are also studying whether botox can treat social anxiety and bipolar disorder as for cooke she said she noticed a change in her depression almost immediately i found overall my mood was better on a day to day basis she said i had less problems with depression even though the study she took part in is now over she said she will continue to get botox injections,1
dr maximilian muenke has a superpower he can diagnose disease just by looking at a person s face specifically he can spot certain genetic disorders that make telltale impressions on facial features once you ve done it for a certain amount of years you walk into a room and it s like oh that child has williams syndrome he said referring to a genetic disorder that can affect a person s cognitive abilities and heart advertisement and that s an incredibly useful skill even as genetic sequencing becomes more widespread for one thing it can be the factor that sends someone to get a genetic test in the first place for another people in many parts of the world don t have access to genetic tests at all that s inspired years of effort to train a computer to do the same thing software that analyzes a patient s face for signs of disease could help clinicians better diagnose and treat people with genetic syndromes some older attempts at facial analysis relied on large clunky scanners a tool better suited to a lab not the field now in the era of smartphones such efforts have a whole new promise face gene a program developed by boston based startup fdna has a mobile app that clinicians can use to snap photos of their patients and get a list of syndromes they might have meanwhile muenke and his colleagues at the nih last month published an important advance the ability to diagnose disease in a non caucasian face it s a promising preliminary sign but if facial recognition software is to be widely useful for diagnoses software developers and geneticists will need to work together to overcome genetics systemic blind spots diagnoses vs probabilities the algorithms in general work on the same principles measuring the size of facial features and their placement to detect patterns they re both trained on databases of photographs doctors take of their patients the nih works with partners around the world to collect their photos fdna accepts photos uploaded to face gene but they differ in a key way whereas the algorithm the nih uses can predict if someone has a given genetic disorder the face gene algorithm spits out not diagnoses but probabilities the app describes photos as being a certain percent similar to photos of people with one of the disorders for which face gene has image data based on the overall look of the face as well as the presence of certain features however the app won t give clinicians a yes or no answer to the question of does my patient have a genetic disorder that s intentional face gene is meant to be more like a search engine for diseases a means to an end we are not a diagnostic tool and we will never be a diagnostic tool said fdna ceo dekel gelbman drawing that bright line between face gene and a diagnostic tool allows fdna to stay compliant with fda regulations governing mobile medical apps while avoiding some of the regulatory burden associated with smartphone based diagnostic tools diversity needed the algorithm the nih uses developed by scientists at children s national health system in washington d c seems to work pretty well so far in cases of down syndrome it accurately detected the disorder percent of the time for digeorge syndrome the numbers were even higher it had a percent accuracy rate across all cases face gene declined to provide similar numbers for their technology since face gene is a search and reference informational tool the terms sensitivity and specificity are difficult to apply to our output gelbman cautioned but there s one big stumbling block for both of them a problem that has dogged medical genetics for decades data for non white populations is sorely lacking in every single textbook the ones we had when i trained in germany and the major textbooks here in the us there are photos of individuals of northern european descent muenke said when i told this to my boss he said there have to be atlases for children from diverse backgrounds and there aren t there just aren t today there is that resource based on muenke and the nih s work so diagnosing diseases from a face alone presents an additional challenge in countries where the majority of the population isn t of northern european descent because some facial areas that vary with ethnic background can often overlap with areas that signify a genetic disorder eventually the software will also have to be able to tackle people with mixed ethnic backgrounds too we have thought about it but haven t gone there yet muenke said for example children with down syndrome often have flat nasal bridges as do typically developing african or african american children across different races and ethnicities of children there were only two reliable identifiers that could be used to diagnose down syndrome the angles between landmark points on the child s nose and eye according to a paper muenke and marius linguraru at children s national published with their colleagues earlier this year all of the other typical features weren t significantly more likely to show up when children were compared to ethnically matched controls in fact using a caucasian face as a reference can sometimes be the least representative choice one of the findings that i m very interested in in our recent study was that the population that we found to be most different from the others in terms of facial patterns characteristic of digeorge syndrome was the caucasian population linguraru said to continue to fix this problem both the nih and face gene need help from more researchers who can upload more patients faces but that s easier said than done confirming a suspected disorder with genetic tests is standard practice today and there are no genetic labs based in africa registered in the nih s genetic testing registry asia and south america are also relatively underserved those numbers also reflect the general patterns of distribution for medical geneticists most practitioners are located in north america and europe gelbman said nigeria for example doesn t have a single medical geneticist in the entire country it s possible that might change with time and effort in addition to his work as a researcher muenke directs a program that brings health care professionals from developing countries to the us for a month long crash course in medical genetics the program is funded by the nih s fogarty international center president trump eliminated funding for the center in his skinny budget proposal announced in march newsletters sign up for morning rounds your daily dose of news in health and medicine please enter a valid email address privacy policy leave this field empty if you re human for now both algorithms have shown that they can handle a diverse patient set fdna scientists published a paper in january showing that their algorithm could better identify down syndrome after being trained with a more diverse set of faces and muenke and linguraru have also published papers this year demonstrating their algorithm s ability to identify genetic disorders correctly in children across a variety of ethnic backgrounds as both groups work on recruiting more researchers they are also working to push their tech forward fdna is working on establishing partnerships with pharmaceutical companies to start their commercial outreach in theory these partnerships could contribute to precision medicine efforts or help companies develop new therapies for rare diseases meanwhile linguraru has his eyes on eventual fda approval for the algorithm the nih has used the ultimate goal would be a simple tool that any doctor could use anywhere to get fast results and better diagnose their patients,1
by amy norton healthday reporter wednesday april healthday news scientists report another step in the use of stem cells to help treat people with debilitating heart failure in an early study of patients japanese researchers used patients own muscle stem cells to create a patch that was placed on the heart over the next year the patients generally showed small improvements in their symptoms including the ability to walk without becoming breathless and fatigued however experts cautioned that while the results are encouraging there s a lot of work left ahead before stem cells can be used to treat heart failure they ve shown that this approach is feasible said dr eiran gorodeski a heart failure specialist at the cleveland clinic in ohio but it s not clear whether the stem cell tactic was actually effective said gorodeski who was not involved in the study that s because the study didn t include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells so it s possible gorodeski explained that the modest symptom improvements would have happened anyway all of the patients were on standard medications and some had heart devices implanted stem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body s tissues in the past years or so scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure heart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body it often arises after a heart attack symptoms of heart failure include fatigue breathlessness and swelling in the limbs the condition cannot be cured although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms in the new study the researchers used stem cells from the patients own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart that s in contrast to many past studies where researchers have injected stem cells often from patients bone marrow into the heart the patch tactic could have some advantages said senior researcher dr yoshiki sawa of osaka university he said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period compared to injections to test the safety of the approach sawa s team recruited patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies the scientists extracted stem cells from each patient s thigh muscle then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet the sheet was placed on each patient s heart the tactic appeared safe the researchers said and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart it s not clear sawa acknowledged the stem cells don t grow into new heart muscle cells instead sawa explained they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart the theory he said is that hibernating cells in the heart muscle can then function better still it s too soon to know what the new findings mean said gorodeski this type of trial called phase is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy gorodeski said it takes later phase trials where some patients receive the treatment and others do not to prove that a therapy actually works those trials are underway sawa said other studies are further along last year researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure patients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year versus those given standard treatment only but the study was small and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients heart function so it s not clear why the stem cell patients fared better gorodeski said for now he stressed all stem cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental there s no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now gorodeski said the message for patients he added is that heart failure can be treated and researchers are looking for innovative ways to improve that treatment the study was published april in the journal of the american heart association more information the american heart association has more on heart failure,1
cnn an aspirin a day may keep the doctor away it may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer according to a study on long term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer yin cao an instructor in the medicine clinical and translational epidemiology unit at massachusetts general hospital and harvard medical school presented the information monday at the american association for cancer research meeting in washington cao looked at data from over women who were part of the nurses health study between and and over men who were part of the health professionals follow up study from to over that year period over women and nearly men died of cancer the risk of death overall was lower for women and for men who took aspirin regularly compared with those who did not the risk of dying from cancer was lower for women and lower for men who took aspirin regularly compared with those who didn t take a regular dose the strongest connection was with colorectal cancer there was a lower risk for women and for men who were among regular aspirin takers as other studies have showed but it also lowered women s risk of dying from breast cancer by and men s risk of dying from prostate cancer by men s risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality cao said it is good to remember though if a person wants to take a low dose aspirin especially if a person has had cancer they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first not everyone can take aspirin particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people rulla tamimi the epidemiology chair for the american association for cancer research annual meeting thought the presentation was a beneficial one particularly since scientists are trying to better understand drugs we may all have in our medicine cabinets there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs tamimi said in an emailed statement this study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death the study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders therefore the findings are believed to be very robust and suggest that aspirin which is widely available cheap and has limited toxicity has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast colon lung and prostate cancer studies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had or are at high risk for a heart attack or stroke and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain even the ancient egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago in april the us preventive service task force said in a final recommendation statement that taking a regular low dose aspirin a day may prevent colon cancer and cardiovascular disease for adults between and who have a or greater risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter cao hopes her study will continue to broaden the body of research to include cancer related deaths overall next her group hopes to study what specific groups may most benefit from this practice particularly based on those individuals with varying cancer risk,1

there s another type of prescription drugs besides opioid painkillers that s involved in thousands of drug overdose deaths in the us every year the drugs are benzodiazepines which are widely known by their brand names xanax and valium and commonly prescribed to help treat anxiety these drugs were involved in nearly overdose deaths in according to federal data but there s a catch such overdoses seem to be very closely tied to the opioid epidemic with the majority of benzodiazepine overdose deaths involving both benzodiazepines and opioids a new study published in bmj looked at just how much the concurrent use of these two drugs increases the risk of overdose versus the risk of only using opioids drawing on a huge sample of nearly patients who were continuously enrolled in private health insurance plans from and researchers compared those who were prescribed just opioids versus those who were prescribed both and what their additional risk of an emergency room visit or inpatient admission was in the period they were prescribed both the study found that among all opioid users concurrent use of benzodiazepines more than doubled the risk of an emergency room or inpatient visit for a drug overdose the study also found that eliminating concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid use could reduce the risk for an opioid overdose related emergency room or inpatient visit by percent if that reduced risk applies to overdose deaths as well eliminating concurrent opioid and benzodiazepine use could have prevented up to opioid painkiller related overdose deaths in keith humphreys a drug policy expert at stanford university and one of the authors of the study said this reveals an underappreciated policy lever for reducing drug overdoses making sure patients prescribed to opioids aren t also prescribed to benzodiazepines and vice versa even if we didn t change opioid prescribing at all the data here suggest that we could cut overdoses dramatically just by getting prescribers to not put people on a benzodiazepine at the same time humphreys said yet the study suggests the opposite has happened from to co prescriptions to opioids and benzodiazepines among the studied pool of patients increased from percent to percent a nearly percent jump for some patients eliminating these co prescriptions could involve some tough trade offs if someone genuinely suffers from pain and anxiety doctors and patients will need to work out which condition is more important to treat and which one can be treated with alternatives to avoid a potentially deadly overdose hopefully while keeping in mind that there s no good scientific evidence that opioids can treat chronic pain so opioids aren t the right treatment for chronic pain in the first place there are some caveats to the study for one emergency room visits and inpatient admissions for opioid overdoses likely aren t a perfect one to one proxy for overdoses that didn t involve a trip to a doctor the study also only looked at legally prescribed opioid painkillers and benzodiazepines missing the effects of concurrent use of illegally obtained pills or drugs and since the research relied on patients who were continuously insured throughout the study period it s possible the findings don t exactly apply to people with spottier coverage although sensitivity analyses in the study for people who had lapses in insurance produced similar results finally since the study looked at correlation not causation it s possible that it missed some other factor driving up overdose deaths among concurrent benzodiazepine and opioid users perhaps for whatever reason these users may be more likely to misuse their drugs still it s well established that benzodiazepine and opioids compound each other s overdose risk so it s not really controversial to conclude that simultaneously using opioids and benzodiazepines dramatically increases the risk of drug overdose or conversely that stopping the concurrent use of these two drugs could reduce the risk of overdose given that the opioid epidemic has quickly turned into the deadliest drug crisis in us history it s important and potentially lifesaving for doctors and policymakers to at least consider the study s findings for more on the opioid epidemic read vox s in depth explainer the abridged explainer or the maps and charts explainer,1
what would happen if screening for male infertility was just about as easy as taking a pregnancy test in your home bathroom that s the question researchers at brigham and women s hospital and massachusetts general hospital tried to answer when they went about developing a smartphone based test that men could use to test their semen in the comfort of their homes the test delivered impressive results identifying abnormal semen samples with approximately percent accuracy according to the researchers who published their findings wednesday in the journal science translational medicine infertility affects up to percent of the male population worldwide though it s as common as female infertility it often goes unrecognized due to factors like cultural stigma the high cost and time required for testing and access to laboratory facilities as things stand now men have to provide samples in these specific rooms in hospitals under so much stress and embarrassment the study s principal investigator hadi shafiee phd told cbs news his team s new approach aims to change that with a simple and inexpensive at home test option the smartphone based test involves several distinct parts one a disposable device on which to place the sample including a disposable microchip that handles the sample two an optical attachment that connects to a smartphone three an app that guides the user through each step of testing the researchers say the optical attachment could be created by d printing and the device would only cost about the testing kit also includes a tiny weight scale that connects wirelessly to the testing app and measures the total number of sperm swimming in the sample the march cover of the journal science translational medicine depicts a smartphone based test for male infertility gilank bara verdana ravastra design studio science translational medicine the researchers tested the device on clinical semen specimens in massachusetts including both trained and untrained users in their trial the accuracy of this approach was very similar to that of computer assisted laboratory analysis even when it was performed by untrained users with no clinical background they wrote in the study the app is similar to a fitness tracker in a sense in that it stores any history of previous semen samples as well the app s user experience is hard to forget users can see vivid moving images of their sperm right on the screen though the system is in the prototyping stage it could eventually shake up the world of fertility testing by allowing men to evaluate their sperm in their own homes and helping health centers with fewer resources offer easy cheap testing in addition the developers say it could also potentially be used by men who have had a vasectomy to monitor their progress at home following surgery currently they re required to make office visits to a urologist for several months to ensure that the operation was successful shafiee s team plans to continue refining the test and then file for approval from the food and drug administration fda several other home based tests are already on the market but boston researchers say their version can analyze additional aspects of the sample checking how well the sperm move known as motility as well as their concentration male infertility has a range of root causes from low or abnormal sperm production to blockages to illness,1
many americans would rather take a drug than change their habits to control a persistent ailment yet every medication has side effects some of which can be worse than the disease they are meant to treat drugs considered safe when first marketed can turn out to have hazards both bothersome and severe that become apparent only after millions of people take them for a long enough time such is the case with a popular class of drugs called proton pump inhibitors or p p i s now used by more than million americans and many more people worldwide to counter an increasingly common ailment acid reflux which many people refer to as heartburn or indigestion these medications are now linked to a growing number of complications ranging in seriousness from nutrient deficiencies joint pain and infections to bone fractures heart attacks and dementia while definitive evidence for most of the risks identified thus far is lacking consumers plagued by acid reflux would be wise to consider an alternative approach namely diet and lifestyle changes that can minimize symptoms and even heal damage already done acid reflux is more than just a nuisance it involves the backward flow of stomach acid into the tissues above it it results when the lower esophageal sphincter a ring of muscle between the esophagus and the stomach fails to close tightly enough to prevent the contents of the stomach from moving up instead of down sometimes the upper sphincter between the esophagus and the throat malfunctions as well,1
taking statins the day of a coronary artery bypass operation may significantly improve survival a study in the annals of thoracic surgery found researchers looked at heart surgery patients most of whom were taking cholesterol lowering statins the who continued statins up to the day of surgery had a risk of death within days of percent compared with percent for who stopped one to three days before surgery and percent for who did not take statins or stopped more than hours before their operations the scientists had no data on how long patients had been taking statins but only on when they stopped after controlling for many preoperative health and behavioral characteristics they found that compared with other patients those who took statins on the day of surgery had a percent reduced risk of dying in the next days we already knew that people on statins before surgery had a decreased risk of death said a co author dr yi deng an assistant professor of anesthesiology at baylor college of medicine but there s never before been data saying how harmful stopping shortly before surgery can be unless you have some other reason to stop them you should take statins right up to the morning of surgery,1

reuters health improvement or worsening of chest pain symptoms and quality of life after a ct scan of the heart may depend on what the scan finds a large study suggests siemens logo is pictured on a ct scan in the manufacturing plant of siemens healthineers in forchheim near nuremberg germany october reuters michaela rehle people who have coronary artery disease ruled out by the scan benefit and so do those with severe blockages diagnosed while those who have moderate artery disease confirmed may only become more anxious after the scan researchers found computed tomography coronary angiography ctca is a high resolution x ray of the heart that can be used to diagnose the reason for angina or chest pain symptoms and clarify what other treatments might be needed patients with normal coronary arteries or those with severe coronary artery disease seemed to get the most benefit in quality of life and did best senior study author dr david e newby from university bhf center for cardiovascular science in edinburgh told reuters health this suggests that being reassured that all is normal is highly valued by patients and ctca really helps provide this reassurance conversely knowing the cause of your symptoms is due to coronary heart disease and patients undergo treatment for it is also very helpful he said by email although getting ctca is associated with a lower likelihood of having a heart attack later on its effects on symptoms and quality of life may vary the researchers note in the journal heart newby and his team assessed how ctca affected symptoms and quality of life six weeks and six months after the scan for patients with suspected angina due to coronary heart disease when the ctca results revealed something less than a blockage so called nonobstructive disease as the cause for the patient s chest pain patients quality of life got worse in the following weeks and months this reflects the fact that the cause of the symptoms had been unknown before and in addition they now have heart artery disease that needs treatment newby said the findings were similar when it came to changes in symptoms during follow up improvements in symptoms were greatest in patients diagnosed with normal coronary arteries or who had their medications discontinued and least in those with moderate nonobstructive disease or who received new prescriptions although ctca removes diagnostic uncertainty and halves the rate of subsequent heart attacks quality of life can be negatively impacted in those who are worried about their health and are found to have nonobstructive coronary artery disease newby said much like screening tests for cancer being told you have heart disease does not make the patient feel better he added if a doctor is faced with a patient who is already on an aspirin and statin with an unconfirmed and questionable clinical diagnosis of angina due to coronary heart disease he said then ctca would be useful because finding normal heart anatomy means that more invasive testing can be avoided treatment could be stopped and quality of life improved if however a patient presents with atypical symptoms and is on no therapy then the clinician needs to discuss with the patient the implications of potential ctca findings including nonobstructive disease that would mandate life long preventative therapy newby said certainly this is something we now discuss in more detail with our patients some of whom have declined ctca it was striking for me that health status was very much related to receiving a treatable diagnosis or excluding such a diagnosis rather than experiencing angina symptoms per se said dr paula m c mommersteeg from the center of research on psychology in somatic diseases tilburg university the netherlands who has investigated associations between personality traits and coronary artery disease symptoms in my opinion ctca does have added value in the diagnostic process improved decision making it is less invasive than coronary angiography cag and can provide more clarity in the cardiac symptoms experienced by patients mommersteeg concluded source bit ly ledxav heart online february,1
deep sleep is critical to maintaining a robust memory but both decline with age a small new study published in frontiers in human neuroscience suggests that one easy way for older adults to get deeper sleep and stronger memories is to listen to a certain soothing sound called pink noise a mix of high and low frequencies that sounds more balanced and natural than its better known cousin white noise it may sound strange but previous studies have found that playing so called pink noise during sleep improves the memory of younger adults we wanted to see if it would work in older people too says senior author dr phyllis zee professor of neurology at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine older people tend to get less slow wave sleep and are at greater risk for memory impairment zee and her fellow researchers had adults ages and older spend two nights in a sleep lab on both nights the participants took a memory test at night went to sleep wearing headphones and an electrode cap and repeated the memory test in the morning on one of those nights headphone clad participants were played a series of short bursts of pink noise during deep sleep spaced out enough to prevent the brain from getting used to and ignoring them the noise is fairly pleasant it kind of resembles a rush of water says zee it s just noticeable enough that the brain realizes it s there but not enough to disturb sleep the sounds were timed to match their slow wave oscillations no noise was played during the other night here s what pink noise sounded like to study participants in the box below after analyzing everyone s sleep waves the team found that people s slow wave oscillations increased on the nights punctuated by pink noise come morning people who had listened to it performed three times better on memory tests than they had the other night on the nights without the noise memory recall did not improve as much health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning

is all in the timing the effect here at least for memory is quite related to the ability of the sound stimulus to enhance slow wave sleep she says that s very much tied to what part of the slow wave the stimulus is hitting on that doesn t mean there aren t benefits to other soothing background sounds music nature sounds and white or pink noise apps may still help improve sleep she says which in

exercising by doing interval training not weight lifting could be the secret to staying young according to a new study published tuesday in the medical journal cell metabolism high intensity aerobic interval training or exercising in bursts of moderate and high intensity running cycling or other aerobic activity may help to reduce the effects of aging at a cellular level researchers found scientists analyzed three groups of people who were exercising by doing high intensity aerobic interval training resistance training or a combination of the two over the course of a week period while scientists found that all three types of exercise improved participants lean body mass at a cellular level they found that the group participating in the high intensity interval training also saw improvements in the exercise capacity of their muscle s mitochondria as people age their mitochondria which are responsible for producing energy for your cells become less efficient high intensity interval training essentially reversed many age related differences in aspects of elderly participants mitochondria the researchers wrote in the study s summary dr richard besser abc news chief health and medical editor called the study s findings very interesting when they looked at the cellular level the changes they saw in the older people s cells with the high intensity training made those cells look more like younger people s cells in terms of how they handled energy besser said today on good morning america that was very interesting chris powell trainer and transformation specialist on abc s extreme weight loss said the term high intensity interval training can be terrifying to people but it should not be high intensity interval training is just aerobic training with short bouts of weight training in between powell said today on gma the beauty of it though is that we get to control the throttle of our own workouts he continued it doesn t matter if you re an elite athlete or you haven t moved for years it s all about completing not competing besser advised people to consult with their medical doctor before beginning any new exercise regimen including high intensity interval training this training also known as hiit can be done using just your own body weight and with minimal to no equipment according to powell aerobic training can be accomplished by jump roping running in place or doing jumping jacks or high knees the trainer said weight training can be done with exercises such as push ups lunges and back squats powell demonstrated a hiit workout of high knees combined with back lunges it s that simple he said there s a million different combinations you can do it so many different ways,1
parents of children with autism take note it may be possible to predict autism in infants as young as months who have older siblings with the disorder according to a new study by a national network of researchers infants in such families are at increased risk of developing autism which is typically diagnosed when a child is to years old and develops symptoms such as challenges with social skills repetitive behaviors delayed speech or nonverbal communication researchers used magnetic resonance imaging or mri to scan the brains of infants when they were months months and months old two thirds of the infants were high risk having an older sibling with autism the scans showed that percent of high risk toddlers diagnosed with autism at age had an elevated amount of cerebrospinal fluid around their brains at and months compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism cerebrospinal fluid is a clear colorless liquid that bathes the brain and spine on the right mri of a baby at months who was diagnosed with autism at years the dark space between the brain folds and skull indicate increased amounts of cerebrospinal fluid on the left mri of a baby who was not diagnosed with autism at age note the decreased amount of csf unc health care unc school of medicine this excess fluid could possibly be an early biological marker for autism said mark shen the lead author of the article published in biological psychiatry and a post doctoral fellow at the university of north carolina s carolina institute for developmental disabilities additional studies are needed to confirm the finding he said trending stories celebrity news and all the best of today this site is protected by recaptcha privacy policy terms of service such a marker would allow doctors to identify infants at high risk of developing autism before symptoms are present the earlier we can get biological markers for autism the earlier intervention can be initiated and the greater the chance of better outcomes said david kennedy ph d co director of the child and adolescent neurodevelopment initiative at the university of massachusetts medical school typically therapists work with children and parents to improve eye contact social interactions and communication skills related see the special bond between a boy with autism and a deaf shelter dog the study results are very exciting said dr adriania di martino a professor of child and adolescent psychiatry at nyu medical school excess brain fluid may be more than an early marker for autism di martino said it may also be a mechanism in the development of autism and it opens up new possibilities for research she said you can start thinking about conditions that might lead to increased cerebrospinal fluid shen and his colleagues are already looking for genes associated with excess brain fluid normally the liquid refreshed four times a day washes away byproducts that build up in the brain but if the fluid is not flowing properly these byproducts hang around and cause inflammation which could hamper brain development and lead to autism said shen completely different mechanisms may be at work for kids without an older sibling with autism said shen and dimartino more studies are needed they said related de niro says find the truth on vaccines but scientists already did parents with children with autism should not rush to their pediatrician demanding brain mris for younger siblings shen said we wouldn t recommend that every high risk infant get an mri until we know that the accuracy can be improved closer to the percent range from the current percent shen told today he and his colleagues are working on improving accuracy by combining their brain fluid findings with other recent research in addition to flushing out the brain s garbage brain fluid also delivers signals to the brain that tell it how and when to grow in a study published last month in nature percent of infants diagnosed with autism as toddlers had an increased rate of growth in the surface area of their brains in their first year compared to toddlers who were not diagnosed with autism we re going to combine those two markers to see if we can improve the prediction closer to the percent range where it could be really clinically useful said shen about in children develop autism in the united states according to the centers for disease control and prevention but as many as out of infants with an older sibling with autism will develop the disorder said di martino,1

a medicine that blunts the buzz of alcohol can help drinkers cut back enlarge this image maria fabrizio for npr maria fabrizio for npr if you drink more alcohol than you want to or should you re not alone a nationwide survey by the national institutes of health found that percent of adults in the u s are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended yet most heavy drinkers don t get the help they need the biggest problem we have in the field is that less than percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever says george koob director of the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism part of the challenge researchers say is that many drinkers don t realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back too i thought my only option was aa john tells npr we ve agreed to use only his middle name disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly he says would jeopardize his business he s a year old professional who says he started out as a social drinker a few beers with his softball team after a game but he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family and sought solace in the bottle he says i wanted to numb my thoughts says john he d often start with hard liquor in the morning john says and it wasn t uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day he worked from home so he was able to mask the problem for a while but eventually his wife confronted him she had come home and i was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me he recalls just absolutely furious he went to see paula desanto a therapist and director of minnesota alternatives in spring lake park minn the center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services i would say john s story is not unique desanto tells us a lot of people are reluctant sometimes traditional treatments such as residential rehab or a step program like alcoholics anonymous can lead to a significant disruption in their lives she explains there s stigma shame and embarrassment desanto suggested a different approach to john to help work through the loss and grief he was feeling counseling can help she told him she also recommended he try naltrexone a prescription drug naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders says koob he points to a recent meta analysis published in the journal addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol the analysis included data from clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment the analysis also found that another drug acamprosate is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit so how does naltrexone work the drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol naltrexone can help people drink less it blunts the effects of alcohol says koob people who use naltrexone will say they have a drink and it s not doing much for them that was exactly john s experience after taking the naltrexone pill he didn t get the buzz he was used to getting so didn t want to keep drinking i actually didn t feel the alcohol s effects he says it was startling it s now been about five months since he started taking the medication he has not stopped drinking completely but says he has cut way back this is helping me john says i can go out with friends and not worry that i m going to end up inebriated or sloppy according to the findings of a recent review both naltrexone and acamprosate are safe cost effective and efficacious but they are substantially underused according to the review many physicians are unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders says koob his institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front he says and is also touting rethinking drinking a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research based information on a range of treatment options any health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists as as long ago as a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective follow up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works but makes treatment much more accessible according to the niaaa patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support naltrexone is certainly not a cure all researchers say and it won t help everyone who has a drinking problem especially if the disorder is severe i use these medications as an adjunct to therapy and group sessions and step meetings says dr jeffrey hsu a psychiatrist at johns hopkins university who is certified in addiction medicine he says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective but there s good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking or move toward abstinence,1

yvonne felix s eyes don t work well enough on their own for her to read recognize faces or cross the street without help but when the toronto based artist and mother puts on a new kind of camera equipped headgear she looks at me like no one has before the visor that allows legally blind people to see is no longer star trek fiction leaps in augmented reality technology are being used to help people with severely low vision gain back enough sight to function and then some ms felix who has stargardt disease wears a device from a company called esight the esight which weighs less than a quarter of a pound and is operated by hand held remote captures the world through a camera system and then displays it on oled screens that sit very close to the eyes legally blind people like ms felix have some limited vision and esight s displays are tuned to make use of it by dialing up contrast and allowing users to zoom in it can dramatically amplify sight without a surgical procedure being able to see that people s pupils actually dilate and contract is quite amazing she says the gear has allowed ms felix to get a desk job and travel on her own she s also become a spokeswoman for esight efforts to make noninvasive vision tech started decades ago with bulky tv like devices that magnify and increase the contrast on books in the s nasa developed space goggles with a camera and two black and white cathode ray tube screens to star trek fans this system recalls the blind next generation series character who wore a vision visor i remember thinking that geordi la forge was my hero and that one day there would be something like that and when it came out i wanted to try it says ms felix who is the esight visor in development for years is reaching a level of maturity the third generation which debuts this week weighs less has a wider field of view and just looks cooler esight along with other makers of head mounted low vision aids such as orcam and nu eyes is taking advantage of tech that is cheaper smaller and faster because of popular gadgets like smartphones and virtual reality headsets the camera equipped esight which weighs less than a quarter of a pound uses vr like displays to bring images close to the user s eyes photo emily prapuolenis the wall street journal when ms felix allowed me to try on her visor the images i saw were very high contrast and the screens were positioned to allow me to also make use of my natural peripheral vision the battery lasts about ½ hours using the hand held controller users can zoom and pan like on a street sign or plug in a tv feed directly because of those capabilities ms felix said in some cases esight probably lets her see better than me there is no device that s a magic solution for all problems says walter wittich an assistant professor at the university of montreal s school of optometry who is part of the first independent research project into the tech still mr wittich says it can be useful for the people with low vision who benefit from magnification for whom most current options are hand held not everyone feels equally comfortable operating the gear mr wittich plans to release initial results from the study in may and says one thing that is clear is that people who click with esight immediately see a boost in quality of life it is working very well for some people already and there is still quite a bit of potential in both the design and electronic capability he says esight says its tech has worked for about three quarters of the people who have tried it their biggest hurdle is getting the technology paid for they have sold about a thousand to date and this new visor costs while the device has fda clearance as a class i medical device most insurance doesn t cover it that is a battle we are starting to wage says esight chief executive brian mech some employers and other third parties have picked up the tab he says but the challenge is to reach users who have limited resources because their vision challenges keep them from work the esight handheld controller lets the user zoom in or pan across signs and other objects photo emily prapuolenis the wall street journal yes that is an expensive piece of equipment but it can really do a lot for people says gislin dagnelie an associate professor of ophthalmology at johns hopkins and an adviser to the company while the national federation of the blind estimates there are million legally blind people living in the u s mr dagnelie thinks at least a hundred thousand people could benefit from esight s tech for an artist like ms felix it has offered more than routine improvement she worked for decades in sculpture and thick paint because she felt her work as much as she saw it her favorite artist was vincent van gogh because he also likely suffered from vision problems she recalls the first time she saw starry night with her esight visor on it made her cry i saw every little stroke when i saw the color mixtures

cassandra quave an emory university scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains the mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts those that didn t receive the extracts developed skin lesions but in the other mice the extracts a mixture of chemicals prevented skin lesions from forming ad ad instead of destroying the bacteria the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue the extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another it weakens the bacteria so the mouse s own defenses work better to clear the infection she said the plant extracts didn t harm the skin tissues or the normal healthy bacteria found on skin the discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial resistant infections an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high level united nations summit last fall ad mrsa has become a serious threat to human health in it was responsible for more than invasive infections and more than deaths in the united states according to federal statistics ad antimicrobial resistance refers to infections that have evolved the ability to withstand drugs that ought to stop them the medicines include antibiotics which act on bacteria as well as drugs to fight fungal viral or parasitic infections fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become superbugs but instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection there are situations where using an anti virulence method may be just as effective while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient said quave plants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation which points to their efficacy she said ad ad people don t save that knowledge over centuries if something doesn t work she said we re trying to answer the question does this work against bacteria and how does it work and is it safe to use the brazilian peppertree a shrubby tree native to south america is an invasive species throughout the southern united states particularly in florida where it s sometimes called the florida holly or broad leaf peppertree and is considered a noxious weed the woody plant has long been a staple in brazilian traditional medicine its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds ulcers burns and skin infections quave said less is known about the plant s fruit which was used traditionally as topical poultices for infected wounds and ulcers ad from an ecological standpoint quave said it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment ad but she said the average person shouldn t try to use the weed to make their own medicine not everything that is natural is safe she said her lab at emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract researchers would still need to conduct pre clinical trials to test its medicinal benefits read more ad,1
bariatric surgery is probably the most effective intervention we have in health care says laurie k twells a clinical epidemiologist at memorial university of newfoundland she bases this bold claim on her experience with seriously obese patients and a detailed analysis of the best studies yet done showing weight loss surgery s ability to reverse the often devastating effects of being extremely overweight on health and quality of life i haven t come across a patient yet who wouldn t recommend it dr twells said in an interview most say they wish they d done it years sooner she explained that the overwhelming majority of patients who undergo bariatric surgery have spent many years trying and failing to lose weight and keep it off and the reason is not a lack of willpower these patients have lost hundreds of pounds over and over again dr twells said the weight that it takes them one year to lose is typically back in two months often because a body with longstanding obesity defends itself against weight loss by drastically reducing its metabolic rate an effect not seen after bariatric surgery which permanently changes the contours of the digestive tract in reviewing studies that followed patients for five to years after weight loss surgery dr twells and colleagues found major long lasting benefits to the patients health and quality of life matched with comparable patients who did not have surgery those who did fared much better physically emotionally and socially they rated themselves as healthier and were less likely to report problems with mobility pain daily activities social interactions and feelings of depression and anxiety among other factors that can compromise well being,1
a commonly used drug could dramatically increase survival rates for men who have to fight prostate cancer twice the drug a type of androgen depleting therapy is a frontline treatment for men who opt not to have surgery for the cancer but the new finding indicates it could also be a valuable add on treatment to surgery if the cancer returns androgens including testosterone are thought to contribute to the growth and development of prostate cancer among men whose cancer showed signs of coming back after their prostate was surgically removed adding a drug that blocks androgen receptors to radiation treatments halved their death rate from prostate cancer over the subsequent years advertisement the findings should trickle down to clinical settings pretty quickly said dr william shipley chair of the genitourinary oncology unit at massachusetts general hospital and one of the researchers behind the study which was published wednesday in the new england journal of medicine prostate cancer recurrence happens in about percent of patients after surgery in these cases radiation therapy is usually used the specific adt drug used in the study bicalutamide has since been largely replaced by another kind of drug that decreases the amount of testosterone the body produces the effect of the newer generation medications gonadotropin releasing hormones is similar to bicalutamide according to other trials astrazeneca azn which is one of the makers of bicalutamide was a sponsor of the study and one of shipley s coauthors has received honoraria and grants from the company because prostate cancer can progress relatively slowly the study which ran from to needed an extended follow up period to be sure of the effects shipley said the men in the trial received the adt drugs for two years the study represents an important if incremental step for clinicians noted dr william see chair of the urology department at the medical college of wisconsin who wasn t involved in the study it really builds on some prior data and combines prior findings to ask and answer a new question that is quite relevant for men affected by prostate cancer some patients benefitted from adding the drugs more than others the results were especially dramatic for men who had prostate specific antigen psa levels above ng ml when they started the trial while that is a relatively low level for most men psa levels should be close to zero after a prostatectomy men with medium grade tumors and those who may not have had their entire cancer removed during surgery also survived significantly longer if they received the drug however see and shipley both noted that looking at those subsets of patients was not what the study was initially designed to do which limits the statistical power of those conclusions more research will be needed to confirm which men benefit most from taking the drug you don t want to treat a patient if he doesn t need to be treated shipley said,1

a small study claims children with autism may benefit from fecal transplants which involves introducing donated microbes into people with gastrointestinal disease to rebalance the gut the ohio state university northern arizona university and arizona state university researchers found a parallel between behavioral symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal distress and improvements to both after fecal transplant transplants are working for people with other gastrointestinal problems lead study author ann gregory a microbiology graduate student at the ohio state university said in a news release and with autism gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe so we thought this could be potentially valuable the researchers built off of previous findings that children with autism typically have fewer types of important bacteria in their guts and less bacterial diversity overall the research team surmises the disparity is due to antibiotics prescribed within the first three years of life the study which was published in the journal microbiome included children with autism and moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems the children ranged from to years old a questionnaire was used to assess social skills irritability hyperactivity and communication parents and doctors reported improvements that lasted at least eight weeks after treatment children without autism were used as a control for the study the news release reported on average the score on a scale for ranking gastrointestinal symptoms dropped percent from the beginning to the end of treatment while average developmental age increased by years according to the release researchers also asked the children s doctors to perform pre and post diagnostic evaluations which suggested lasting benefits one of the study s limitations is its small size and researchers cautioned that families should not try to replicate the treatment at home we have to be mindful of the placebo effect and we have to take the findings with a grain of salt matthew sullivan an associate professor of microbiology at the ohio state university said in the release but it does give us hope,1
by steven reinberg healthday reporter wednesday jan healthday news just how successful is the procedure called catheter ablation at fixing irregular heartbeats that can be potentially fatal pretty successful a new study found but there are caveats burning or freezing specific areas of the heart can alleviate the common irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation in percent of patients however the procedure doesn t work for everyone and there are risks of complications researchers report atrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and times in men it causes to percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations shortness of breath tiredness weakness and psychological distress the study authors explained about million americans suffer from atrial fibrillation according to the american heart association for those whose atrial fibrillation can t be controlled with medications catheter ablation may be recommended catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate said study lead researcher dr elena arbelo but the procedure can have complications which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients said arbelo a senior specialist in the cardiovascular institute at the hospital clinic of barcelona in spain complications can include fluid buildup around the heart called cardiac tamponade which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood other complications include stroke or mini stroke arbelo said in addition many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure she explained during the procedure a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber called the atrium the burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm arbelo said according to dr hugh calkins atrial fibrillation ablation is a well established procedure that has imperfect results calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at johns hopkins university in baltimore the complication rate is higher than hoped and the success rate is lower than hoped he said patients don t get a lifetime certificate saying you re cured calkins said for one in four patients atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a percent cure rate with no risk he added the new study included information from more than patients in europe the middle east and north africa their average age was and all had undergone catheter ablation ablation was successful in percent of patients arbelo said these patients had no atrial arrhythmias irregular heart beats for three to months after the procedure according to arbelo percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms while percent do so to improve their quality of life atrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures arbelo said in addition percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs months later about percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation she said after the procedure patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners while those with no risk factors don t need them arbelo suggested the study investigators found that percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners but one third of low risk patients were taking them dr gregg fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the university of california los angeles he said relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging in certain patients catheter ablation may reduce symptoms improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated he noted of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure and there was suboptimal use of stroke preventing anticoagulation anti clotting therapy after the procedure added fonarow who was not involved with the study further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first line therapy he suggested catheter ablation is covered by most insurance including medicare the researchers said the report was published online recently in the european heart journal more information for more about atrial fibrillation visit the american heart association,1

en español by dennis thompson healthday reporter tuesday jan healthday news because of stringent tonsillectomy guidelines some kids who could benefit from tonsil removal surgery aren t getting it two new reviews suggest to qualify for the surgery a child must have many recurring throat infections within a short span of time or severe sleep disturbances said dr sivakumar chinnadurai a co author of the reviews an evaluation of current medical evidence suggests more kids would receive significant short term improvement in their daily life if the guidelines were relaxed said chinnadurai a pediatric otolaryngologist with vanderbilt university medical center in nashville children experienced nearly half as many sore throats when they underwent a tonsillectomy even if they didn t meet the guidelines chinnadurai and his colleagues found the kids also missed fewer days of school and were less likely to need medical care however this strong benefit only applies to the first couple of years following surgery chinnadurai said by the third year there was no clear benefit in terms of the number of throat infections also there was limited research on long term results the decision about whether those children should have tonsillectomy for that temporary benefit is really tied to what those children need or what they re suffering with chinnadurai said kids who miss a lot of school or need frequent trips to the doctor due to sore throats could benefit from the surgery he said there s an even clearer benefit for kids whose sleep is disturbed due to inflamed tonsils chinnadurai said in a child with a diagnosis of sleep apnea we can see a benefit in sleep related quality of life he said the kids get better sleep and thus exhibit better everyday behavior and pay more attention in school the medical approach to treating tonsil infections has evolved over recent decades tonsillectomy is the third most common surgery performed on u s children with such procedures completed each year according to the american academy of otolaryngology head and neck surgery thirty years ago nine out of tonsillectomies in children were performed to treat recurring throat infections these days the procedure is done percent of the time for infections and percent of the time for sleep problems according to the academy swollen tonsils can block the airway during sleep causing breathing problems that range from simple snoring to obstructive sleep apnea the researchers said in background notes guidelines say a tonsillectomy to treat throat infections is justified if a child had seven or more sore throats during the previous year five or more sore throats two years running or three or more sore throats for three years in a row according to the background notes the researchers decided to review whether the throat infection guidelines are too stringent ruling out patients who potentially could benefit but don t meet the high threshold of recurring infections chinnadurai said there aren t strong guidelines regarding the use of tonsillectomy to treat sleep disorders so the doctors reviewed the evidence to see whether the surgery outperformed so called watchful waiting monitoring the situation the study results showed there may be new evidence that supports expanding the criteria and opening up the procedure to more individuals said dr alyssa hackett an otolaryngologist with the new york eye and ear infirmary of mount sinai in new york city in the right child with the right indications these are really wonderful procedures that can be life changing for both the child and the family said hackett who wasn t involved with the new research if you need your appendix out you need your appendix out hackett said but for the tonsils and adenoids there are great quality of life benefits that are evident for the surgery but no child has ever died because they haven t gone through the surgery adenoids glands at the roof of the mouth are often removed along with tonsils still chinnadurai and hackett warned against automatically choosing the surgery for every sore throat about percent of kids who undergo the procedure experience bleeding during the two week recovery period hackett said though a tonsillectomy is low risk it is not risk free and those risks need to be weighed against the benefits for each individual child chinnadurai said we re talking about a child who has significant sleep related issues hackett said we don t want people to say my child snores they need to have their tonsils out that s not what this study says at all the two reports were published online jan in the journal pediatrics more information for more on tonsillectomy visit the american academy of otolaryngology head and neck surgery,1
like spicy foods if so science has some good news for you eating hot chili peppers may help you live longer a new study published in plos one found that consumption of hot red chili peppers was associated with a percent lower risk of death the research is observational so no cause and effect relationship can be established still the authors say the study strengthens the growing body of evidence that spicy food may have protective health properties that can lead to a longer life for the study researchers at the larner college of medicine at the university of vermont analyzed data on more than americans using the national health and nutritional examination survey nhanes participants were followed for an average of years the researchers note that people who ate hot red chili peppers tended to be younger male white mexican american married and to smoke cigarettes drink alcohol and consume more vegetables and meats had lower hdl cholesterol lower income and less education in comparison to participants who did not consume red chili peppers though the mechanism by which chili peppers could help delay death is not well understood there are some theories previous mostly experimental research has suggested that spices and their bioactive ingredient capsaicin have anti obesity antioxidant anti inflammation and anti cancer properties the authors say capsaicin also possesses antimicrobial properties that may indirectly affect the host by altering the gut microbiota the research corroborates a study conducted in china and published in the bmj that found regular consumption of spicy food is associated with a lower risk of death but experts caution that this doesn t mean everyone should pile on the spices at dinner time to improve their health and increase their longevity people with gastrointestinal issues for example should hold off on the hot sauce for those who are affected by digestive disorders such as a stomach ulcer i would be cautious about eating spicy foods lu qi of harvard s t h chan school of public health and brigham and women s hospital in boston and lead author of the bmj study told cbs news the authors suggest further research should investigate the benefits of other spices and the effects of certain chili pepper subtypes such evidence may lead to new insights into the relationships between diet and health updated dietary recommendations and the development of new therapies they write,1
to the age old question is coffee bad for you researchers are in more agreement than ever that the answer is a resounding no a new study published in the journal nature medicine found that older people with low levels of inflammation which drives many if not most major diseases had something surprising in common they were all caffeine drinkers the more caffeine people consumed the more protected they were against a chronic state of inflammation says study author david furman consulting associate professor at the institute for immunity transplantation and infection at stanford university there was no boundary apparently in the study furman and his colleagues analyzed blood samples from young and old people the older people tended to have more activity in several inflammation related genes compared with the younger group no surprise since as people get older inflammation throughout the body tends to rise chronic diseases of aging like diabetes hypertension heart problems cancer joint disorders and alzheimer s are all believed to have inflammation in common most of the diseases of aging are not really diseases of aging per se but rather diseases of inflammation furman says the more active these genes were the more likely the person was to have high blood pressure and atherosclerosis what s more even among older people those with lower levels of these factors were more protected against inflammation and they had something else in common too they all drank caffeine regularly people who drank more than five cups of coffee a day showed extremely low levels of activity in the inflammatory gene pathway caffeine inhibits this circuit and turns the inflammatory pathway off the researchers say the goal isn t to make every trace of inflammation disappear the scientists stress in fact inflammation is an important function of the immune system which uses it to fight off infections and remove potentially toxic compounds but with aging the process isn t regulated as well as it is in a younger body clearly in aging something is breaking down and we become less effective at managing this inflammation says mark davis director of the stanford institute but now in this paper we identify a particular pathway that was not associated with inflammation before we are able to point with a much higher resolution picture at aging and the things that should be markers for inflammation the key will be to figure out when the inflammatory response starts to spiral out of control in an upcoming study furman and others will soon investigate the immune systems of people he hopes to use that information to develop a reference range of immune system components to tell people whether their levels are normal or if they re at higher risk for developing chronic conditions driven by inflammation in the meantime following the example of caffeine drinking adults with lower levels of inflammation by having a cup of joe or two might be a good idea contact us at,0
on a scale of to lower back pain can register somewhere between i need an aspirin to please jack me up with morphine those suffering from such discomfort might feel moderate to mild pain that is not debilitating in severe cases they could feel like a giant electrified claw has claimed the lower part of their back tearing into each nerve in that part of the body the smallest of movements getting up from a chair walking or even coughing can feel torturous maybe the lower back is as stiff as hardened concrete and as sensitive as an exposed nerve a simple lumbar support device or back brace can provide short term relief research shows according to an analysis of studies published in the september issue of the annals of physical rehabilitation medicine journal while these devices won t cure the underlying condition they re simple and relatively inexpensive in the meta analysis researchers concluded that lumbar support devices are useful for improving function and reducing pain among those suffering from subacute back pain which means it s past the acute stage which is sudden and short in duration but not long lasting enough to be chronic lumbar support devices provide enough compression and support for the lower back to allow healing to occur says christopher cousins a physical therapist based in the district of columbia the compression on the abdomen means there s less pressure on your lower back discs ligaments muscles and spine lumbar devices typically fit around your waist and are secured with velcro they often have a steel or plastic plate attached to the section that would press against the patient s lower back to provide support some have over the shoulders straps most over the counter lumbar support devices cost between and and they re available at many drug stores target and wal mart plus online without a a prescription custom made lumbar support devices which are contoured to the natural curvature of the patient s spine cost from a few hundred dollars to about cousins says people who suffer mild to moderate subacute back pain should put on a back brace as soon as their discomfort sets in says scott bautch a chiropractor in wasau wisconsin and president of the american chiropractic association s council on occupational health you want to give yourself bracing so you can move bautch says inactivity or immobilization is the worst thing for a back you want to remain active and a brace can help you do that some studies have shown that wearing a lumbar support device could lead to negative effects such as skin lesions muscle wasting gastrointestinal disorders higher blood pressure and higher heart rates those issues are rare and typically occur with people who wear a back brace for an extended period of time for more than the week or two most experts recommend bautch says if a back brace fits well is worn properly that is it s not too snug and is not overused it shouldn t create any health problems bautch says during the course of his year career bautch says hundreds of his patients have worn lumbar support devices none of them developed any problems aside from a handful who had minor skin irritation where part of the brace rubbed their body bautch says he remedied that issue by having his patients wear an undershirt between the lumbar support device and their skin searing subacute back pain is caused by an array of conditions including a herniated disc in which the soft jelly like center inside the disc pushes out through a tear in its tough exterior and irritates nerves a herniated disc can cause sciatica a painful condition that affects the back hips and legs and is caused by the compression of a spinal nerve root in the lower back spinal discs degenerate with age and a herniated disc can occur without a physical injury says dr neel anand director of spine trauma at cedars sinai medical center in los angeles think of your disc like your car tire it s going to wear out anand says before getting a lumbar support device for your lower back pain experts recommend these steps if you have severe pain see a physician quickly if your back pain or stiffness is so bad you can t move without tremendous discomfort see a doctor as soon as possible bautch says if your pain and stiffness are that severe a back brace may not be of much immediate use he says adding that it may be helpful once the pain and stiffness subside to a tolerable level where you can move moderate to mild lower back pain often subsides after five days or so but if your discomfort persists beyond that or worsens see a doctor adds dr megan cortazzo medical director of clinical documentation improvement and health information management at the university of pittsburgh medical center a doctor can test for and rule out serious potential causes such as kidney stones an abdominal aneurysm and cancer cortazzo says doctors can order an array of tests such as an x ray mri or ct scan to arrive at the correct diagnosis which will help lead to the most effective treatment plan she says the goal of most treatment regimens is strengthening the patient s core muscles supporting the spine so the pain doesn t recur treatment could include physical therapy a stretching routine yoga or pilates many people also find chiropractic adjustments helpful says robert hayden a chiropractor based in griffin georgia find a lumbar support device that fits you once you ve been diagnosed look for a lumbar support device that fits the natural curvature of your spine says dr jeremy smith an orthopedic spine surgeon at the hoag orthopedic institute in irvine california try on a few at the store before buying one he advises if you buy the device online you can return it if it doesn t fit it needs to naturally contour and fit kind of like a glove so all surface areas are in contact with your back it should help remind you to keep good posture smith says the device should be snug but not too tight it shouldn t constrict your breathing don t become reliant on your back brace patients should wear a back brace for no longer than a few days to two weeks at the most bautch says longer than that and your muscles start to adapt and get accustomed to the brace which means they can lose strength which can lead to more injuries he adds if you use the back brace for more than two weeks you can become brace dependent a lumbar support device can be useful in the short term but strengthening the core muscles that support your back is important in the long run bautch says learn your capacity figure out your physical limits to avoid reinjuring your back both when you re wearing a back brace and after you ve stopped using it says robert shapiro a physical therapist and certified orthopedic manual therapist based in huntington new york you re not superman when you re wearing your brace he says exceeding your physical boundaries could cause a recurrence of low back pain you have to learn what your limits are and not to exceed them shapiro says you may be able to lift a box of books but shoveling snow may cause pain your physical limits may change as you exercise and strengthen your core,1
using the immune system to beat cancer is quickly becoming a promising new strategy for battling tumors but most of the success so far has been with blood cancers like lymphomas and leukemias immunotherapy as it s called has yet to prove itself with solid tumors like breast prostate lung colon and brain cancers but in a report published in the new england journal of medicine researchers led by dr behnam badie from the city of hope beckman research institute and medical center say that the same immune based therapy that is successful against blood cancers also helped a patient with advanced brain cancer the year old man with glioblastoma a particularly aggressive type of brain tumor had already been treated with surgery radiation and anti tumor drug therapies despite these treatments his cancer had returned and also spread to other parts of his brain and spinal cord badie and his team extracted immune cells from him then engineered them to express proteins on their surface that would recognize and destroy glioblastoma tumor cells after surgery to remove the bulk of the brain tumor badie and his colleagues directly injected the site with the modified immune cells called chimeric antigen receptor t cells or car t cells six times and the remaining part of this tumor stopped growing other smaller growths in the brain continued to grow however so the patient received more doses of the car t cells injected into the cavities in the brain called the ventricles this is the first time that immune cells have been injected into these brain regions because introducing anything into the ventricles can cause dangerous and possibly deadly inflammation the man did not develop such serious complications however and after about four months these tumors too started to shrink by six months almost all had disappeared if the patient had not received the car t therapy he likely would only have survived a few weeks after his cancer recurred says badie but after being treated with the immune therapy his cancer did not grow or recur for nearly eight months if we can do the same for other patients that would be an amazing accomplishment that many decades of work and research on glioblastoma have never done says badie whose own father passed away a decade ago from glioblastoma health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now the patient is one of nine in the trial and so far many of the other people are having similar experiences on the therapy based on this man s case his team is hoping to now inject not just the tumor site but also the ventricular space in the brain since that may help control spread of the cancer get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you

under control for almost eight months but the cancer returned after that in new parts of the brain badie says it s not obvious why but his analysis showed that these tumors did not contain much of the protein targeted by the car t cells that were injected it s possible that the immune cells had destroyed most of the cancer cells expressing the original protein so other cancer cells with other proteins began to proliferate and survive badie is hoping to take advantage of this information and introduce immune cells with different tumor targeting proteins eventually these proteins would also be tailored to be specific to each patient s cancer a precision medicine approach to controlling cancer these results are the first encouraging sign that the immunotherapy that is helping more people with blood cancer might also be effective for people with solid tumors like brain cancers contact us at,1
wednesday dec healthday news a shorter period of antibiotic treatment for ear infections in young children does more harm than good a new study finds about three quarters of children have ear infections in their first year of life these infections are the most common reason why children are given antibiotics the university of pittsburgh researchers noted given significant concerns regarding overuse of antibiotics and increased antibiotic resistance we conducted this trial to see if reducing the duration of antibiotic treatment would be equally effective along with decreased antibiotic resistance and fewer adverse reactions dr alejandro hoberman said in a university news release hoberman is chief of the general academic pediatrics division at children s hospital of pittsburgh of upmc the study included youngsters with ear infections the children ranged in age from months to months and were randomly selected to receive either a standard day course of antibiotics or a shortened five day course of antibiotics followed by five days of placebos the risk of treatment failure was percent in the five day group and percent in the day group what s more the children in the five day group didn t have a lower risk of antibiotic resistance or of side effects such as diarrhea or diaper rash the results of this study clearly show that for treating ear infections in children between and months of age a five day course of antibiotic offers no benefit in terms of adverse events or antibiotic resistance hoberman said though we should be rightly concerned about the emergence of resistance overall for this condition the benefits of the day regimen greatly outweigh the risks he added the study was published dec in the new england journal of medicine more information the u s national institute on deafness and other communication disorders has more about ear infections in children,0
london reuters a non surgical treatment for low risk prostate cancer in which doctors inject a light sensitive drug derived from deep sea bacteria into a patient s bloodstream was shown in a trial to kill cancer cells without destroying healthy tissue results of a trial in patients showed that the drug which is activated with a laser to destroy tumor tissue in the prostate was so effective that half the patients went into remission compared with percent in a control group these results are excellent news for men with early localized prostate cancer offering a treatment that can kill cancer without removing or destroying the prostate said mark emberton a university college london consultant urologist who led the trial this is truly a huge leap forward the treatment called vascular targeted photodynamic therapy or vtp was developed by scientists at the weizmann institute of science in israel in collaboration with the privately owned steba biotech the light sensitive drug used called wst is derived from bacteria found at the bottom of the ocean to survive with very little sunlight they have evolved to convert light into energy with incredible efficiency emberton s team said in a study published in the journal lancet oncology the weizmann scientists exploited this feature to develop wst a compound that releases free radicals to kill surrounding cells when activated by laser light men with low risk prostate cancer are currently put under active surveillance where the disease is monitored and only treated when it becomes more severe radical therapy which involves surgically removing or irradiating the whole prostate has significant long term side effects so is only used to treat high risk cancers while radical therapy causes lifelong erectile problems and incontinence vtp only caused short term urinary and erectile problems which resolved within three months the researchers said no significant side effects remained after two years in the trial only percent of patients treated with vtp needed radical therapy compared with percent of patients in the control arm who were under active surveillance the trial involved treatment sites in european countries most of which were performing vtp for the first time the fact that the treatment was performed so successfully by non specialist centers in various health systems is really remarkable emberton said the vtp treatment is now being reviewed by the european medicines agency ema for possible license but it likely to be several years before it can be offered to patients more widely,0

pets help people manage the pain of serious mental illness enlarge this image toggle caption gary john norman getty images gary john norman getty images any pet owner will tell you that their animal companions comfort and sustain them when life gets rough this may be especially true for people with serious mental illness a study finds when people with schizophrenia or bipolar disorder were asked who or what helped them manage the condition many said it was pets that helped the most when i m feeling really low they are wonderful because they won t leave my side for two days one study participant with two dogs and two cats they just stay with me until i am ready to come out of it another person said of their pet birds if i didn t have my pets i think i would be on my own you know what i mean so it s it s nice to come home and you know listen to the birds singing and that you know many people with serious mental illness live at home and have limited contact with the health care system says helen brooks a mental health researcher at university of manchester in the united kingdom and the lead author on the study which was published friday in the journal bmc psychiatry so they re doing a lot of the work of managing their conditions brooks says many felt deep emotional connections with their pet that weren t available from friends and family brooks and her colleagues interviewed people with serious long term mental illnesses twenty five of them considered their pets to be a part of their social network the scientists asked who they went to when they needed help or advice where they gained emotional support and encouragement and how they spent their days the participants were then given a diagram with three consecutive circles radiating out from a square representing the participant they were asked to write the people places and things that gave them support into the circles with the circles closest to the center being the most important sixty percent of the people who considered pets to be a part of their social networks placed them in the central most important circle the same place many people put close family and social workers percent placed pets in the second circle enlarge this image toggle caption helen brooks university of manchester helen brooks university of manchester the interviews with participants are poignant and reveal the struggle and isolation that can come with mental illness i think it s really hard when you haven t had a mental illness to know what the actual experience is like said one participant there s like a chasm deep chasm between us other people are on one side of it and we re on the other side of it we re sending smoke signals to each other to try and understand each other but we don t always we don t always understand people with mental illnesses often see their social groups shrink and find themselves alienated from their friends for many of these people says brooks animals can break through the isolation they give affection without needing to understand the disorder pets don t look at the scars on your arms one participant said they don t question where you ve been the pets provided more than just emotional support and companionship participants said the animals also could distract them from their illness even from severe psychosis one study participant placed birds in his closest social circle when he was hearing voices he said that they help me in the sense you know i m not thinking about the voices i m just thinking of when i hear the birds singing another participant said that merely seeing a hamster climbing the bars on the cage and acting cute helped with some difficult situations and having to take care of pets keeps people from withdrawing from the world they force me the cats force me to sort of still be involved said one participant another said that walking the dog helped them get out of the house and with people that surprised me you know the amount of people that stop and talk to him and that yeah it cheers me up with him i haven t got much in my life but he s quite good yeah the routine these pets provide is really important for people says brooks getting up in the morning to feed them and groom them and walk them giving them structure and a sense of purpose that they won t otherwise have many of the study participants are unemployed because of their illness she notes having a pet that was well taken care of was a source of pride for them mark longsjo the program director of adult services at mclean southeast an inpatient mental facility in middleborough mass says that the interviews in the study reflect his professional experiences we have so many patients come through and we always ask them about their support system sometimes its family members sometimes its friends but it s very common to hear about pets when he does patient intake surveys longsjo says that he includes pets in their risk assessments patients with pets often say the animals help keep them from following through on suicidal thinking because they know their pets depend on them the social workers at mclean also incorporate pets into their aftercare planning encouraging patients to make walking and grooming their pets a part of their routine i think there s significant value in considering the common everyday pet to be as important as the relationships one has with one s family in the course of their treatment says longsjo he feels this study is important because although there s a lot of work looking at the benefits of trained therapy animals they can be expensive and out of the reach of many patients brooks hopes that more health workers will consider incorporating pets into care plans for people with mental illness many of her participants said that sometimes it felt like their pets could sense when they needed help the most and were able to provide it just like the owners took care of them as one person in the study said when he comes up and sits beside you on a night it s different you know it s just like he needs me as much as i need him,1
having an optimistic outlook on life may do more than just boost your mood it may actually help you live longer according to new research from the harvard t h chan school of public health the study published in the american journal of epidemiology found that women who were optimistic had a significantly lower risk of dying from several major diseases including cancer heart disease stroke and respiratory disease compared to other women whose outlook on life was less positive optimism in prior research has been shown to be related to better health behaviors and better health outcomes particularly in cardiovascular disease postdoctoral research fellow kaitlin hagan co lead author of the study told cbs news so in our study we wanted to expand that and look at all cause mortality and be able to see whether optimism improves other health behaviors that then affects mortality or whether there s an independent effect of optimism on mortality for the study the researchers analyzed data on from to on women who participated in the nurses health study a long running research project tracking women s health via surveys every two years to measure levels of optimism participants were asked to use a five point scale to either agree or disagree with six statements such as in uncertain times i usually expect the best the results showed that the most optimistic women those in the top percent had a nearly percent lower risk of dying from any of the diseases analyzed in the study when compared to the least optimistic participants in the lowest percent specifically the researchers found that the most optimistic women had a percent lower risk of dying from cancer a percent lower risk of dying from heart disease a percent lower risk of dying from stroke a percent lower risk of dying from respiratory disease the researchers controlled for a number of factors that could have had an impact on lifespan including marital status education level and other socioeconomic factors while the study is observational and cannot prove a cause and effect relationship between optimism and a longer life the researchers have some theories for what might be behind the connection it s a combination hagan said if you re more optimistic you tend to have healthier behaviors optimistic people are likely to have better diets they re exercising more and they re getting better sleep however even after the researchers accounted for these factors the results still suggest that optimism itself is linked to a longer life so it could be that optimism directly impacts our biological functioning hagan said optimism is linked with lower inflammation and healthier biomarker levels and lipid levels so there could be an independent effect on optimism she said her team plans to focus more on the potential impact of optimism on biological functioning in future research the authors point out that since the study was only done in women who were mainly white the results might not be generalizable to other populations however they note there is no clear basis for believing that the effects of optimism on health differ by sex or race finally the researchers emphasize that while some people may think they re just not optimistic it is something that is modifiable they suggested a number of steps people can take to improve their level of optimism one is called best possible self eric kim who also co led the study told cbs news so you think about your different domains of life whether it s your personal relationship your spouse your career your friendships and in each of those domains you think about the best possible outcome hagan had some suggestions too simple things like thinking about what you re grateful for every day or writing down what things make you happy or what things you re looking forward to can help someone to increase their optimism which can improve health outcomes as we ve seen here she said,1
strobe lighting has been shown to reduce levels of the toxic proteins seen in alzheimer s disease in findings that raise the tantalising possibility of future non invasive treatments for the disease the study in mice found that exposure to flickering light stimulated brain waves called gamma oscillations that are known to be disturbed in alzheimer s patients boosting this synchronous brain activity appeared to act as a cue for the brain s immune cells prompting them to absorb the sticky amyloid proteins that are the most visible hallmarks of the disease in the brain s of people with alzheimer s the authors caution that a big if remains over whether the findings would be replicated in humans and whether cognitive deficits as well as visible symptoms of the disease would be improved if humans behave similarly to mice in response to this treatment i would say the potential is just enormous because it s so non invasive and it s so accessible said li huei tsai director of the picower institute for learning and memory at mit and the paper s senior author alzheimer s research has faced a number of major setbacks most recently the failure of eli lily s drug trial after promising results in rodents did not translate into clinical improvements for patients the latest intervention scientists predict should be quicker and cheaper to confirm in humans than pharmaceuticals which typically take more than a decade to develop and assess for safety before the clinical efficacy is even examined the study published on wednesday in the journal nature hinges on the observation that alzheimer s patients show a loss of synchronised brain activity known as gamma oscillations which is linked to attention and memory to restore the activity the scientists first used mice that had been genetically engineered such that the neurons that generate gamma activity in the brain were sensitive to light the technique known as optogenetics allowed the scientists to artificially cause groups of neurons to fire in unison by pulsing light into the brains of the mice after an hour of stimulation the researchers found a roughly reduction in the levels of beta amyloid proteins in the hippocampus the brain s memory centre closer inspection showed that the amyloid had been taken up by microglia the brain s immune cells in a healthy brain microglia act as chemical rubbish collectors surveying the local environment clearing up unwanted compounds but in alzheimer s these cells can lose this function and switch into an inflammatory state in which they secrete toxic compounds instead strengthening gamma oscillations appeared to switch the microglia back into a productive state next the scientist showed that gamma oscillations could also be stimulated non invasively in the visual brain region simply by exposing the mice to a flickering light at hz the flicker of the light is barely discernible and would be not offensive at all for a person to have in the background after being given one hour of flickering light each day for a week the scientists saw a reduction of harmful amyloid plaques in the brains of the mice ed mann an associate professor of neuroscience at the university of oxford said i was surprised and it s exciting that such a simple stimulus can target a molecular pathway and have such an effect in an hour questions remain however about whether boosting gamma oscillations and sweeping amyloid plaques out of the visual brain region would help with memory which is centred in the hippocampus or broader cognitive abilities david reynolds chief scientific officer at alzheimer s research uk said it is conceivable that changing brain cell rhythms could be a future target for therapies but researchers will need to explore how light flickering approaches could not only reduce amyloid in the visual area of the brain but in those areas more commonly affected in alzheimer s the authors suggest that it may be possible to take a multi sensory approach using a combination of flashing lights and vibrating chairs tsai and ed boyden a colleague at mit and co author have started a company called cognito therapeutics to pursue tests in humans there are people with dementia in britain and this figure is expected to reach million by earlier this year dementia overtook heart disease as the leading cause of death in england and wales,1

the recommendations also support the position of the american college of cardiology and the american heart association which in radically shifted their advice from suggesting that doctors focus on the level of a patient s low density lipoproteins ldl or bad cholesterol to looking at a more comprehensive picture of risk based on things such as weight and blood pressure as well as lifestyle factors people with no signs symptoms or history of cardiovascular disease can still be at risk for having a heart attack or stroke said kirsten bibbins domingo who chairs the task force ad ad the task force which is made up of independent experts but commissioned by the government concurred after a comprehensive review of the evidence on the topic determined that a broader evaluation of risk is needed but it puts a greater emphasis on age than the acc and aha did in determining who might benefit from the medication in preventing heart attack or stroke it is also slightly more conservative when it comes to determining the benefits of taking the medications which include lipitor crestor and zocor the new guidelines published in the journal of the american medical association suggests that people ages to who have one or more risk factors such as high cholesterol high blood pressure diabetes or smoking that put them at a percent or greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke in the next years should be on statins the group also said that people with a percent to percent risk may also benefit but did not definitively recommend they take them people in this group should make an individual decision with their doctor about whether to start taking statins the task force advised ad ad in contrast the acc and aha recommend that people with a percent or greater risk take the drugs another important difference between the groups is that the task force withheld a recommendation about starting statins in adults who are and older saying that the current evidence is insufficient to assess the balance of benefits and harms in a commentary accompanying the recommendations philip greenland and robert bonow note that there is uncertainty and hesitation in the guidelines regarding older people but said it appears that it is not necessary to stop taking statins at age if you are already on them ad the task force and aha groups carry tremendous influence in medical practice and in what insurance companies will cover medicare typically follows uspstf guidelines in determining coverage and the affordable care act specifies that uspstf recommendations rated at the strongest levels must be used as a floor for coverage for private insurers in the case of statins this would apply to the use of the drug by those who are to years old with one or more risk factors for cardiovascular disease and who have a percent or greater risk but not those with to percent risk individual doctors are free to take the advice or leave it and in recent months there has been a lot of debate about what the scientific evidence really shows regarding the therapy there is a consensus among experts that people at substantial risk for heart disease benefit from statins but considerable disagreement about those at lower risk last month national institutes of health director francis collins wrote in the journal lancet that it s a force for good but rita redberg a cardiologist at the university of california at san francisco and editor of jama internal medicine and others have been vocal about their belief that the drugs are overprescribed and that the side effects which range from muscle pain and cataracts to possibly an increased risk for diabetes in women should be taken more seriously ad ad in an opinion piece sunday redberg and mitchell katz deputy editor of jama internal medicine advised everyone to take a step back and ask why this debate is so contentious they suggest that the estimates of the benefits of statins may be inflated that the drugs as an intervention are weak and that the reports of adverse events are incomplete in deciding on any therapy it is important to understand the risks and benefits particularly for healthy people they wrote the two u s guidelines are notably more aggressive in recommending drugs than reports issued by their counterparts in other parts of the world including the canadian cardiovascular society which recommends statins in men and older but only after age in women and the u k national institute for health and care excellence which recommends discussing lifestyle modification before offering statin therapy the european society of cardiology focuses more on managing ldl ad ad statins are among the best selling drugs in the united states with a study showing at least million americans were taking them the acc and aha guidelines recommend an estimated million more people should be on them the task force s recommendations come on the heels of an important new study published saturday that shows that people who use statins survive heart attacks better than those who do not they are more likely to not only get to the hospital and survive until they are discharged but also survive in greater numbers a year after their hospitalization than those who do not use statins this post has been updated read more ad,1
london reuters scientists in britain have developed a type of hiv test using a usb stick that can give a fast and highly accurate reading of how much virus is in a patient s blood the device created by scientists at imperial college london and the privately held u s firm dna electronics uses a drop of blood to detect hiv then creates an electrical signal that can be read by a computer laptop or handheld device the researchers say the technology although still in the early stages could allow patients to regularly monitor their virus levels in a similar way to diabetes patients checking their blood sugar levels it could be particularly useful in remote settings to help hiv patients manage their treatment more effectively since current tests to detect virus levels take at least three days and involve sending a blood sample to a laboratory monitoring viral load is crucial to the success of hiv treatment at the moment testing often requires costly and complex equipment that can take a couple of days to produce a result said graham cooke who co led the research from the imperial s department of medicine we have taken the job done by this equipment which is the size of a large photocopier and shrunk it down to a usb chip the test which uses a mobile phone chip requires a drop of blood to be placed onto a spot on the usb stick any hiv in the sample triggers an acidity change which the chip transforms into an electrical signal this is sent to the usb stick which shows the result on a computer or electronic device published in the journal scientific reports results showed the stick test was percent accurate over blood samples and the average time to produce a reading was minutes some million people worldwide are infected with the human deficiency virus hiv that causes aids and the majority of them live in sub saharan africa current aids drugs called anti retrovirals reduce virus levels in a patients blood to near zero but in some cases the drugs stop working sometimes because virus has developed resistance to them and the first sign of that would be a rise in a patient s so called viral load virus levels can t be detected by routine hiv tests which can only show whether or not a person has the virus,1

for older people who fracture a hip the prognosis is grim a third or more die within a year and only about in return to their pre injury level of function a new approach to care could mean it doesn t have to be that way more hospitals are putting hip fracture patients on a fast track from the emergency room to the operating room repairing the fracture in as little as six hours after diagnosis the approach appears to produce significantly better outcomes for patients than the conventional practice of waiting up to three days before operating on the fracture it can also reduce the costs of complications and longer hospital stays fast track hospitals also are providing follow up care in special geriatric fracture clinics that steer patients through rehabilitation provide treatment to strengthen bones and help them return to independent living martha aldredge fell and fractured her hip in april while looking for a seat at her granddaughter s high school concert near greenville s c photo amy a chapman an estimated older adults suffer hip fractures in the u s annually and many of them have other medical issues such as high blood pressure or heart disease doctors and surgeons have taken the position that fractures weren t true emergencies and studies suggested delaying surgery allows more time to evaluate patients and stabilize other conditions before giving them medical clearance for an operation but a review of more than million patients led by researchers at nyu langone medical center s department of orthopaedic surgery and published last year in the journal of orthopaedic trauma found that compared with same day surgery each additional day of delay was associated with a significantly higher overall complication rate and surgery two days and three or more days after admission was associated with higher rates of death the deaths are a combination of complications related to the hip fracture and surgery and overall decline in health that seems to be hastened after hip fracture says dr joseph zuckerman study co author and chair of orthopaedic surgery at nyu langone we have to start thinking differently and treat a hip fracture with the same urgency as a heart attack or a stroke says philip j devereaux a cardiologist and researcher at mcmaster university in hamilton ontario canada he says delays can cause the physical trauma of a fracture to spark inflammatory responses in the body that increase stress on the heart and the immune system and increase risk for complications dr devereaux who also heads a surgical research group at mcmaster s population health research institute is leading a large international trial called hip attack which will enroll up to patients in countries the study will compare surgery within hours for a hip fracture against standard care typically surgery hours after diagnosis the aim is to determine the impact of accelerated surgery on death heart attack stroke infection and major bleeding a pilot

missed step for martha aldredge to fall and fracture her hip one evening last april while looking for a seat at her granddaughter s high school concert near greenville s c though bystanders helped her up and she managed to sit through the concert she wasn t able to walk when it was over after being helped into a rolling chair a friend drove her to the emergency room of the bon secours st francis health system s eastside campus in greenville an x ray showed the hip was badly fractured so she was transferred by ambulance to the st francis hospital in downtown greenville where orthopedic surgeon michael o boyle oversees the osteoporotic fracture program dedicated to the care of older patients with hip fractures in the or the next day at p m dr o boyle inserted a long y shaped rod in the femur bone from her hip to her knee ms aldredge stayed on an orthopedic floor for three days before being transferred to a rehabilitation floor for four more days they made me walk right away which turned out to be a great thing ms aldredge says dr o boyle s team told her about the importance of building up muscle and she started outpatient physical therapy a week later going two days a week for three months she was able to stop using a walker and after a break from therapy is continuing for several more sessions to build her stamina she is back to driving herself and says her bones are in good enough shape that she doesn t anticipate future problems dr o boyle says it took a major cultural change to provide such care at st francis in the past he says hip fracture patients were triaged as non urgent cases in the er where they waited on average for eight hours and then might wait nearly three more days for surgery scheduled as a waiting list case patients were given heavy narcotics for pain which contributed to a problem known as postoperative delirium for close to of them leading to longer hospital stays there was little coordination of care among doctors nurses and social workers to ensure good follow up care and patients and families were often anxious due to poor communication we were not doing a good job and the results were abysmal dr o boyle says the fracture clinic has

and it could be the key to making millions of people healthier writing in the journal science translational medicine on wednesday scientists report that a protein produced by hookworms eases the symptoms of asthma in mice and could one day be made into a pill to treat humans the study is the latest from a surprising field of research into the potentially positive sides of parasites one of the most maligned groups in the animal kingdom it began years ago when a gastroenterology surgeon approached parasitologist alex loukas one of the senior authors on the new study the doctor wanted to know whether there might be a connection between the dramatic success of deworming programs around the world and the rise of immune system problems like asthma and celiac disease ad ad if you look at the data that comes in from immunological studies where you remove the parasites that s where you see the highest incidence of autoimmune diseases and allergies said severine navarro the paper s lead author and a senior research fellow in loukas s lab at james cook university in australia many parasites have evolved the ability to hide from their host s immune systems when a hookworm crawls into a human it secretes chemicals that turn off the immune alarm bells and repair the tissue around it it limits its consumption of blood to a few drops a day and doesn t leave its offspring scattered all over its host s gut instead it thoughtfully plants them in the host s poop to ensure an orderly exit from the body like a very conscientious cat burglar the hookworm knows it s best served by not making a mess it s almost symbiotic navarro said because in order for it to survive and thrive it needs its host to be happy and healthy ad ad perhaps the adaptations that help the parasites stay hidden also benefit their host by reining in overactive immune systems thinking that they might be onto something the researchers found adults with celiac disease a serious genetic disorder that causes an autoimmune response to gluten who volunteered to have doctors infect them with a slimy slithery hookworm it was important that the participants be adults because even relatively benign parasites can cause serious problems for children pregnant women and others navarro also warned people with autoimmune disorders that they should not attempt to infect themselves with a hookworm no matter how debilitating their illness might be parasites are no joke for the dozen trial participants the hookworm did improve their tolerance of gluten ad ad it was an intriguing result but it s difficult to scale that kind of study only so many people are willing to have a parasite put inside them for science and because of the risks associated with parasites going around infecting people isn t a viable treatment option so navarro and her colleagues isolated the active ingredient in hookworm spit a compound called aip and injected it into asthmatic mice on a daily basis for five days the animals asthma systems substantially declined and their airways became measurably less inflamed these benefits persisted for weeks after the mice stopped getting the treatment i don t even know how much that is in mouse years navarro said the researchers also noticed that aip seemed to have a calming effect on the body s dendritic cells a part of the immune system responsible for processing threats ad ad it is basically rewiring the cells in that tissue into promoting very efficient regulatory t cells navarro said describing the cells that help modulate the immune system this suggests that aip might also help humans since dendritic cells have the same function in us that they do in mice navarro said their next step is a phase one clinical trial which would test the effectiveness of an aip pill should that work it has the potential to help the million people around the world who suffer from asthma the compound might also be used to treat other autoimmune disorders like celiac disease inflammatory bowel disease and multiple sclerosis ad this study would also suggest that humans lost something when we rid ourselves of the microbes and parasites that had evolved alongside us for tens of thousands of years there s a major school of thought that says that these parasites should be encountered early in life to contribute to the education of the immune system navarro said ad she wouldn t go so far as to call parasites good deworming campaigns and other public health efforts unquestionably have protected countless people from anemia malnutrition developmental disorders and potentially deadly infections but what we need is to find what s good in them she said and try to restore that missing component read more ad,1
a new form of therapy has for the first time been shown to improve the symptoms and behaviour of autistic children offering a potential breakthrough in care for millions of families six years after parents were trained to better understand and interact with their preschool children researchers found that the therapy had moderated the behaviour of those who had been severely autistic unresponsive or unable to speak i ve gone from refrigerator mother to super parent letters read more a child who might have run around a supermarket squealing heedless of their parent putting objects in their mouth and pushing past shoppers to try to press the buttons at checkout might instead wait in the queue and even help load the trolley the research found the success of the preschool autism communication trial pact has surprised even the researchers who designed it there are no drugs to treat the condition which typically sets in around the age of two and many families have tried intensive training of their children by therapists with mixed results pact instead trained the parents to help their children prof jonathan green at the university of manchester who led the study published in the lancet medical journal said they had not found the cure for autism but he and his team believed it had great potential and hoped it would be widely adopted schoolgirls with autism share experiences in young adult novel read more the advantage of this approach over a direct therapist child intervention is that it has potential to affect the everyday life of the child he said our findings are encouraging as they represent an improvement in the core symptoms of autism previously thought very resistant to change this is not a cure in the sense that the children who demonstrated improvements will still show remaining symptoms to a variable extent but it does suggest that working with parents to interact with their children in this way can lead to improvements in symptoms over the long term the trial involved children aged two to four the families visited a clinic twice a week for six months where parents were videoed with their children and a box of toys autistic children might not interact with their parents at all but when eventually a child did offer a toy or made a noise that could be interpreted as a request the incident was rerun on video and the parent encouraged to respond if the child offered a toy the parent reciprocated if the child said a word the parent repeated it and added something the practice was repeated at home every day the therapy continued with the parents for the next six months with less intensity at the end of the first year the researchers could see the children had improved but the most dramatic development was seen at the follow up six years later at the start of the trial of those in the control group who did not get the therapy and of those who did were assessed as severely autistic the children in the intervention group though got better the proportion assessed as severe in the control group was by the end of six years compared with in the intervention group facebook twitter pinterest uta frith emeritus professor of cognitive development at ucl said called the study a remarkably positive story photograph antonio zazueta olmos antonio olmos other experts applauded the work i can see why these researchers are excited said dorothy bishop professor of developmental neuropsychology at the university of oxford these results at follow up are pretty consistent in showing the benefit of this early intervention for autism across a range of measures my impression is that this is an intervention that reduces the severity of autistic symptoms rather than curing autism nevertheless for parents of children with autism even a modest reduction would be worthwhile dr max davie of the royal college of paediatrics and child health said it offered a hugely cheering message for families while uta frith emeritus professor of cognitive development at university college london called it a remarkably positive story because the intervention itself was neither intensive nor invasive the absence of any hope as well as the very sudden regression in children s behaviour led many parents to believe in the discredited theory of andrew wakefield that the mmr measles mumps and rubella vaccine was the cause of autism parents commonly tell us that they fight for a diagnosis but when they finally get it the cupboard is bare with little information or tailored support available to them said dr james cusack director of science at the charity autistica too often parents fall victim to the false claims of charlatans who prey on desperate families these results look promising for the many thousands of parents who want to find early interventions for their children based on solid science the researchers said children s communication with their parents was improved at the end of the six years the parents said there were also improvements in relations with other children in social communication and in repetitive behaviours but there was no change in child anxiety challenging behaviours or depression in the autistic children and they would still need a lot of support while growing up about of children and young people are affected by autistic spectrum disorder which ranges from mild to severe the lifetime costs to the uk which include health social care and education costs as well as productivity losses are estimated at m to m per child and between m and m in the united states,1
your cells might be aging faster than you are and new tests purport to help you find out a few companies are offering mail order testing to measure the length of people s telomeres the protective caps of dna on the ends of chromosomes that have been likened to the plastic tips that prevent shoelaces from fraying telomeres gradually shorten as people age and eventually may disappear leaving cells vulnerable to disease and death telomere diagnostics of menlo park calif launched an test last week users mail in a drop of blood and get back a calculation of their age in teloyears adjusted up or down depending on how they compare with the general population the service also provides advice for improving diet fitness sleep and stress levels which some small studies suggest may help telomeres regain length there s a difference between knowing how old you are and how well you are aging says telomere diagnostics chief executive jason shelton the age you are on the inside on the cellular level may be a better indicator still some top telomere scientists say such information amounts to little more than high tech palm reading in part because telomere length varies so widely in the general population that it isn t clear what length is problematic we don t yet know how to interpret these results it might suggest there is something wrong when there isn t says carol greider director of molecular biology and genetics at johns hopkins medicine who shared the nobel prize for medicine for discovering how telomeres protect chromosomes what your cells can tell you what are telomeres telomeres are stretches of dna at the end of chromosomes that protect them from damage but they gradually wear away each time cells divide when telomeres become critically short chromosomes can fuse together and malfunction causing cells to die which contributes to disease how do telomeres relate to aging many studies have linked diseases of aging with short telomeres but it isn t clear whether short telomeres are a sign of cellular age or help cause the process can this process be slowed telomere shortening is determined by heredity environment and lifestyle choices some studies suggest that controlling inflammation exercising maintaining a healthy diet and weight and not smoking can slow the rate of shortening an enzyme called telomerase adds more length to telomeres but it is mostly found in sperm egg and stem cells and cancerous tumors there is no evidence that telomerase supplements help can measuring my telomeres tell me how long i have to live no most people never reach the end of their telomeres and some scientists say they have to be extremely short before they contribute to disease fellow nobel winner elizabeth blackburn now president of the salk institute co founded the predecessor company to telomere diagnostics but parted ways with it in and is no longer connected to the company dr blackburn declined to comment for this article since telomeres were discovered in the s hundreds of studies have suggested links between telomere length and heart disease diabetes cancer alzheimer s disease and mental health issues a meta analysis of studies involving a total of participants including with cardiovascular diseases found that those in the bottom third of telomere length had a greater risk of cardiovascular disease than those in the top third the review was published in bmj in while telomere length is largely influenced by genetics environment and lifestyle choices can affect it too studies suggest shorter telomeres are associated with lack of exercise poor sleep and a diet high in refined carbohydrates among other factors nasa believes that lengthy space travel can also age people faster and is monitoring how the telomeres of astronauts

nearly a year in space orbiting earth in the space station that was about four times as long as his identical twin mark kelly right nasa is monitoring the brothers telomeres over time to see if extended exposure to radiation and reduced gravity cause people to age faster photo pat sullivan associated press few studies have looked at whether people can lengthen their telomeres by adopting healthy choices an often cited clinical trial published in the lancet in followed men with low risk prostate cancer for five years it found that the men who followed a program of diet activity stress management and social support lengthened their telomeres by about compared with the who didn t the study was conducted by researchers at university of california san francisco and the nonprofit preventive medicine research institute critics say the few controlled trials that show people can lengthen their telomeres are very small and the large observational studies that make up the bulk of the scientific literature on telomeres don t demonstrate cause and effect and while exercise a healthy diet and stress reduction may lower the risk of death and disease it hasn t been shown that telomere length has anything to do with it some researchers say much of what is known about telomeres and disease comes from studying people who have inherited extremely short telomeres and are vulnerable to several specific conditions including pulmonary fibrosis immune deficiency loss of bone marrow and certain cancers it is important for those people who make up at most of the population to know if their telomeres are abnormally short because they should avoid certain treatments says mary armanios clinical director of the telomere center at johns hopkins for everyone else based on what we know in telomere length is not relevant to disease risk dr armanios says they have to be really really short to cause disease and most people never get to that point as they age the testing companies argue that the wealth of observational studies provides ample evidence that short telomeres are a risk factor for many diseases in the general population and that making healthy lifestyle changes can help telomeres regain length knowing your telomere length isn t meant to diagnose a specific disease they say it s more like a check engine light on a car an early indication that something is amiss says calvin harley chief scientific officer at telomere diagnostics which recommends users take the test every six months to track their progress other testing companies also contend that shorter than average telomeres can be a warning sign of future health problems titanovo inc in raleigh n c uses cheek swabs for its test life length based in madrid offers its test only

the genetic legacy each of us inherits is a powerful force and in a few extreme cases it can be deadly still thanks to science genetics need not always be destiny as martha teichner shows us in our cover story amy and brad price s home in omaha nebraska is crazy with all the kids around there are seven of them ages to but if you look closely you ll see small memorials to one more liviana who died in at the age of ½ of a rare nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy mld destroys brain cells and is caused by a single faulty gene she was happy all the time brad said amy added she loved pretty dresses she loved her tutu brad said she was talkative addicted to caillou the animated tv series a lively little girl til she was two her knees were going a little knock kneed amy said and she had been just randomly falling down her doctor said nothing to worry about but she quickly got worse i was in the kitchen doing something and i heard her crying amy recalled and i turned around and said liviana what s wrong and she said mommy my legs don t work liviana was diagnosed in the fall of amy recalled she s sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater and they re telling me she s gonna die many children with the disorder are dead by the age of and it runs in families if it hadn t been for liviana amy and brad price would never have known to have their other children tested they learned that their infant son giovanni had inherited the faulty gene too i get a call from the doctor s office said amy i knew and i was thinking i ve just been told two of my kids now are gonna die except that s not what happened doing research online amy price discovered the existence of a medical trial in milan italy of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for mld that would save giovanni s life and later when his sister cecilia was born with mld hers too the treatment works only on children who like them have not yet started showing symptoms the price family scraped together the money to go to milan the patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on monday and receive their cells back on friday evening said dr alessandra biffi who oversaw the trial a patient s stem cells contain the faulty gene which the doctors have learned how to fix amazing right but then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient s body here s what s really amazing that vehicle is the hiv virus re engineered so the children can t get aids why the hiv virus is it particularly efficient at getting around the body teichner asked yeah it s very efficient in entering our cells and that s why we use it dr biffi replied how well did the children do it will take years to know for sure but so far so good at least of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment dr biffi said some of the children were going to school and having a normal life giovanni price is six now in first grade he and his sister cecilia ceci for short have to go back to milan twice a year to be tested and monitored brad price calls dr biffi our angel she took us in like family so why italy and not the united states gene therapy has a checkered history in the s hyped as the next big thing research withered here after serious setbacks including a death during clinical trials but more than years later it s back one sign dr biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at dana farber boston children s cancer and blood disorders center teichner asked do you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own i think yes absolutely dr biffi replied the mld trial she thinks demonstrates what s possible offering promise to the million americans who suffer from some rare diseases trials for the experimental treatment ceci and giovanni price received in milan have not begun in the u s they are two of only children in the world with mld to receive it compare giovanni to calliope joy carr also six from bala cynwyd pa outside philadelphia she can turn her head a little she can still smile and laugh but that s about all she was diagnosed at for her parents college professors patrick carr and maria kefalis coming to terms with the disease was wrenching it s decline in slow motion and that s difficult said carr i remember the social worker said it s good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children kefalis said after more than a year of rage and grief kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping mld children it was too late for cal but she was desperate to give her daughter s life meaning we re not wealthy people she said we didn t know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars and so we said well we ll start selling cupcakes the calliope joy foundation was formed in it s been slow going but the money added up and when kefalis learned about the italian trial and the fact that amy price had to keep going back to milan with giovanni and ceci it was clear she would use the money to help families get to italy she sent me a picture of giovanni playing in his front yard kefalis said he s three months younger than cal so he should ve been as sick as cal he should have been on a feeding tube he should be paralyzed and i thought i gotta be a part of this i need to help this happen again and again and again maria kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war her war against mld she s raised more than and helped where she could but she s hit a wall so far not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the fda the trial in italy is closed to new patients it could be years before any children with mld will be allowed to receive the treatment in the united states now it s just impatience kefalis said now it s like when do we get this here what will it take tell me what you need me to do until then she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time the price children giovanni and cecilia proof to her the war can be won teichner asked brad and amy price you keep using the word miracle in what way is all of this a miracle our son s still with us and cecilia as well they replied that s the miracle for more info,1
even if you re not a big fan of seafood you probably know that adding more fish to your diet can do a lot of good from improving your heart health to lowering inflammation now according to scientists at the university of colorado there is even evidence that the healthy fat can boost your chances of getting pregnant the study presented at the american society of reproductive medicine annual meeting was in mice so more research needs to be completed before omega foods or supplements become part of treatment for infertility but dr malgorzata skaznik wikiel an obstetrician gynecologist who led the study is encouraged she worked with a group of mice that are genetically bred to have healthy ratios of omega fatty acids these mice are born with the ability to bathe cells and tissues in omega fats so the team then looked at their egg development in the ovaries what she found the mice with the higher levels of omega fatty acids seemed to have more precursors to egg cells than control mice with lower levels of the fat meaning they had a larger reserve of eggs to be these could then mature into a healthy egg that is fertilized and can lead to a live birth when the ovaries were examined even further skaznik wikiel also found that the quality of the eggs were better among the animals with higher levels of omega s higher quality eggs improves the chances that the egg will be fertilized and develop into a live pup based on this study it looks very encouraging that omega s can potentially improve fertility says skaznik wikiel our study shows that there may be some relationship between dietary factors and things like egg quality so one idea may be recommending supplementation with omega s to improve fertility exactly how the healthy omega fatty acids are helping the ovary to produce better quality eggs isn t clear yet but other studies skaznik wikiel has done with mice suggests that these fats may lower levels of inflammation that can adversely affect ovarian function more studies need to replicate and confirm the role that omega fatty acids might play in fertility but for now skaznik wikiel says that there isn t much harm in consuming more omega fats some people who are predisposed to bleeding problems may be at higher risk of hemorrhages with high doses of omega s but those cases are relatively rare there may also be other benefits linked to omega fatty acids for the fetus as well in helping nerve development that s why many prenatal vitamins include forms of omega fats we hope in the future to have more answers to be able to say firmly that yes omega fatty acids are the way to go for women hoping to get pregnant she says but even without that firm answer at this point i don t see the harm in supplementing contact us at,1

by steven reinberg healthday reporter friday oct healthday news a multiple sclerosis drug usually reserved for people in the late stages of the disease seems to offer long term remission in newly diagnosed patients researchers report because of serious side effects the drug lemtrada alemtuzumab is approved in the united states only for patients who have failed other treatments but the authors of a new study believe giving it early may slow and even reverse some disease related disability the expectation in ms has always been to try to slow down the progression of the disease now we can tell our patients that a significant number can actually improve by reversing their disability said lead researcher dr gavin giovannoni he is a neurology professor at queen mary university of london in england the treatment is not without its downsides however because of the potential for side effects people who received this treatment have to undergo monthly blood and urine tests for four years after the last dose giovannoni said giovannoni described lemtrada as an immune system rebooter first it depletes the immune system then it allows it to recover he explained during the time when the immune system is depleted there is a risk of infection over eight to weeks including herpes infections he said also when the immune system rebuilds itself a significant number of people about percent will develop another autoimmune disease giovannoni said these include graves disease a thyroid disorder and a bleeding bruising disorder called idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura itp which occurs in about percent of patients he noted but these diseases can be treated so it s not like ms it s kind of trading in your ms for another autoimmune disease giovannoni said still one ms specialist who reviewed the new study said patients need to be cautious about taking the drug lemtrada is not for every patient with ms and the decision to use it should be carefully considered said dr dhanashri miskin an attending neurologist at lenox hill hospital in new york city although the safety profile is generally manageable for the right patient risks probably outweigh benefits in patients with mild or early stage disease miskin said the decision to start lemtrada should be made in the context of the risks including infusion associated reactions infections and autoimmune adverse events she said although alemtuzumab lemtrada treatment is associated with safety risks those risks are manageable in most patients miskin said the new trial of more than patients with relapsing remitting ms was funded by sanofi genzyme and bayer healthcare pharmaceuticals the drug s makers ms occurs when the immune system mistakenly attacks the protective sheath around nerve fibers in the brain and spinal cord people can suffer muscle weakness numbness vision problems and difficulty with balance and coordination relapsing remitting ms is the most common type with symptoms suddenly worsening and then going into remission for this study giovannoni and colleagues treated patients with relapsing remitting ms who had not responded to at least one other ms drug lemtrada was given to patients while received another drug interferon beta a the researchers assessed disability levels at the start of the study and every three months for two years by the study s end nearly percent of those given lemtrada had improved by at least one point on a point disability test versus about percent of those receiving interferon the researchers found moreover patients receiving lemtrada were times more likely to have their thinking skills improve compared to those given interferon and they were more than twice as likely to see improvement in their ability to move without tremor or clumsiness the findings showed the findings held after researchers adjusted the results to make sure the gains weren t led by those recovering from relapses giovannoni believes the drug could offer real relief from ms symptoms not only does alemtuzumab improve disability but most patients go into long term remission of at least five to eight years he said some patients have been going years without any evidence of disease activity he said according to bruce bebo executive vice president for research at the national multiple sclerosis society restoring lost function is a significant unmet need for people living with ms this study examines previous findings related to the reversal of some disability in those receiving alemtuzumab he said i am encouraged by these results and urge others to pursue potentially restorative approaches to treatment bebo said giovannoni pointed out that most of the drug s benefits are obtained early in the disease if you really want this drug to have a big impact you should use it as early as possible in the european union it s recommended for early use he noted the report was published online oct in the journal neurology more information for more about

the race to create the next potent ovarian cancer drug is coming to a head ovarian cancer has historically been one of the harder cancers to treat but a promising new class of drugs called parp inhibitors is proving powerful in delaying the growth of tumors by preventing cancer cells from repairing themselves after they ve been damaged by chemotherapy in recent days the researchers behind three parp drug contenders threw down preliminary data during the european society for medical oncology conference in denmark advertisement massachusetts based tesaro was the clear front runner with its experimental once a day ovarian cancer pill niraparib its results built upon exciting data it released in june showing that its drug can increase the window of time in which a woman s cancer doesn t get worse the study did not assess whether the drug helped women live longer just how long it stopped tumors from growing a small pilot study on a drug called talazoparib which is now owned by pfizer pfe recently showed similarly compelling results but colorado s clovis oncology clvs fared less well though its own parp inhibitor rucaparib showed that it could help some women compared to chemotherapy alone its data didn t measure up to the other two trials the company s stock plunged percent on friday after the data were released one parp inhibitor has already been approved by the food and drug administration olaparib sold by astrazeneca azn as lynparza it s being used to treat ovarian cancer in women who have already undergone chemotherapy chemotherapy deals heavy damage to tumors but often the cancer cells are able to regroup and repair themselves parp inhibitors work by stopping this repair they re particularly useful in treating cancers associated with the brca mutation since this gene codes for proteins that help repair damaged dna while chemotherapy is still used as a first line of attack parp inhibitors are largely being studied as maintenance drugs the hope is that they ll keep cancer at bay once it s been attacked by chemo a number of cancers are associated with brca mutations including breast prostate and pancreatic more and more clinical trials will spring up to test parp inhibitors in combination with other cancer treatments such as immunotherapy said dr christina annunziata an investigator at the national cancer institute who studied the efficacy of lynparza in ovarian cancer patients the field is so hot that over the summer pfizer agreed to spend an eye popping billion to buy san francisco based biotech medivation the key asset pfizer wanted the parp inhibitor talazoparib so far there s just extremely early data but it looks promising in a pilot study of breast cancer patients on the drug at md anderson cancer center in houston tumors shrank on average percent we found a significant decrease in the tumors with only two months of therapy said dr jennifer litton the lead investigator she s launching a larger trial for further study as for tesaro it first shared initial data from a phase clinical trial this past june it showed that patients with recurrent ovarian cancer treated with the drug got an extra months without their disease getting worse compared to a control group at the european conference this weekend tesaro added a few more details to that data the study looked at patients whose cancer responds to a certain type of chemotherapy known as platinum chemo the best results came from patients with the brca mutation their tumors didn t start to grow again for months on average compared to months for a control group that just received a placebo other groups of patients treated with the drug also had significantly better outcomes than control groups the results were published this weekend in the new england journal of medicine a few weeks ago the food and drug administration granted tesaro s drug fast track approval status and this new data will support its registration applications to both the fda and the european medicines agency tesaro ceo lonnie moulder said the company is now planning trials in lung cancer and is considering other cancers to pursue in the field these would be described as landmark results moulder said at this time there s nothing available that has been approved by regulatory agencies for these women who have recurrence to their ovarian cancer by comparison clovis oncology has floundered the company aims to use its parp inhibitor rucaparib to treat only patients with brca mutations who have had two or more chemotherapies but the data it presented at the european conference showed that the drug may not actually be more effective than lynparza the parp inhibitor that s been marketed by astrazeneca since the study s lead investigator rebecca kristeleit defended the performance of rucaparib adding that one can t compare clovis s drug to tesaro s it s a completely different population and a different use of the drugs she said

copenhagen reuters merck co scored a double hit on sunday with new clinical data showing its keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients either when given on its own or with chemotherapy as a monotherapy keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker and when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non selected patients it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone another similar drug from roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so called second line option in patients who had received prior treatment remember this day it s a new day for lung cancer treatment stefan zimmermann of lausanne s university hospital told reporters at the european society for medical oncology esmo congress as the results were presented an editorial in the new england journal of medicine where the merck monotherapy results were published said keytruda could become a new standard of care the various findings suggest that treating lung cancer the biggest cancer killer globally with powerful new immune system boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected rival drugmaker bristol myers squibb had tried a catch all approach with its opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called pd l keytruda as a sole agent was targeted only at patients with high pd l making them more receptive to immunotherapy lead researcher martin reck of germany s lung clinic grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the pd l biomarker would now become standard from today u s regulators are expected to decide whether to approve keytruda for first line non small cell lung cancer the most common type by dec merck had already said in june that keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at esmo combination therapy the second trial mixing keytruda with chemotherapy was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized phase ii study many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors expectations up until now have been quite low in the event researchers reported that merck s combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by percent compared to chemotherapy alone after months while percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus percent patients in this trial were not selected by pd l expression but the study did find that those with higher pd l had a higher response roger perlmutter merck s head of research said both trials suggested keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum based chemotherapy which is now more than two decades old drugs like keytruda and opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body s natural killer cells to home in on tumors they are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead with lung cancer the largest market up until now bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets with forecasts for opdivo declining while those for keytruda have risen the current consensus forecast among analysts is for keytruda sales to reach billion in with opdivo selling billion according to thomson reuters data results of bristol s failed opdivo trial which included patients with tumors testing only percent or higher for pd l against the percent cut off used by merck were also presented at esmo these showed progression free survival was months with opdivo and months with chemotherapy although the difference was not statistically significant overall survival was months with opdivo versus months the failure of opdivo to work for all comers in lung cancer was first announced in august without any details it was a major setback for bristol wiping out around a quarter of the company s market value and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead with bristol and astrazeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together while roche and merck look at adding chemotherapy,1

the disease is characterized by an itching oozing rash that can cover almost all of the skin the constant itch to say nothing of the disfigurement can be so unbearable that many patients consider suicide there has never been a safe and effective treatment on saturday the results of two large clinical trials of a new drug offered hope to the estimated million adult americans with an uncontrolled moderate to severe form of the disease atopic dermatitis which is a type of eczema most patients who got the active drug dupilumab instead of a placebo reported that the itching began to wane within two weeks and was gone in a few months as their skin began to clear nearly percent of participants getting the drug saw all or almost all of their rash disappear for some relief was almost instantaneous i knew immediately i was on the drug and not the placebo said daniela velasco an event planner in playa del carmen mexico within a couple of weeks the ugly red rash that had covered percent of her body was almost gone even better she said for the first time i didn t feel any itch at all,1

the window for helping certain stroke patients with a potentially life saving blood clot removal surgical treatment may be longer than previously thought according to a study published today in the journal of the american medical association traditionally stroke is treated with medications that stabilize or diminish blood clots in the brain in select patients surgical intervention to remove the clot may be possible to mitigate effects of the stroke currently the american stroke association advises that blood clot removal for some patients an emergency procedure called endovascular thrombectomy recently developed and increasingly used in addition to medical therapies should be done within six hours after stroke symptoms to lower the amount of disability patients will face later but this analysis showed that the time for treatment could be slightly longer up to hours this study could affect the current guidelines on treating stroke patients according to dr cathy sila director of the comprehensive stroke center at university hospitals cleveland medical center she said there is compelling rationale to move that window a little bit as a result of having lost blood flow to the brain for an extended time stroke victims often suffer physical disabilities and lose varying degrees of their independence they often require longer term care and therapies long term disability of stroke is more expensive than cost of hospitalization sila told abc news today authors from multiple institutions including the university of calgary pooled data from five studies on stroke treatments to see if providing endovascular thrombectomy in addition to standard medical treatment past six hours would help patients they analyzed those studies for patients who have had large blood vessel strokes seeking to understand how much of an effect blood clot removal surgery performed after six hours would have on their longer term recovery they used a benchmark of three months after the stroke to assess patients level of disability in total patients were enrolled in the five trials studied the researchers examined clinical data and brain imaging in addition to the patients physical function they found that the patients who received standard medical therapy along with an endovascular thrombectomy up to hours after developing stroke symptoms were less likely than patients who were treated with only medications to report disability three months later when they examined the patients three months after the stroke each hour delay in receiving the treatment corresponded in worse outcomes for the patients including more severe disability and less functional independence this meant that even the patients who received the treatment outside of the generally accepted hours cut off up to the hours point tended to report less disability during their recovery however if people received the treatment after hours from onset of symptoms there was no statistical improvement dr mayank goyal a co author of the study and professor of radiology university of calgary said he hopes the study will help raise awareness about the importance of getting prompt treatment for a stroke and having an efficient system to provide this procedure time is brain goyal told abc news the faster we can re establish blood flow to brain the higher the likelihood of the patients having a good outcome and going back to independent living sila said further study is needed to find out if these kinds of procedures could benefit people even after the hours from symptom onset she pointed out that these studies are important since they can help change guidelines and push insurance companies to cover the procedure for more patients we need to have this kind of data so third party payers would have it to base costs on she said dr lei lynn is an internal medicine resident at george washington university hospital and a resident in the abc news medical unit,1
artist lorie novak in front of work from her migraine register project which documents all the time she s lost to debilitating migraines it often starts with the aura zig zagging lines come into view everyday light becomes searingly bright and vision starts to slip these are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way it s like you re possessed said lorie novak who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood i almost feel separate from my body like it s just this painful shell around me that s not me advertisement novak now in her s is one of the roughly million americans who suffer from migraines there are few effective treatments and no new drugs have been developed since the early s but that could soon change a handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines chasing a blockbuster market that wall street analysts say could reach billion a year in worldwide sales the new drugs target a bodily protein called cgrp which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain scientists haven t nailed down just how the protein affects migraines but they re sure about two things cgrp levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away and thus four drug makers amgen amgn eli lilly teva pharmaceuticals and alder biopharmaceuticals have fashioned antibodies that can bind to cgrp molecules and block their activity the goal to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping cgrp in its tracks so far it seems to be working in mid stage clinical trials each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants cutting the number of days they re afflicted by migraines roughly in half it s by no means a cure for migraines but it should be enough to merit food and drug administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials according to eric schmidt a securities analyst at cowen and co each treatment is now in late stage development targeting the roughly percent of migraine sufferers who like novak have at least four headache days per month the first therapy could hit the market in and if everything works out all four could available by the end of the decade so far the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share there will certainly be hypercompetition said william ratner lilly s senior director of global headache marketing but the companies fortunes are intertwined he said and the class only wins if headache care in america improves aiming to prevent migraines before they start there s plenty of room for improvement existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy that medication topamax has been dubbed dubbed sleepomax by doctors and patients because it s also a heavy sedative i m very enthusiastic as i think everyone in the field is about having another treatment option for people with migraines said dr elizabeth loder a professor of neurology at harvard medical school and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at brigham and women s hospital targeting cgrp is not a particularly new idea researchers picked up on the protein s scent more than years ago and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity merck got all the way into late stage trials with an anti cgrp tablet spending more than billion only to find in that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future with the exquisite sensitivity of an antibody however scientists believe they can block cgrp without triggering dangerous side effects alder ceo randy schatzman said because antibodies stay active in the body for weeks the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay merck s failed pill by contrast was meant as an on the spot treatment after the pain started so in some senses it s a paradigm shift schatzman said but there are still hurdles to clear only about half of patients seem to respond to cgrp antibodies and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time a genetic test would be the holy grail of personalized medicine said rob lenz amgen s global development lead for neuroscience but no one has made one yet and long term safety remains a major question mark to date none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials but they ve only reported data from week studies on about total patients it will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time loder said i felt like my life was being stolen from me any advance even an incremental one would be a major leap for the field said emily bates who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the university of colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment bates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college like many patients she didn t respond to any of the preventative therapies available the pain is more than anything i ve ever experienced and i ve run on broken legs before she said i felt like my life was being stolen from me collectively americans miss about million workdays each year because of migraine that lost productivity costs society about billion each year according to the migraine research foundation yet scientific progress has been slow in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding bates said it s a subjective symptom that predominantly affects women said loder the harvard neurologist that s a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it novak a professor of photography at new york university s tisch school of the arts spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition but she decided to change all that in with a project called migraine register she takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine some years that s more than pictures the idea in part was to humanize chronic migraines but the project also forced novak to reckon with the toll of the disease something she had tried to ignore for years that for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life novak said of how much time i lose,1
cancer cells remain elusive and tough to locate but a new crop of nuclear imaging tests promises to lead to more accurate prognosis and treatment the tests use imaging agents that combine radioactive isotopes with targeted molecules that can spot cancer at the cellular level the ability to accurately locate the cancers helps physicians make better and earlier diagnoses and may eventually make possible targeted nuclear medicine therapies that identify and kill cancer cells but not the surrounding healthy cells this summer the food and drug administration approved two such tests one can trace slow growing prostate cancer cells while the other targets a rare condition where neuroendocrine cells develop into tumors advanced accelerator applications a french pharmaceutical company that developed the test for neuroendocrine tumors also is seeking approval for a drug called lutathera that uses the same technique to zero in on the cancer that needs treating says chief executive stefano buono finding the fuel developed in the s nuclear imaging is used to reveal the body s metabolic activities in contrast with static imaging such as x rays which provide just a snapshot positron emission tomography or pet scans can be used to identify many common cancers as well as alzheimer s and epilepsy but many pet scans aren t effective at locating certain cancers including cancer of the prostate the third most common type of cancer in the u s with more than new cases and more than deaths expected this year that s because the most common imaging agent known as fdg uses glucose to locate cancer cells prostate and several other cancers don t use as much glucose so the scans aren t effective for those diseases the new tests pair radioactive materials with a receptor that reacts to a hormone for neuroendocrine tumors or in the case of prostate cancer amino acid which is what fuels the disease the result is a better view of the cancer spotting a relapse blue earth diagnostics ltd based in oxford england developed the prostate imaging agent called axumin based on a molecule originally developed by mark goodman a professor of radiology and imaging sciences at emory university s school of medicine in the mid s the agent was administered commercially for the first time in september at a hospital in atlanta with recurrent prostate cancer the test s ability to locate cancer at the cellular level means that it can complement current diagnostic tests prostate specific antigen or psa is the common way to screen for the disease but it isn t entirely reliable because the psa protein count also rises with age and disease of the prostate like inflammation and it doesn t help to determine the location of the tumor that can be crucial in deciding on treatment if the cancer is confined to the pelvis surgery or radiation can be used to treat the disease but if it has spread to lymph nodes or the bones hormone therapy may be required the test also allows for earlier detection of recurrent disease an estimated to of men who are treated for prostate cancer will relapse after five years according to the prostate cancer foundation the new scan can detect cancer with a relatively low psa count say under when the cancer may still be curable says mark scholz founder and executive director of the non profit prostate cancer research institute that changes everything there are other efforts seeking to screen for cancer on a cellular level genetic testing for example looks for inherited mutations in a person s genes to gauge the risk of developing hereditary cancer and allow patients to be on guard even before any symptoms appear still nuclear imaging can provide complementary information to these newer methods for one nuclear imaging can see how the tumor behaves in the body and its immediate environment and can be used to inform physicians about changes in the disease during the course of treatment says dr janet eary a deputy associate director at the national cancer institute s cancer imaging program ms or is a reporter for the wall street journal in new york she can be reached at,1
when babies eat certain foods early in life the kinds so many end up allergic to like eggs and peanuts they re less likely to develop allergies to those foods later on finds a new analysis published in the journal of the american medical association jama this is relatively new thinking not so long ago in the american academy of pediatrics recommended that allergenic foods be kept away from infants until they were at least a year old and often older that warning was especially strong for those with a family history of allergies but as an editorial published in the same issue of jama points out in the next decade food allergy prevalence nearly doubled in the united states that advice has been amended and newer evidence has shown that introducing foods earlier is actually better for preventing food allergies the authors of the just published study reviewed all of the available evidence on the topic and included studies in their final analysis health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now they found evidence of moderate certainty that introducing peanuts early between ages and months is linked to a reduction in the risk of developing a peanut allergy eggs too showed this association when they were introduced between ages and months early introduction of another common allergen fish was also linked to less allergy possibly due to the anti inflammatory effects of omega s though evidence for this link wasn t as certain early introduction didn t seem to make a difference for autoimmune diseases at least according to the available evidence eating gluten young wasn t associated with the risk of developing celiac disease exactly why is a question researchers are still exploring it is not clear that it is the specific early introduction of an allergenic food that renders immunological protection rather than the accompanying increased diversity in the diet that occurs as a by product writes dr matthew greenhawt an allergy and immunology specialist at children s hospital colorado in the accompanying editorial more research is necessary to figure out the ideal amounts of these allergens the optimum times of introduction and the reasons behind the link write to mandy oaklander at,1
london reuters exposure to bright light can raise testosterone levels and lead to greater sexual satisfaction in men with low sexual desire according to the results of a small scientific trial scientists at the university of siena in italy found that regular early morning use of a light box similar to those used to combat seasonal affective disorder or sad helped men increase testosterone and improved their sex lives andrea fagiolini a professor who led the study and presented it at the european college of neuropsychopharmacology conference in vienna on monday said the treatment may prove useful during the northern hemisphere s darker winter months the increased levels of testosterone explain the greater reported sexual satisfaction he said in the northern hemisphere the body s testosterone production naturally declines from november through april and then rises steadily through the spring and summer with a peak in october low sexual desire can affect significant numbers of men after the age of with studies finding that up to percent of men report problems fagiolini s team recruited men diagnosed with either hypoactive sexual desire disorder or sexual arousal disorder both characterized by a lack of interest in sex after taking baseline readings they divided the men into two groups and gave one regular treatment with a bright light box while the control or placebo group was treated with a light box adapted to give out significantly less light we found fairly significant differences fagiolini said before treatment both groups averaged a sexual satisfaction score of around out of but after treatment the group exposed to the bright light was scoring sexual satisfaction scores of around in contrast the control group only showed an average score of around after treatment,1
an inhaler that protects the lungs against air pollution has been developed by scientists and could help the many millions of people affected by toxic air to avoid its worst effects the inhaler delivers a molecule first found in bacteria in the egyptian desert which stabilises water on the surface of the lung cells to form a protective layer it is expected to be available as an inexpensive over the counter product outdoor air pollution is a global health crisis that kills over million people a year and it has long been linked to lung and heart disease and strokes but research is also uncovering new impacts on health including degenerative brain diseases such as alzheimer s mental illness and this week diabetes the impact of air pollution costs tn a year according to a world bank report published last week in the uk at least people a year die prematurely from air pollution with a cross party committee of mps calling it a public health emergency but the government s plans to tackle the issue were heavily criticised this week just as alerts were issued for extreme air pollution across much of northern england a day later it was announced that more ambitious plans for london from mayor sadiq khan were overwhelmingly backed by the public vehicles are a key contributor to air pollution but a year after the vw emissions scandal broke most new diesel cars still emit far more toxic nitrogen oxides on the road than the official lab based limit action to clean up air is urgently needed across the world but cutting emissions for vehicles and other sources will take years meaning ways to reduce the harm in the meantime could be vital the new inhaler has been developed by german medical devices company bitop and is based on a molecule called ectoine discovered in the s in a desert bacterium which uses the compound to conserve water in c heat it is quite an inert molecule that does one main thing which is bind water which stabilises cell membrane tissues against physical or chemical damage said dr andreas bilstein at bitop it supports the natural barrier when inhaled this helps prevent the damage caused by air pollution particles that can lead to asthma chronic obstructive pulmonary disease copd and lung cancer bilstein said damage cannot occur as strongly and there is less inflammatory response and so disease progression is reduced the perfect situation is that the patient inhales in the morning and evening at home the inhaler has been tested in three small groups of patients particularly at risk from air pollution due to asthma copd and bronchitis with the positive results due to be published soon bilstein said ectoine does not interact with cell receptors so it is classed as a medical device rather than a drug this means large clinical trials are not required for official approval and the inhaler could be on sale soon at an estimated cost of a month after bitop selects a marketing partner a version of the product for use in nebulisers will be available this year in germany and poland while an ectoine based nasal spray for allergy relief is already available bilstein said the inhaler could be useful around the world as particulate air pollution is not just a european problem especially in asia china in particular the demand for such a product is even higher i was in new york last week and the air was also not very clean the protective effect of ectoine was discovered by prof jean krutmann and colleagues at the leibniz research institute for environmental medicine while investigating whether the molecule could protect skin against sun damage bitop funded a series of studies now published in prominent scientific journals the point that it can prevent the lung inflammation induced by ultrafine particles is established there is no more doubt krutmann said antioxidants can also provide some protection but there has been controversy over the effectiveness of such food supplements he said personally i think it is much better to eat lots of vegetables and fruit rather than taking any supplements dr richard russell a consultant respiratory physician in the nhs and medical advisor to the british lung foundation who was not involved in the research said the inhaler was both credible and promising ectoine is a beautifully elegant molecule and it clearly works by helping water to stabilise giving you a film of water in times of stress the work that has been published thus far in credible internationally recognised journals show that this stuff has positive properties protecting against triggered inflammation he told the guardian russell who also lectures at imperial college and oxford university said it might also be useful for the treatment of asthma copd and other lung diseases not only prevention it could potentially do so much more it is actually quite exciting and there is clearly a lot more to come from this story krutmann said slashing air pollution remained paramount it is very nice to be able to protect people against the detrimental effects but this should not be used as an argument that we can now stop working on reducing particulate air pollution the best thing is that we have clean air because then we don t need any prophylactic treatment but on the other hand we have to be realistic and in many countries you cannot just switch traffic overnight to electric cars and do other drastic things it will take many more years especially in countries like china and i think there is an ethical need to provide something to the general population to protect them he said,1
from the jewish schvitz to mesoamerican houses of heat people all over the world have long associated a good sweat with a wide assortment of health benefits and some of the latest research seems to support those ideas one long term study of middle aged finnish men found those who spent time in a sauna days a week enjoyed a drop in their risk for a fatal heart disease or episode the heart health benefits were even greater for men who sweated it out in a sauna more frequently sauna bathing leads to a significant increase in heart rate and reduction in total vascular resistance thereby decreasing blood pressure says dr ernst van der wall chief of cardiology at the netherlands leiden university medical centre in a recent editorial appearing in the netherlands heart journal van der wall lays out the research in support of sauna bathing as a safe and salubrious habit for healthy people of all ages he also says expert concerns about the safety of sauna bathing for those with heart conditions may be overblown death in the sauna is a rare event even in finland where the frequency of sauna bathing is high he writes health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now still the big questions surrounding sauna bathing s safety have always centered on its occupant s and her heart s ability to withstand the heat traditional saunas use either wood or electricity to warm the air in a chamber to a temperature of degrees which many people find unendurable for more than a few minutes infrared saunas by contrast do not heat the air around you using electromagnetic radiation infrared lamps warm your body directly that may sound freaky or even unsafe but neonatal beds for newborns have long utilized infrared heating elements to ensure babies are kept warm without being stifled as infrared heat penetrates more deeply than warmed air users develop a more vigorous sweat at a lower temperature than they would in traditional saunas says dr richard beever a clinical assistant professor of family medicine at the university of british columbia while there s not a ton of published research looking specifically at infrared saunas beever has published a review of all the existing studies he could turn up on the subject he says there s evidence to support the use of infrared saunas for high blood pressure congestive heart failure and chronic pain people who spent minutes a day for two weeks in an infrared sauna enjoyed a significant drop in blood pressure compared to a control group who spend the same amount of time in a room temperature space one japanese study reported more research found time spent in an infrared sauna could help even out irregular heartbeats improve scores on physical fitness tests and boost endothelial function in the heart s vessels beever s review also looked at some of the other purported health benefits of infrared saunas including pain management among chronic pain sufferers those who spent time each day in a sauna for four weeks enjoyed a improvement in sleep quality and were more likely to return to work compared to a no sauna group beever makes it clear all of these reports were based on small groups and require further study also he found no strong evidence of lost weight improved cholesterol scores or some of the other benefits frequently

jessie quinn here with daughter luna williams has been cancer free for five years thanks to a transplant of stem cells from a baby s umbilical cord courtesy of jessie quinn jessie quinn of sacramento was years old when loss of appetite weight loss some eye issues and finally pelvic pain sent her to the emergency room in tests quickly revealed she had acute myeloid leukemia a type of blood cancer that progresses quickly and doctors told her that chemotherapy would probably not be enough she would need a bone marrow transplant quinn who has a science background knew that finding a donor would be difficult in college she had donated to a bone marrow registry after learning that people like her with a mixed racial heritage have a much harder time than others finding a match in fact when she and her doctors scoured the registry for a match for her only one name came up her own i didn t know whether to laugh or cry quinn said while searching unsuccessfully for a match for five months quinn underwent four cycles of chemotherapy to keep the leukemia at bay what eventually saved her though was an experimental transplant using stem cells from the blood of a baby s umbilical cord an approach that can be used without perfectly matching blood types colleen delaney of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle helped create the cord blood technique courtesy of colleen delaney this therapy and another haploidentical transplantation which uses bone marrow cells that are only half matched to a patient have revolutionized the treatment of blood cancers in the past few years every biological child is a half match for a parent and vice versa many patients who previously died for lack of a match are now cured of their underlying malignancy said richard jones director of the bone marrow transplant program at johns hopkins kimmel cancer center a dangerous process bone marrow transplants which infuse healthy blood cells taken from a donor are used when chemotherapy and radiation fail to stop cancerous blood cells from taking over and ultimately destroying a person s immune system the transplant can be taken from either the blood or bone marrow which produces blood cells the procedure is typically preceded by high doses of chemotherapy and radiation that wipe out the patient s faulty blood cells and replace them with healthy ones from a donor the process is dangerous because it leaves a patient vulnerable to life threatening infection for months before the reconstituted immune system begins to work in the past a patient s body would reject as a foreign intruder anything but a perfect or near perfect match a usually fatal development umbilical cord stem cells however are sort of a blank slate because they haven t been exposed to much life such as bacteria and viruses and thus are more easily accepted even if they aren t a perfect match when quinn s doctors found no match on the donor registry she turned to a clinical trial examining the safety of taking blood cells from umbilical cords expanding their numbers in a laboratory and then infusing them into patients of full screen autoplay close skip ad the case files medical mysteries view photos from a

running out of time read the case cam cottrill for the washington post buy photo wait second to continue because each umbilical cord produces only a tiny number of stem cells umbilical cord transplants take longer to work than standard transplants which makes patients more likely to get fatal infections and if cells from several umbilical cords are used the chances of immunity problems increase this expanded cord blood technique has been a huge home run for patients said colleen delaney of the fred hutchinson cancer research center in seattle who helped create it no one had successfully taken stem cells and gotten them to grow and put back in a person she said the advance should be particularly valuable for minorities and people of mixed race background whose chances of finding a matched donor were slim to none this is where cord blood becomes an amazing and beautiful resource delaney said we can find cord blood donors for percent of patients who cannot find a donor quinn was hospitalized for days and she said the recovery was difficult but relatively uneventful mostly she had to deal with overwhelming fatigue for the first year she also developed graft versus host disease which caused rashes when her skin was exposed to the sun but she has been free of cancer for five years she remembers learning that she had leukemia and assuming that she would soon die it still gives me pause i went to costa rica that i am able to travel and went backpacking and kayaking quinn says i was so sure i would never get to do those things again it s an indescribable feeling in haploidential transplants rather than wiping out the patient s immune system doctors use just enough drugs to suppress it this reduces the risk of damaging organs or causing a rejection of the donated marrow everybody now has a donor parents are always haploidentical children are always haploidentical jones said siblings are half the time and all second degree relatives grandchildren nieces nephews have a percent chance of being a half match everybody now has a donor and that is a major advance yet doctors and patients may not be aware there are choices other than conventional bone marrow transplants jones said despite the recent data showing equivalency of half matched and cord blood transplants with conventional matched transplants many cancer doctors and even some transplant doctors still consider these newer transplants not standard practice jones said there are still lots of patients in need of transplants that are not getting them because of lack of matched donors and that is unacceptable in the year jones estimates that about transplants of donated stem cells were done in primarily for leukemia and lymphoma but also for nonmalignant blood disorders such as sickle cell and aplastic anemia but that more than could easily be done annually if more doctors embraced the new methods now available gregg gordon developed leukemia in he noticed two bumps under his shin and had been feeling unusually tired he went to his internist who drew blood and within hours gordon was in the hospital receiving chemotherapy his wife caryn recalls how little they knew about his disease acute myeloid leukemia as doctors discussed treatment with them we knew it would be a very long journey to battle this disease caryn gordon said he decided he would be focused on being the patient and said do whatever you have to do with me because i want to walk my girls who were then and down the aisle on advice of their hematologist the gordons traveled to hutchinson which has established a national reputation as a bone marrow transplant center but quickly discovered there was no good donor match we thought we would find a match it was extraordinarily shocking to us that it was impossible caryn recalled according to be the match which operates the national donor program a patient s likelihood of finding a donor match on their registry ranges from to percent depending on ethnic background but gregg gordon was able to participate in delaney s clinical trial and like quinn received lab expanded cord blood following intensive chemotherapy and radiation he also will be five years cancer free in september not everyone is as lucky quinn gordon and other participants in delaney s clinical trial are all alive in remission at a median age of about years the researcher said but two patients died when the disease relapsed a larger trial using umbilical cord blood that had been expanded in a lab is underway read more he beat leukemia so why was he feeling so bad new therapies offer hope for a really bad brain cancer scientists just doubled the number of known contagious cancers,1
whether you call it water running aqua jogging or hydrotherapy you can t beat a workout in water for an array of health benefits many experts say everyone from pro athletes to stroke survivors are benefitting from aquatic exercise that combines walking or running against the natural resistance of the water to help build strength and endurance running and walking in water is an excellent form of physical therapy for people rehabilitating from hip knee and back injuries and surgeries it s also an easy on the joints form of exercise for seniors and others who suffer from arthritis and a recent study shows it can speed recovery from stroke faster than using a traditional treadmill it s just an all around good aerobic conditioner for athletes too sports medicine expert dr naresh rao told cbs news rao is the olympic team usa water polo physician for the summer games we ve been using hydrotherapy to help decrease any sort of gravity that can affect joint function said rao who is also with the department of family medicine at plainview hospital in plainview new york i personally prescribe it for knee issues and low back issues hydrotherapy uses a water friendly treadmill that can be placed in a pool another method involves a specially designed treadmill tank matt johnson a physical therapist at st luke s hospital in bethlehem pennsylvania told cbs news that the tank is basically a freestanding tub about six feet long by three feet wide with a motorized belt the water height can be adjusted to the patient s abilities the buoyancy of the water helps someone who s been injured to walk and run a little sooner than they d be able to do on dry ground he explained in water we can teach them sooner they can really work on their gait walk without pain do exercises in water that you wouldn t be able to do on land said johnson a physical therapy patient at st luke s in bethlehem pennsylvania participates in water therapy in a hydro track system by conray incorporated physical therapy at st luke s hospital bethlehem pa he uses a hydrotrack underwater treadmill system professional sports teams including the new york yankees and the miami dolphins have used it too the nice thing about it said johnson is that people can step right into the tank at ground level and then the water fills up around them it works like a lock on a canal he said so even older patients with limited mobility and balance don t have to negotiate getting down into a pool johnson starts off recuperating athletes and patients in water somewhere between waist and chest height the treadmill speed can be set anywhere from to miles per hour depending on how much resistance a person can handle at waist height it s at about percent of body weight at chest height it s about percent of body weight johnson said noting for example that a person with an injured knee who weighs pounds who is running in waist high water would only feel like pounds on the bad knee taking some of that pressure off the knee helps them tolerate that knee injury longer said johnson a recent study in the american journal of physical medicine and rehabilitation showed that water workouts might benefit stroke survivors researchers asked patients who d had a stroke within the past two months to undergo two treadmill exercise tests one submerged in water and one on a regular treadmill they gradually increased walking speed and slope over time until the patients couldn t go any further walking on the underwater treadmill produced better measures when it came to maximal oxygen consumption vo max a reflection of heart and lung function during exercise and metabolic equivalents a measure of energy use the study proposes a different very innovative approach to rehabilitation after stroke said dr gisele wolf klein director of geriatric education at northwell health in great neck new york wolfe klein told cbs news she has tried water workouts and said you don t even feel like you break a sweat even if your heart rate is up it s a very pleasant way of achieving exactly what you re trying to do allowing a cardio respiratory response wolfe klein told cbs news she noted that medicine s veterinary counterparts have been using water therapy for years with injured racehorses michael phelps simone manuel make history in rio budd coates training director at runner s world magazine said runners don t just plunge into water therapy when they re injured it s a great conditioning method for healthy athletes too some recreational swimming pools and homeowners with backyard pools have manual treadmills that are water safe and can be plunked right in the water an alternative to a water treadmill some pool companies will install a water flow system you can work out against it creates a water force and helps keep you jogging in place said coates for those without access to a water treadmill you can purchase a foam vest specifically designed for water jogging or use foam barbells to help keep you afloat some pools may loan them out too or coates suggested just try it freeform with waist or chest high water to start if you have trouble getting in out of a recreational pool look for one that has a slanting beach style entry into the water or one with a robotic chair lift ask a pool lifeguard or certified swim instructor to help you if running s not your thing but the water looks inviting coates said there are also spin bikes that can be used underwater coates said the beauty of water running or even walking is that it s great for any age and any level of ability from elderly stroke survivors to olympic athletes galen rupp the rio olympics men s marathon bronze medalist relies on it as part of his training he and some of the other guys on the nike team it s well known they take advantage of the anti gravity treadmill and the aqua track coates said,1
photo personal health jane brody on health and aging ever since the large government study called the women s health initiative found a number of risks associated with menopause hormones millions of women who are in or near menopause have been weathering hot flashes and other symptoms on their own but now new research suggests that the benefits of short term hormone treatment to control life disrupting menopausal symptoms outweigh the risks as long as the treatment is started at or near menopause there are also lots of products now available and different ways to use them that enhance the safety of hormone replacement and there is even an app to help women and their doctors explore various options and choose the most suitable treatment for women without a history of cancer blood clots or heart disease most professional medical societies concerned with women s health now recommend treatment for menopausal symptoms for up to five years using therapy that combines estrogen and progesterone and even longer for those who take estrogen alone every day about women in the united states more than two million women a year enter menopause at an average age of they stop having their periods because their ovaries no longer produce enough estrogen to stimulate growth of the uterine lining that is shed each menstrual cycle for months before and up to a decade or more after menopause begins many women have symptoms that can seriously diminish the quality of their lives by disrupting their productivity sleep moods and ability to enjoy sexual intercourse the most common symptom hot flashes can leave some women dripping with sweat for minutes at a time several times a day and especially during the night menopause related vaginal dryness and atrophy can result in severe sexual discomfort pain and bleeding with exercise vaginal and urinary infections and incontinence until the early s many women with menopausal symptoms took hormone replacement therapy h r t to counter them even some who did not have disturbing symptoms used h r t because observational studies indicated it lowered the risk of cardiovascular diseases and popular books and articles suggested it delayed signs of aging then in the results of the largest randomized clinical trial of hormone replacement the women s health initiative w h i created a kind of menopausal panic prompting millions of middle age women to stop or not start hormone treatments and doctors to not prescribe them the study found that among the women treated with the hormones there was an increased risk of heart attacks strokes blood clots and most frightening of all to many women a slightly higher risk of breast cancer among those randomized to take the leading h r t regimen of conjugated equine estrogens premarin and a synthetic progesterone provera recommended for women who still had a uterus those without a uterus who were randomized to take conjugated estrogens alone had no increase in breast cancer in fact they had a slight decrease over all the hormone combination did protect against hip fractures and reduce the risk of colorectal cancer but for the overwhelming majority of menopausal women the risks of h r t seemed on the surface to outweigh the benefits however according to dr joann e manson an endocrinologist and one of the principal investigators for the w h i the w h i findings have been seriously misunderstood and misinterpreted and millions of women for whom the benefits clearly outweigh the risks are needlessly being denied treatment the pendulum has swung too far she said the w h i study actually had nothing to do with menopausal symptoms most of the women entering the study were already in their s and s already a decade or more past menopause rather the study was designed to determine whether h r t did in fact reduce the risk of heart disease the leading killer of american women among these older women it found no such effect in the years after the w h i findings many new analyses and studies have prompted experts to rethink the wisdom of avoiding hormone replacement especially for women within a few years of menopause whose personal and family history do not place them at high risk of breast cancer experts like dr manson professor of medicine at harvard medical school and brigham women s hospital maintain that the results of the w h i study are not relevant to the more common use of h r t for women in their s and for those experiencing earlier menopause as a result of medical treatments dr howard n hodis a preventive cardiologist at the university of southern california said the billion dollar w h i study made a big mistake by starting the hormones in older women when cardiovascular damage may have already occurred the cardiovascular protection found in observational studies involved women who were younger and within a few years of menopause when they started taking h r t he said in a danish randomized controlled trial of women entering menopause among those given hormones for years there was a reduction in cardiovascular disease and breast cancer a clear benefit with nominal risk dr hodis said these benefits persisted after years of follow up according to the study which was published in dr hodis is especially disturbed about the reluctance to prescribe estrogens for menopausal women who have had a hysterectomy and don t need progesterone to prevent endometrial cancer in an analysis in in the american journal of public health dr philip m sarrel and his co authors calculated that based on reduced death rates among women taking only estrogen in the w h i study avoiding hormone replacement resulted in the premature deaths of to women in the decade after the study s release dr manson is distressed about the large number of women about a third of those now on hormone replacement who are relying on custom compounded products that have not been reviewed for safety and effectiveness by the food and drug administration they come with no warnings in a package insert and could contain contaminants and inconsistent dosages she said there s little or no reason to go the custom compound route she said women today have so many options a wide array of doses from low to traditional and ways to use them in addition to pills there are patches gels and sprays applied to the skin vaginal and urinary symptoms can be treated with vaginal inserts containing very small amounts of estrogen that do not enter the bloodstream and thus are safe for women who have had breast cancer to help women and their doctors assess h r t options and select the best treatment for women and older with menopausal symptoms the north american menopause society has developed a mobile app menopro for iphone ipad and android devices related

for women older than who have been confused by conflicting advice on how frequently to get a mammogram some new science is here to guide their decisions an ambitious research effort published monday in the annals of internal medicine set out to tailor women s breast cancer screening practices to match their actual risk of breast cancer it concludes that a woman s breast density should influence the frequency with which she is screened for breast cancer in addition to such long recognized breast cancer risk factors as age ethnicity personal history of abnormal breast findings and a family history of breast cancer for a small slice of those women that makes a once a year mammogram twice as often as the current standard the best bet underwritten by the national cancer institute the new study combined the data collection efforts of breast cancer epidemiologists with three separate teams of cancer modelers in the study women were separated into subcategories based on four levels each of individual risk and breast density advertisement the research recommends that women older than with dense breast tissue who have higher than normal risk of developing breast cancer should get annual mammograms these women however represent a small minority of women in that age group less than of all women between and many women however could go as long as three years between mammograms without increasing their risk of death from breast cancer the study found for women with average risk and low breast density the models showed that there was no difference in deaths averted from breast cancer whether they were screened every two years or every three years women who had a mammogram every three years however had fewer unnecessary follow up procedures including biopsies accepted clinical guidelines recommend that women to get a mammogram every two years these recommendations first proposed in by a federal task force urged women to discuss with their physicians whether more frequent screening might be in order but they have continued to be controversial with some activist and medical groups that believe additional lives could be saved if more women got an annual mammogram the latest study largely validates the controversial recommendations made by the u s preventive services task force in but it also clarifies which women should or could depart safely from its recommendations advertisement only in the last decade or so have radiologists oncologists and women s health specialists begun to appreciate the role of breast density in a woman s breast cancer risk while radiologists have long warned that dense breast tissue made cancerous masses harder to spot mounting evidence has found that cancer is also more likely to gain a foothold in dense breast tissue the latest effort is the first to produce a risk calculator that takes that into account and asks for a radiologist s standardized assessment of breast density in its six point questionnaire many states now require radiologists reading mammograms to assign and communicate to a woman and her physician this density measure called a breast imaging reporting and data system or bi rads score overall the risk measure calculates a woman s likelihood of developing breast cancer over five and years and compares it to normal risk in devising their models the researchers updated assumptions that have cast doubt on the relevance of existing breast cancer risk calculators which relied on the experiences of women who got an earlier generation of screening mammograms and were more likely to die of breast cancer than is currently the case here teams of modelers from erasmus university in the netherlands albert einstein college of medicine in new york and harvard pilgrim healthcare assumed that women were getting digital mammograms which offer improved cancer detection rates at lower radiation dosages than earlier mammographic methods they took into account improved rates of breast cancer treatment effectiveness and changing causes of mortality for women older than they also took account of the fact that breast density decreases in older women these models are very applicable to the populations we screen said uc san francisco breast cancer specialist dr karla kerlikowske one of the lead authors of the new study the practice of tailoring screening intervals to a woman s breast cancer risk is already widespread in some european countries including sweden the netherlands and spain a spanish study similar to the latest modeling effort found that implementing a general three year screening interval with yearly screening for high risk women reduced overdiagnosis and caught more missed cancers some lesions detected in screening will never grow to become clinically significant and will not impact a woman s life kerlikowske said advertisement follow me on twitter latmelissahealy and like los angeles times science health on facebook more in science scientists

if a pill could prevent teenagers from taking dangerous risks would you consider it for your children i d be tempted my skateboard and bicycle riding son was hit by a car twice when he was a teenager i would have welcomed anything that could have averted those dreadful phone calls from the emergency room while some bumps and scares are inevitable for active guys like him serious misadventures with long lasting repercussions are often par for the course for a subset of them those with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder or adhd but a new article suggests that early medication can significantly cut the odds of bad things happening later affecting nearly of all americans between and years of age adhd is one of the most common childhood disorders and also one of the most misunderstood its symptoms color almost every aspect of a child s life from being able to focus in school to making and keeping friends reining in fleeting impulses and assessing risk and danger indeed accidents are the most common cause of death in individuals with adhd with one study of over danish children finding that to year olds with adhd were far more likely to be injured than other children their age drug treatment made a big difference however nearly halving the number of emergency room visits by children with adhd medicating children to address problems with attention and self control remains controversial adhd isn t visible like chickenpox nor immediately life threatening like asthma its distortion of a child s ability to meet adults expectations creates an atmosphere of frustration and blame so it s not often taken for what it really is a neurodevelopmental disorder with genetic roots an enduring myth about adhd is that children grow out of it in adolescence we now know that a year old with a bona fide attentional disorder may well become a dreamy restless and impulsive teenager and adult adolescents with adhd think even less about consequences than the average teenager and are especially thrilled by novelty they re more likely than their friends to drink too much drive like maniacs abuse drugs and have unprotected sex it s a sobering list but an article published last month by princeton researchers anna chorniy and leah kitashima in the journal labour economics shows that treating adhd with medication during childhood can head off later problems we have years of data for every child enrolled in south carolina medicaid who was diagnosed with adhd dr chorniy told me the researchers tracked each doctor visit and every prescription with a sample of over children whose health progress they tracked into adulthood this long view let the economists compare the behaviors of teens treated with the most common adhd medications such as ritalin concerta and adderall to the types of risks taken by other children with adhd who were not treated the researchers found fewer and less severe injuries and health problems among the treated children a reduction in sexually transmitted infections fewer children who sought screening for sexually transmitted infections suggesting they had had an unprotected sexual tryst and fewer teen pregnancies that adds up to a lot fewer teenagers in trouble the economists did their study based on existing data but randomized controlled studies experiments carefully designed to establish cause and effect relationships have reached the same conclusion that medication to control adhd can reduce the high price in psychic pain loss of educational opportunity and riven relationships a child whose disorder is diagnosed and treated early by a trained clinician stands a better chance of growing into a healthy and thoughtful adult,1

alzheimer s disease the most common form of dementia can be fully cured with an anti inflammatory drug commonly used for period pain a new research by the university of manchester shows currently no drug medications can successfully treat chronic neurodegenerative disease but certain medicines can help alleviate symptoms or slow down the progression researchers who conducted the study on mice found that mefenamic acid a common non steroidal anti inflammatory drug nsaid used to relieve menstrual pain can completely reverse memory loss and brain inflammation that are hallmark changes of alzheimer s which currently affects over five million americans for the study researchers used transgenic mice that develop symptoms of alzheimer s disease the research was conducted when mice had developed memory problems they were divided in groups of first group was given mefenamic acid dose and the other group was given placebo for one month through a mini pump implanted under the skin researchers observed that memory loss was fully reversed to the levels seen in mice without alzheimer s there is experimental evidence now to strongly suggest that inflammation in the brain makes alzheimer s disease worse our research shows for the first time that mefenamic acid a simple nsaid can target an important inflammatory pathway called the nlrp inflammasome which damages brain cells david brough lead author of the study said in a statement brough however cautioned that further research is required to identify its impact on humans and the long term implications however much more work needs to be done until we can say with certainty that it will tackle the disease in humans as mouse models don t always faithfully replicate the human disease because this drug is already available and the toxicity and pharmacokinetics of the drug is known the time for it to reach patients should in theory be shorter than if we were developing completely new drugs brough said researchers said that the lab results identify a class of existing drugs that are likely to treat alzheimer s by blocking a particular part of the immune response but they also warned that these drugs are not without side effects and should not be taken for alzheimer s disease at this stage studies in people are needed first the research was published in the journal nature communications on thursday,1
researchers out of the university of leicester have developed a new asthma pill for the first time in years which they believe will significantly improve symptoms for those with severe asthma the drug known as fevipiprant qaw was shown to reduce asthma symptoms as well as inflammation and it improved lung function and repaired airway linings the pill may be a game changer for future treatment of asthma said professor chris brightling a national institute for health research nihr senior research fellow at the university of leicester in a press release in the study the researchers examined participants who were divided into two groups the first was given mg of the drug twice a day for weeks and the second group was given a placebo by measuring the sputum eosinophil the inflammation marker that shows how white blood cells increase during asthma attacks the researchers were able to track the effects of the drug when asthma symptoms occur the number of white blood cells rises and this measurement is used to define how severe the condition is for people with asthma a sputum eosinophil reading will typically be around five percent compared to people without asthma who have readings that are lower than one percent pixabay public domain as the researchers tracked the participants over the course of weeks they found that those taking the drug saw a decrease in their sputum eosinophil reading from an average of percent to percent a unique feature of this study was how it included measurements of symptoms lung function using breathing tests sampling of the airway wall and ct scans of the chest to give a complete picture of how the new drug works said brightling in the press release most treatments might improve some of these features of disease but with fevipiprant improvements were seen with all the types of tests we already know that using treatments to target eosinophilic airway inflammation can substantially reduce asthma attacks ultimately the researchers hope that the drug could likewise help to stop preventable asthma attacks reduce hospital admissions and improve day to day symptoms making it a game changer for future treatment said brightling source brightling c et al the lancet respiratory medicine,0
many heart doctor will tell you that one of the best ways to keep your heart healthy is to include more healthy oils such as omega fatty acids found in fish in your diet studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease and fewer heart attacks though the same can t necessarily be true of those who take supplements see this piece fish oil is hugely popular but should you take it for more on that one thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack can omega fat provide similar benefit researchers led by dr raymond kwong at brigham and women s hospital wanted to find out so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it s changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now for the study published in the journal circulation they studied nearly people who recently had a heart attack who were randomly assigned to take g of omega fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months that s a high dose a oz portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to g of omega every two months the volunteers came in for an mri of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing normally after a heart attack part of the heart is starved of oxygen and that portion never recovers the remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue but has to work harder to maintain the heart s normal pumping function over time this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue s ability to do its job kwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega fats showed less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo what s more the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega fats people absorb it at different rates showed the greatest reduction in scarring compared to those with the lowest levels the effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs including cholesterol lowering statins and blood pressure medications the omega fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack says kwong based on analysis of their blood samples the people taking omega supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack it s the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart after a heart attack the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved the stronger the heart will be kwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response the g is a high dose previous studies in which people were given g of fish oil were more inconsistent most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner how much omega is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way these are questions kwong and others hope to answer with more studies kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack to say every heart attack patient should be taking omega fatty acids right away is a bit premature he says but i do think it s logical that our results hold promise and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack contact us at,1
brynne henn leaned back onto a pristine white couch and settled white and red headphones over her ears she picked up a handset grasping one buzzer in each hand closed her eyes and the session began the room was quiet through the headphones henn heard an alternating tone first in the right ear then the left back and forth the handset buzzed in synchrony right left right left part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories she turned her thoughts to the day her brother nate died nate henn had been visiting relatives and working with invisible children a nonprofit in kampala uganda on july he was at a sports complex with friends enjoying the broadcast of a world cup soccer match when terrorists struck nate was only when shrapnel from a bomb ended his life the years hadn t diminished brynne henn s pain your brother s dead and you need to come home to take care of your mom she remembered her father saying with those simple words her brother was gone and she felt compelled to take control in the ensuing chaos henn who had been visiting her boyfriend in chapel hill immediately returned home to raleigh n c i didn t stop for the first week after nate died she said the ordeal didn t end with the news of nate s death her other brother kyle rushed home from delaware to be with the family but the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby chapel hill the pilot was killed and the co pilot was seriously injured but kyle survived and then the media storm went crazy henn said the family already had received inquiries from journalists about nate s death kyle s brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from philadelphia to raleigh it made it so much worse henn said at age she began functioning as the family spokeswoman i felt like i had to protect my family from all of it she said she occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements but after the whirlwind passed unaddressed grief remained with her complicated grief when a person experiences trauma the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened the brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly even in safe situations when henn s traumatic memories of her brother s violent death were triggered they popped and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen all these memories around me started playing like a video loop henn said her body remembered the sensations vividly the heat and discomfort of the summer day the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral henn did cognitive behavioral therapy a form of conventional talk therapy for five years it helped me realize feelings were normal she explained and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy but i never felt like i was getting over it random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear talk therapy helped her manage those attacks but it didn t address the root cause henn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief she was diagnosed with post traumatic stress disorder only last year she was surprised she had thought of ptsd as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events not of people like her suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in uganda it was kyle henn recovering from his own ptsd after surviving the plane crash who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy or emdr psychologist francine shapiro developed emdr in three years later she founded the emdr institute which has trained more than practitioners some therapists use sounds from headphones during a session others use eye movement moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows eyes moving left to right and back again others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another patients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories they describe the memories to the therapist who gives guidance as needed the idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short term to long term memory the sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of rem sleep when the brain usually converts short term memories into long term recollections studies have found benefits to emdr but there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference said stephen holland founder of the capital institute for cognitive therapy and co author of the textbook treatment plans and interventions for depression and anxiety disorders the question is whether stimulation adds to it he does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy brynne henn who lives in the district began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices emdr last september in gail kalin s office nestled in a tree shaded apartment building in northwest washington henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her the techniques associated with emdr may merely have a placebo effect some psychologists say in early sessions henn focused on the headphones and handset they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother s death she said this distraction had a positive effect on her she said allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear some insurance plans cover emdr henn s does not she pays for the sessions out of pocket henn who is a communications associate at a washington research institution was initially very skeptical of emdr it is so weird she said when i first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands and then i put on these giant headphones i was like what is this a hearing test what are we doing but henn was encouraged by the progress she made i started getting really interested in it she said why is my brain coming up with this what in the world are you doing to me that this is what i came up with henn was surprised by the vivid memories some of which she hadn t known existed that resurfaced after so much time had passed reliving the memories it didn t matter to her whether research supported emdr what mattered was whether it worked for her each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced henn said you have to go through it again until it has no meaning by confronting the trauma head on she added it became less powerful it s integrating what s stuck in time explained kalin the psychologist memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest she said emdr processing is untangling the knot once the memories are processed therapists say they are less vivid less like the film reel henn would see in her mind henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic emdr s central appeal lies in the possibility of closure an end to ptsd and to therapy for it i m going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself henn said she already has put these tools to the test two months after she started emdr terrorists hit paris killing at least people soon after that attack she heard reports that a video possibly from the islamic state contained a threat to hit washington next and she had a full fledged panic attack she said i was not sure where i was i was sweating profusely but also really cold she said she stepped onto the th floor terrace at work and looked down the thought came into my head i just need to walk off and that will wake me up henn remembered and i had enough awareness that i sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth actions reminiscent of emdr processing it took a while and it was a little terrifying that i had that thought she said but the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything i had been equipped with before in a few weeks henn mentioned to kalin she would be marrying her college sweetheart beneath the excitement she felt a twinge of panic how would she react to her brother s absence from the wedding she asked a close friend to write a speech from nate s point of view as if he were speaking at the celebration but henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction a fear shared by many who suffer from ptsd they never know when the trauma will reignite it can spread from the smallest spark even on the happiest day does emdr deal with the future she asked kalin kalin nodded and they began processing memories again among the painful recollections henn encountered a happy memory friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family and a smile broke through the tears it felt like a gift from nate she said emdr henn said allowed her to have a do over to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief she was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain i m still sad but i m not hurt by it anymore she said it s not opening up any fresh wounds as henn walked outside into a brisk april evening after her session there was a new easiness to her as though something had finally been freed,1

chicago reuters a computerized brain training program cut the risk of dementia among healthy people by percent u s researchers said on sunday in reporting an analysis of the results of a year study the preliminary findings presented at the alzheimer s association international conference in toronto are the first to show that any kind of intervention could delay the development of dementia in normal healthy adults to date cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists have largely rejected evidence that computer based cognitive training software or brain games have any effect on cognitive function the new findings would be quite promising if they hold up through peer review and publication in a scientific journal said dr john king an expert in social research at the national institute of aging the institute is part of the national institutes of health which funded the study king worked on the original clinical trial on which the new analysis is based the study known as active examined the effects of cognitive training programs on healthy older adults participants were divided into three groups one got training for memory improvement one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed of processing in the speed training which emphasized visual perception individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly the program got harder with each correct answer participants had one hour training sessions conducted in a classroom setting over five weeks some received four additional booster sessions one year after the original training and four more two years after that scientists measured cognitive and functional changes immediately and at one two three five and years after the training to see if it affected how participants performed daily tasks results of that study published in found modest benefits in the reasoning and speed of processing groups but not memory the new analysis was by dr jerri edwards of the university of south florida whose mentor dr karlene ball of the university of alabama at birmingham sold her rights to the program to posit science edwards also was a paid consultant for the company for part of the program is now incorporated in posit science s brainhq com brain training program edwards did a secondary analysis of the year data looking at the time it took individuals to develop dementia she found that the group that did speed training showed percent less risk of dementia relative to the control group while the memory and the reasoning interventions offered no such benefit people who completed or more speed training sessions were at percent less risk for developing dementia over the years of the study edwards said at first blush that s kind of a big deal mayo clinic alzheimer s expert dr ronald petersen said this may even be clinically relevant in a group of nearly neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists led by researchers at stanford university s center on longevity and the berlin max planck institute for human development signed a letter saying there was little evidence of such results from brain games the letter was in response to heavy marketing by companies touting the benefits of their programs based on scant scientific data edwards said she was frustrated with the scientific debate which is one reason she agreed to present her findings before they were published i m sick of our studies being ignored she said king said the training offered in the program was slightly different from the current posit science offering and that it was unclear whether speed training would help people who are already at risk for dementia it s a promising result from an interesting data set he said i do think we will know more after the paper is reviewed,1
ferlistockphoto getty images getting pregnant can be tricky one way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when she s most fertile a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes and certain body tracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics like your heart rate and body temperature depending on the device it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive recently the women s health data startup clue ran an internal test to see if fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant scientists put fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles the devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began according to the berlin company which presented data from the small preliminary study at the european society of human reproduction and embryology s annual meeting this month it s a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant the advantage of a passive sensor is these things are done kind of autonomously so you don t need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up clue s head of scientific research dr vedrana högqvist tabor told buzzfeed news it s a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant fitbits aren t the only wearables that can track fertility related biometrics in the background after a kickstarter campaign yono just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest and ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive fitbit how an activity tracker caught an unexpected pregnancy fitness trackers by nature of being worn around the clock have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days that traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest examining your cervical mucus and recording this data every single day on a calendar clue s study which ran for months beginning in april didn t set out to see whether the fitbit chargehr could identify when a woman becomes pregnant rather it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already known occurrence how a woman s resting heart rate changes when she s experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation for the experiment five women under wore a fitbit chargehr to bed that s because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving the women also logged their periods on clue s app and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles a woman s fertile window when she s likeliest to get pregnant usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period and lasts for about six or seven days ending on the day of ovulation clue as the researchers had hypothesized the participants fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation as well as during ovulation itself so a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner högqvist tabor said and the study had one particularly unexpected outcome clue s marketing director who was participating was puzzled when her fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute högqvist tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant and broke the news to the marketing director she was pregnant the happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year when a man posted on reddit about how his wife s fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate upon a redditor s suggestion she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant an expert told buzzfeed news at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature another symptom of pregnancy but don t think of this as birth control even though clue s marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her fitbit the point of the study was to demonstrate that it s possible to use fitbit as a conception tool not as a pregnancy test högqvist tabor said and that s provided that a couple doesn t have any other fertility related problems manually figuring out your fertile days is a laborious multi step process you have to do every single day however högqvist tabor said this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method a woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a fitbit so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy if you re curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for clue hasn t revealed that information yet but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later högqvist tabor says it s tricky because it depends on the individual and can range from a few beats per minute to beats per minute one reason to potentially shy away from trusting fitbit s heart rate sensors in a class action lawsuit some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate regardless clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices ability to capture the day to day differences in someone s resting heart rate which seemed to be consistent and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate you will get a relative change even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap said clue co founder mike lavigne daniel winkler ava,1

reuters u s health regulators said on tuesday they approved a stent by abbott laboratories that is the first designed to be absorbed into the bloodstream after it is implanted the stent called absorb is made of a plastic similar to dissolving sutures and offers patients an alternative to metal stents currently used to prop open arteries cleared of blockages unlike traditional stents that remain in place after implantation absorb is designed to disappear fully within three years of the procedure absorb s appeal is that it allows the blood vessel to return to a natural state free from a permanent metal implant the approach holds particular promise for patients whose coronary artery disease could require multiple implants over the course of several decades said mitchell krucoff a professor at duke university medical center who has advised abbott on absorb this is a game changer he said in an interview there are no longer going to be permanent metal implants in the artery absorb releases the drug everolimus to combat the growth of scar tissue that can form within a stent and cause the artery to narrow again the u s food and drug administration which approved the stent said no metal means the treated artery can pulse and flex naturally as demands on the heart change with everyday activities said gregg stone of columbia university medical center who led clinical trials for absorb no metal may also reduce the potential of future blockages that occur with permanent metallic stents data released in october concluded absorb was comparable to abbott s own xience drug coated metal stent in safety and effectiveness but showed a higher risk of heart attacks and blood clots abbott said it expects the risks to lessen as surgeons gain experience with it absorb also will compete with medtronic plc s traditional drug coated resolute stent and boston scientific corp s synergy and promus stents synergy s polymer coating disappears over time after delivering a drug that helps prevent the artery from re clogging leaving a metal stent in place abbott plans to roll out the device to about hospitals in the next several months as it trains surgeons on the implant procedure before ramping up sales said spokesman jonathon hamilton absorb will be priced at a modest premium to xience he said analysts have predicted absorb will gain a market niche but not surpass drug dispensing metal stents such as xience in share until longer term data show more favorable clinical results,1
when i tore my rotator cuff in i had conventional laparoscopic surgery to repair it the outcome was excellent but the recovery was long and horrible the orthopedist wouldn t let me drive for six weeks or run swim or lift weights for three months i suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy it was nearly six months before i felt normal again so in after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an mri revealed another rotator cuff tear i vowed i would not go through shoulder surgery or its aftermath again cortisone injections and physical therapy didn t help so i decided to try something else platelet rich plasma a therapy that uses the body s natural healing properties to mend injuries its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics based on my experience with it i think they are right it may not work for every condition or for everyone but it worked for me prp therapy is popular for sports injuries but does it work before undergoing prp treatment i read quite a bit about it learning that it holds promise for healing soft tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder tennis elbow plantar fasciitis achilles tendinitis patella tendinitis and hamstring tears it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis prp works and the results have been amazing says john ferrell the sports medicine physician who treated me there still needs to be more research done to perfect the process but it will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future we will be more preventive we will be able to treat ailments noninvasively and at an earlier stage the procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient s arm spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing platelets the blood cells that promote clotting contain hundreds of proteins called growth factors that are important in repairing injuries prp works by acting like a stem cell magnet says ferrell who practices at regenerative orthopedics sports medicine which has several offices in the washington area it releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come and help regenerate the injured area rotator cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there prp actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal a recent pilot study conducted at the glen sather sports medicine clinic at the university of alberta on rotator cuff tears supports this it showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received prp as well as improvements in their pain and function the researchers call the results clinically relevant despite the study s small size and say the next step should be a larger controlled clinical trial i ve heard some skeptics call prp a cure looking for a disease but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes says marni wesner a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study s authors the potential for benefit from prp is real i had my first appointment with ferrell last october to find out whether prp might help me by then my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year it bothered me while swimming and lifting weights and while getting dressed by performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion ferrell discovered that my left shoulder the site of the tear was considerably weaker than my right he then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor it turned out to be larger than indicated in the static mri pictures i had obtained earlier before deciding whether prp was right for me he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness he injected an anesthetic into the tear then he ran the strength tests again my strength was significantly better this meant that the tear was causing my problems and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain i had the first prp injection on oct it was painful and the aching persisted for about hours i had one bad night followed by an uncomfortable day after that the pain stopped still ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks running was fine he also recommended physical therapy after two weeks after what i went through in those were restrictions i could live with ferrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti inflammatories such as ibuprofen for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage not stifle inflammation other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay we want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work ferrell says because there is not yet enough research on prp and because some studies have shown mixed results insurance will not cover it still it has significant cost savings compared with surgery ferrell says the average treatment is two injections which costs about at his practice whereas rotator cuff surgery runs about he says although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery with additional research insurance may ultimately pay for prp unfortunately there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the food and drug administration to approve such as a drug or device the centrifuges already are licensed and the procedure uses a patient s own blood which is regarded as safe the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons which says prp holds great promise describes the risk as minimal those who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable prp experience someone who does the procedure several times a day not once or twice a month and who has a good success rate ferrell says moreover you see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound he adds by february the ultrasound showed my tear to be about percent healed the remaining tear was quite small ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job i had it on march when i returned to see him on april i was feeling pretty good no pain no problems he rolled in the ultrasound machine and i was not surprised by the results the tear was completely gone,1
when doctors who treat pregnant women recently met to debate the best time to induce labor they came up with a surprising answer weeks three weeks earlier than currently recommended their organization the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists acog has not changed its guidelines on late term pregnancies the guidelines say that doctors may consider elective induction at weeks and should proceed with it at weeks but the question has some doctors reconsidering their assumptions about induction and has sparked criticism by women who contend there is already too much interference with uncomplicated pregnancies the question was presented in may at the yearly acog meeting in washington why not induce everyone at weeks two doctors had been asked to debate errol norwitz chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at tufts university school of medicine and charles lockwood dean of the morsani college of medicine at the university of south florida here s what s being done to lower the maternal death rate my original assumption when asked to participate in this debate lockwood said was that dr norwitz would take the pro side since he has written about the risk of stillbirth after weeks and i would take the con side since older literature suggested that c section rates would likely be higher in the elective induction of labor at weeks charles j lockwood found studies suggesting that elective inductions at weeks decrease caesarean delivery rates and might reduce complications in mothers and infants university of south florida norwitz was a vigorous proponent there is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond weeks in well dated pregnancies he told the doctors and as lockwood reviewed research he found that he was more and more in agreement with that point of view but errol and i decided we would not tell each other which side we were taking in order to conduct independent assessments of the literature and report on our conclusions lockwood said beyond adding an element of suspense this strategy allowed us to come to unbiased conclusions after lockwood found that recent studies suggest that elective inductions at weeks decrease caesarean delivery rates and might reduce the rate of infant and maternal complications what was supposed to be a debate proceeded as a discussion in support of induction before either doctor spoke the audience in a crowded ballroom was polled percent opposed having most women deliver at weeks percent supported it and percent were unsure norwitz argued against simply letting nature take its course nature is a terrible obstetrician he said referring to the continuum of pregnancy and birth the large number of zygotes that never implant the percent lost before weeks and stillbirth and he said the risk of stillbirth and neurological injuries rises after weeks stillbirth is a hugely underappreciated problem he said there are anywhere between to stillbirths a year in the united states there is no benefit to the fetus waiting beyond weeks in well dated pregnancies said errol norwitz chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at tufts university school of medicine tufts medical center lockwood and norwitz s support for induction at weeks not only surprised many of the doctors at the session it also upset those who believe less intervention is the safest route for mother and baby labor may be induced by breaking the amniotic sac or by using hormones called prostaglandins or medication such as oxytocin which can set off contractions labor can begin immediately or take a day or two if it becomes too lengthy caesareans are performed cristen pascucci an advocate for giving women more control over childbirth decisions thinks the doctors remarks suggest that all babies need to be rescued by birth creating an anti woman mentality it s as if women and their babies are fundamentally in opposition to each other and the female body is dangerous by design said pascucci a vice president of the advocacy group improving birth pascucci who is based in lexington ky travels the country speaking and consultingon issues related to birth rights she said the induction recommendation reinforces a century old pre feminist american obstetric view that birth is pathological and the doctor s job is to extract the fetus from the incubator like in the s when every baby was pulled out of its shackled unconscious mother by episiotomy consumer groups such as hers she said have been calling on acog to evolve toward care that is more centered on women it s disheartening to see how hard that s going to be for some physicians to do lockwood and norwitz are aware that there is strong opposition to induction at weeks i think a lot of this gets very emotional norwitz said although both doctors support induction at weeks for all healthy pregnancies lockwood said that obstetricians shouldn t routinely adopt the practice just yet as with any change in standard medical care extensive research is needed before it can be safely and widely adopted even so norwitz thinks that it s a very healthy discussion to have due dates are calculated weeks from the first day of a woman s normal menstrual period and according to acog full term is defined as a pregnancy that lasts between weeks and weeks and six days as he prepared for the debate lockwood created a micro simulation model to predict the outcome of various care decisions and results suggested lower rates of stillbirth caesarean delivery and maternal and neonatal complications for elective induction at weeks that prompted him to take the debate stage as a proponent of early induction still he was surprised by an audience poll at the end of the discussion percent now supported the idea that women deliver at weeks percent remained unsure and only percent were against the idea i didn t understand the pressure to have a c section until i was about to deliver traditional medical thinking assumes that early induction could lead to higher infection rates and the need for a caesarean but norwitz said the evidence doesn t support that rather he said the latest literature suggests that the drugs available to soften the cervix in preparation for contractions help to decrease the caesarean risk adding a small caveat for a small number of first time mothers with unfavorable long and hard cervixes as opposed to cervixes that are soft and receptive to induction the risk of caesarean is increased rebecca dekker who has a doctorate in nursing and founded the website evidence based birth which aims to make research on childbirth more accessible to families and professionals watched a live stream of the session and described the presentations as misleading and the research as flawed she called it concerning and rash for doctors at the meeting to make broad conclusions that could potentially affect at least million women a year in the united states alone norwitz said that the presentations were evidence based this is my interpretation of the published literature he said this is not a personal opinion based on belief or ideology lockwood said he finds push back inevitable and part of the broader scientific process dekker said there were flaws in the research showing that women who received elective induction had lower rates of caesarean delivery for the women who waited for labor to start on its own about half ended up being induced for medical complications they still analyzed the data as if the women had spontaneous labor so it sways the results of the studies she said dekker isn t disputing that there are about stillbirths per year or that this is a concern however she said a centers for disease control and prevention report shows about half of stillbirths occur between and weeks of pregnancy and the other half at later points it s obvious that a blanket policy of week inductions would not affect all of the stillbirths that happen before weeks dekker said adding that the cdc report concludes despite intensive investigations for a substantial number of fetal deaths a specific cause of death cannot be determined and dekker said the public has the misconception that inductions are simple noninvasive procedures pitocin the most commonly used drug for induction is classified as a high alert medication that can increase the risk of patient harm if an error occurs the drug can cause contractions that are too frequent increasing the risk of decreased blood flow and oxygen to the baby she said also the drug can cause the placenta to detach from the uterine wall too early and it can cause the uterine wall to tear for dekker the major benefit of spontaneous labor is avoiding the risks of a medical induction there are clear philosophical differences one early morning in his hospital s labor and delivery unit norwitz said he spoke with a midwife colleague who compared labor to walking through a forest we midwives stand behind the patient and if she gets off the path we coax her back onto it she told him obstetricians are in front of her hacking through the forest esther hausman a certified nurse midwife in concord mass argues for restraint since we don t know exactly what triggers labor why mess with it hausman suggested learning from countries such as denmark or sweden where midwifery is the first line of care and where fetal and maternal mortality rates are lower than in the united states in a cdc report the u s infant mortality rate per births put it in th place among a selection of developed countries finland and japan had the lowest rates per births dekker said that the acog debate should have instead compared the medical model of care to midwife led care midwives are less likely than doctors to induce a woman electively she said and studies have found they intervene less than doctors and have more satisfied patients beverly siegal a retired obstetrician gynecologist in newton mass attended the debate and was among those who changed their thinking on induction what changed my opinion at the end of the presentation was the really convincing argument that there is nothing gained for the baby to stay in beyond weeks siegal said i would personally recommend that any woman with a favorable cervix at weeks be encouraged to get induced of course lockwood said women should be heard finally needless to say it is expectant mothers that should have the final say as to whether to let nature take its course or undertake this potentially salutary but clearly artificial intervention he said but obviously our messages how you talk does make a difference norwitz said,1
a cure for alzheimer s disease ad a condition marked by progressive debilitating cognitive decline that affects more than million americans is the holy grail in disease research one expert dr dale bredesen a professor at the buck institute for research on aging and a professor at the easton laboratories for neurodegenerative disease research at ucla thinks he might have found a way to reverse memory loss a hallmark of the disease in a study published in the journal aging bredesen and colleagues showed how patients who were experiencing age related memory decline showed brain scan improvements after following an approach called metabolic enhancement for neurodegeneration mend a point individualized regimen of diet exercise brain stimulation sleep improvements medication and vitamins and other specific protocols for five to months for example an mri of one patient showed hippocampal volume at the th percentile for his age range prior to mend the hippocampus is a brain area critical for learning and memory that shrinks in alzheimer s patients after months of following the prescribed protocol his hippocampal volume increased to the th percentile the study noted that some of the patients who had to quit working as a result of their memory decline were able to return to work after adopting mend and participants who were struggling at their jobs reported an improvement in job performance lives have been dramatically impacted bredesen told cbs news i m enthusiastic about that and continue to evolve the protocol james e galvin m d m p h a professor of clinical biomedical science at fau s charles e schmidt college of medicine and a professor in the christine e lynn college of nursing who was not involved in the study agreed that personalized approaches such as the mend protocol are the types of approaches needed for this disease going forward it s important to be excited about this approach he told cbs news however galvin cautioned i m not sure about the method the mend protocol outlined in a study in the journal aging calls for interventions to treat conditions that could be associated with alzheimer s such as inflammation stress and diabetes however mend also requires the use of supplements which are not well studied and do not require fda approval not all things from the approach have a lot of scientific support behind them galvin told cbs news but bredesen believes that the only way to treat alzheimer s is to treat all of the underlying problems which may require intervention with supplements nutrition exercise sleep stress reduction these are all critical pieces of this he told cbs news it s about optimizing biochemistry for your genetics whatever it takes but even if mend is effective the program is complex and difficult to follow a buck institute press release on the study stated none of the patients were able to stick to the entire protocol the significant diet and lifestyle changes and multiple pills required each day were the two most common complaints bredesen said that to simplify the program they are connecting patients with health coaches we re trying to make it simpler but we don t want to lose the efficacy he said bredesen noted too that the mend protocol was suitable for patients in the early stages of alzheimer s one participant from the study who had been diagnosed with late stage alzheimer s did not show improvements with the protocol if you told me that your mother is and living in a home i would say that i d want to treat you he said it s about prevention bredesen said that his team has a couple of larger trials planned to confirm or refute the results in the current study and to address key questions about how long results can be maintained and how late in the course of cognitive decline reversal is possible galvin agrees that more research is necessary before any conclusive results can be reported this is moving in the right direction he told cbs news these anecdotal case reports provide a nice point to start a discussion,1
researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing photo illustration by natalie matthews ramo photos by prudkov and thinkstock it s notoriously hard to treat depression in kids the antidepressants we rely on to treat adults seem to be less effective and more dangerous when used on younger minds new research out of oxford helps confirm this and then some the researchers meta analysis on how commercially available antidepressants compare with a placebo showed that just one of the antidepressants examined was significantly better than a placebo in treating depression in children and adolescents the only drug to pass the test was fluoxetine sold in the u s under the trade name prozac it outperformed all other antidepressants in both efficacy and tolerability a term that researchers use to mean how often patients had to quit the drug due to negative side effects prozac is also the only antidepressant approved by the food and drug administration to treat depression in people under that s because the fda has deemed that prozac has demonstrated benefits that outweigh one of the suspected downsides of antidepressants in kids and teens disrupting brain development dr andrea cipriani psychiatrist and lead author on the study says these are concerns that practicing psychiatrists confront daily from a clinical point of view we tend to be very cautious when prescribing medication to children and adolescents because of the unknown effects on the developing brain he said there s good reason for this researchers have long worried about the effects of psychoactive drugs on people whose brains are still developing back in researchers at harvard medical school released a study that sought to answer questions about the safety of certain drugs and chemicals including antidepressants in adolescents the study which used rats in lieu of human children found evidence that reward pathways are severely altered following exposure to drugs that affect the brain research on how antidepressants actually affect human children s brain development is extremely hard to come by given the limited numbers of actual children on antidepressants and the complications of gaining consent to study them but other research on antidepressants suggest they negatively affect brain plasticity and memory something that would be problematic while the brain is still developing and there s another major problem with the use of many antidepressants in children they may increase suicidal thoughts and behavior since the fda has advised that antidepressants not be prescribed to individuals under due to the increased risk in suicidality especially during the early phases of treatment dr mina fazel child psychiatrist at the oxford university children s hospital says it s complicated because you re giving antidepressants when you re very worried about that young person s mood essentially the moment when it seems most necessary to prescribe the drugs may also be the moment when the patient is most at risk of suicide untangling this cause and effect has thus far eluded researchers though there is some evidence to suggest that antidepressants spark a chemical reaction in the brain that does in fact increase the risk of suicide so far the fda is erring on the side of caution a comment attached to the oxford paper written by dr jon jureidini a child psychiatrist at the women s and children s hospital in adelaide australia goes even further in decrying the use of antidepressants in kids only if the discounted benefit outweighs the boosted harm should the treatment be prescribed he writes for antidepressants in adolescents this equation will rarely favor prescribing in younger children almost never to be clear jureidini believes there is almost never a justification for prescribing antidepressants to children or adolescents i called him to be sure they re not better than nothing he said and there s quite clear evidence that they re more dangerous than nothing he arrived at this conclusion after applying the customary dose of skepticism doctors are taught to apply when translating research findings to clinical practice his wariness of antidepressants being prescribed for kids prozac included is further bolstered by the theory that these drugs don t work well in children because they weren t designed for children they were designed for adults and adults have very different physiological states than adolescents the oxford paper notes that percent of children ages and nearly percent of teenagers ages suffered from major depressive disorder the psychiatric term for what is colloquially known as depression given the u s population that works out to more than a million children and adolescents the disease manifests differently in kids whereas adults might report feeling apathetic unmotivated unfocused and just plain sad children with this disorder tend to be irritable and aggressive and as a result have trouble navigating social situations with adults and peers that means that one of the first battles in treating depression in kids is recognizing it in the first place of course having an effective intervention once it is recognized would help if there s an upside to be found in how ineffective antidepressants likely are for kids it s that pharmacological solutions are not the recommended first line of defense anyway guidelines from the psychiatric associations in most countries recommend that doctors first try psychotherapy or talk therapy which is has been shown to work at least by participants own assessment of their depression levels it s very hard to test therapy against a placebo for obvious reasons methods such as cognitive behavioral therapy in which psychiatrists help patients overcome destructive behaviors and thought patterns and interpersonal therapy which focuses more on the effect depression has on relationships seem to be equally effective in treating depression particularly in adolescents of course this is a high cost intervention in terms of both dollars and time invested and it may not always be readily available but the upside is that there is no reason to believe it is harmful like in nearly all areas of science biomedical or otherwise our understanding is limited and further research is required to find out more about both potential treatment options adolescent depression is particularly difficult since gaining consent to study interventions in children is more complicated than it is in adults if we are to answer these big unknowns regarding the safety of antidepressants in young patients critical because therapy and medication are more effective together than in isolation we need more data,1
a scientist s dream fulfilled harnessing the immune system to fight cancer enlarge this image toggle caption scott dalton for npr scott dalton for npr sharon belvin s nightmare with cancer began in when she was just belvin was an avid runner but said she suddenly found she couldn t climb the stairs without a lot of difficulty breathing eventually after months of fruitless treatments for lung ailments like bronchitis she was diagnosed with melanoma a very serious skin cancer it had already spread to her lungs and the prognosis was grim she had about a chance of surviving the next six months yeah that was the turning point of life right there she says what belvin didn t know at the time was that a revolutionary treatment for melanoma had begun testing in clinical trials an immunologist named jim allison now at the university of texas md anderson cancer center had figured out that if the immune system was tweaked just right it could do a better job of killing the cancer than the usual treatments joe palca worked for allison early in both men s careers allison s treatment was still experimental but if it worked it had the potential to save belvin s life it s a new modality for treating cancer dr samuel broder a former director of the national cancer institute says now of allison s pioneering research it used to be there were three basic treatment options for cancer surgery radiation and chemotherapy or some combination of those three it s fair to say there s now a fourth option allison s long search for this new kind of treatment one that has since become a lifesaver for some cancer patients began around a decade before belvin got sick when allison was running a lab at the university of california berkeley at the time he was what you could call a research scientist s research scientist he was fascinated by certain powerful cells of the immune system t cells a subset of white blood cells t cells travel around the body and can protect us against just about anything allison says t cells do recognize cancer cells but not in a way that can eliminate the disease allison had been studying t cells for years and thought that by tinkering with one key molecule on the outside of these cells he could enhance their response to cancer enough to eradicate the illness he and one of his grad students ran an experiment to test the tweaked t cells on cancerous tumors in mice and the initial results astounded them the t cells seemed to be doing just what allison had hoped they would do shrink the tumors and kill the cancer allison repeated the experiment with more mice over his winter break after a few tense days the tumors again disappeared these mice were cured allison says cancer cured i ve been doing this sort of stuff for years and i d never seen anything like that allison says and i thought if we could do that in people this is going to be amazing allison tried to persuade drugmakers to create a human version of the treatment that had worked in mice he thought they would jump at the chance to try a new approach but the biotech companies he met with didn t bite in those days most firms were focused on drugs that would target tumors directly and allison was asking them to try something very different this was targeting the immune system not the cancer he says we weren t trying to kill the cancer cells we were letting the t cells kill the cancer cells thanks but no thanks the companies told him i got very depressed allison says he was sure this was the most important work of his career but he had to get others on board eventually a scientist attending one of allison s research talks was intrigued enough to contact a pal at the biotech firm medarex the company had recently developed technology that could make a human version of allison s therapy and was willing to give it a try it took a decade but eventually allison s big idea was ready for testing in people a clinical trial to study the drug now called ipilimumab or ippy for short was set up at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york city allison decided he wanted to be part of this next chapter in the testing of immunotherapy so he packed up his california lab and moved it to sloan kettering as it happens belvin was also in new york a patient of dr jedd wolchok at sloan kettering by the fall of belvin had run through all the treatment options available to her nothing had worked to control the melanoma it continued to spread dangerously throughout her body belvin remembers feeling sick and depressed and says she wasn t even paying much attention when wolchok walked into the exam room and suggested one last treatment sharon we have an opportunity to participate in a clinical trial here it s something you should consider wolchok told her belvin says she signed up without hesitation after just four injections of ippy across three months her cancer was nearly gone and at belvin s follow up appointment a year later wolchok delivered news that was hard for her to take in sharon you no longer have cancer and in the next breath belvin recalls he goes oh the guy who invented this is upstairs do you want to meet him yes of course i want to meet him she told her doctor wolchok called allison who was working nearby and told him to drop everything and come to the clinic a part of the hospital allison had rarely seen though the research scientist couldn t imagine why wolchok was in such a rush he quickly figured it out as he opened the door and was greeted by belvin with a huge hug belvin says she tried not to tackle him it was hard to control myself she says i owe this man my life belvin was the first recipient of the immunotherapy that allison had ever met it really meant a lot he says it reminded me what it s all about at the end of the day that was in today sharon belvin is still cancer free ippy is now sold under the brand name yervoy by bristol myers squibb which bought medarex in meanwhile jim allison has become a bit of a celebrity in the cancer research world among other honors he was a recipient of the prestigious lasker award for his achievements in medical science he s become well known among patients too now and again allison fields calls from patients yearning to learn from the master himself what it will take to cure their disease allison can t really answer them each case is different and using a patient s own cells to destroy tumors won t work in every patient or in every type of cancer still the approach offers promise to some people that other therapies can t and has transformed the way doctors think about cancer treatment it might be too early to say we re going to cure cancer allison says but we re going to cure certain types of cancers we ve got a shot at it now,1
when it comes to health i m skeptical of willpower sure i talk to my students about personal responsibility but when it comes to the health of populations i look for big fixes more than for small acts of will that s why my ears perked up when i heard that two old physician friends had decided to start taking as a preventive measure some of the medications often included in what the field has dubbed the polypill my friends are both top doctors in their s with good diet and lifestyle and this is now part of their personal health regimen a polypill might include any of several things a baby aspirin a statin to rebalance cholesterol a drug to control blood pressure and one to lower blood sugar a version less comprehensive than this is available online with a doctor s prescription at polypill com whatever the combination the doses are low so it s relatively safe it s like a multivitamin but with serious medications some public health advocates now argue that everyone over should be on one you read that right everyone if we had perfectly healthy lifestyles these drugs would not be needed but we don t and even if we did the drugs might add further protection one review of the research on polypills comes from melvin lafeber and his colleagues at the university medical center utrecht netherlands writing in current hypertension reports in april they found reason to think that treatment might help higher risk individuals and urged more clinical trials if moderate and high risk people benefit the idea of offering treatment to everybody older than years might raise widespread interest they wrote the polypill they concluded could be an important tool to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease and make it more likely that patients take the necessary drugs critics worry about medicalizing whole populations predicting that the pill would encourage bad habits and worsen health disparities a fixed dose combination pill is one size fits all which doctors don t usually regard as the best medicine but polypills might solve real problems the drugs in them are cheap and target illnesses that afflict many millions around the world and even patients with tailored prescriptions often fail to keep up with the various medicines some of the component drugs are now being evaluated for use with lower risk populations that is people who don t already have serious problems with their blood pressure blood sugar or cholesterol though not a polypill experiment per se a study published in may in the new england journal of medicine involved people over five years one group got two drugs to lower blood pressure and cholesterol the other got placebos in the group taking both drugs died or had health crises in the placebo group did the doses were low so the adverse effects were modest this doesn t mean that we should all be on the polypill but some sensible experts including my two doctor friends are moving toward this sort of preventive approach for people who aren t ill or at high risk after all many of us are already taking low dose aspirin which is possibly the riskiest of these drugs i tend to favor this sort of blunt comprehensive approach to public health much as i like menacing cigarette package warnings urging personal responsibility i like cigarette taxes more despite their regressive impact i love drive carefully signs but i like seat belts better and i like air bags best no judgment no decision no defiant will as for driving under the influence breathalyzer tests and taking keys away beat the heck out of admonitions to be sober and find a designated driver human nature is not our ally in maintaining health with heart disease and stroke many millions of lives are at stake and for me it comes down to this will popping a polypill work better than willpower i suspect that the answer may turn out to be yes,0
patients will potentially be able to avoid medications that do not help them and the test could start a new era for personalised treatment of depression scientists have developed a blood test that could identify which people with depression will respond to treatment so that patients can avoid spending months taking antidepressants that do not help them the experts involved believe the breakthrough could lead to depressed patients receiving personalised treatments that are more likely to relieve their symptoms the royal college of psychiatrists said that if it worked the test could prove to be a key moment in the quest for the holy grail of biological psychiatry the scientists at king s college london behind the development claim that their test accurately and reliably predicts whether depressed patients will respond to common antidepressants which could herald a new era of personalised treatment for people with depression if the test proves effective it is hoped that by measuring patients level of blood inflammation it would identify which of them would benefit from receiving antidepressants soon after their diagnosis to stop their condition worsening what does depression feel like trust me you really don t want to know tim lott read more about half of all patients with depression get no benefit from antidepressants the first time they take them and they never work for one in three people currently it is impossible to establish who should or should not be given antidepressants or combinations of them that means that patients are tried on a succession of different drugs for weeks or more and experience prolonged periods of ineffective treatment because their medication does not benefit them one in six britons will suffer depression at some point in their life last year m prescriptions for antidepressants were issued in england researchers focused on two independent clinical groups of depressed patients on two biological markers that measure inflammation of the blood as heightened levels are associated with poor response to antidepressants they found that blood test results above certain levels reliably predicted how well patients would respond to commonly prescribed antidepressants their findings have been reported in the international journal of neuropsychopharmacology the identification of biomarkers that predict treatment response is crucial in reducing the social and economic burden of depression and improving quality of life for patients said prof carmine pariante from kcl s institute of psychiatry psychology and neuroscience this study provides a clinically suitable approach for personalising antidepressants therapy patients who have blood inflammation above a certain threshold could be directed towards earlier access to more assertive antidepressant strategies including the addition of other antidepressants or anti inflammatory drugs pariante added dr cosmo hallstrom a spokesman for the royal college of psychiatrists said finding biological markers for depression and other mental illnesses has been the holy grail of biological psychiatry such a finding and a test to back it up would be critical to advancing our understanding of the biological causes of depression it would accelerate our therapeutic interventions and make them more tailored to the needs of the patient but further clinical research is needed to see if the findings can be applied in a clinical setting hallstrom added stephen buckley head of information at the mental health charity mind said we welcome research which adds to our understanding of treatments and medications that may work for people experiencing mental health problems these initial findings are interesting but as with all areas of mental health there is still more research to be done mental health problems including depression are estimated to cost bn a year in england the world health organisation has predicted that by depression will be the second biggest cause of health problems in the world,1

scientists have raised the possibility of using statins drugs used for reducing cholesterol to stop some breast cancer tumours returning the most common form of breast cancer uses oestrogen to grow drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery but about of the diagnosed oestrogen receptor positive er positive cancers still recur every year study points toward personalised treatment for breast cancer read more early research most of it still in the lab published in the journal breast cancer research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called hydroxycholesterol hc it can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow dr lesley ann martin at the institute of cancer research in london where the research has been carried out said during the course of treatment er positive breast cancers that are fed by oestrogen often become resistant to standard hormone therapy our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it this is hugely significant testing the patient s tumour for hc or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy and tailor their treatment accordingly our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials the research has not yet been tested in humans the scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel in the form of the cholesterol molecule they then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells growth by between and the scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti cancer drugs cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why er positive breast cancers recur but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings delyth morgan chief executive at breast cancer now which funded the research said this is a really crucial discovery far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today s most commonly used treatments this study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti hormone treatments but this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach another charity breast cancer care said the research was promising but needed further trials this early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterol reducing treatment such as statins could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy said jane murphy clinical nurse specialist we know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment this discovery may in future help reduce these concerns for some patients by allowing doctors to test if their cancer is likely to return and tailor treatment accordingly,1
for million american women of child bearing age getting pregnant is not an easy task specialists now have a way to test the parents to be that may not only increase their chances of getting pregnant but also reduce the risk of them passing on certain genetic diseases when we do pre implantation genetic screening we can ensure that the embryos are chromosomally normal before transferring them back to the intended mother s uterus and that increases the likelihood of implantation dr jared robbins an associated professor in obstetrics and gynecology reproductive endo infertility at northwestern university feinberg school of medicine told fox news according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc birth defects caused by genetic disorders affect one in every births in the united states the test results may limit the chances of an embryo carrying a chromosomal disorder from being implanted we can t fix the embryos yet but we can determine which embryos are affected by the disease and which aren t and only transfer back those that are not affected robbins who is also a fertility doctor at northwestern memorial hospital said a diagnosis before pregnancy may sound like a designer baby but doctors say that s not the case we have the technology and ability to eradicate diseases that have ravaged families for decades dr kaylen silverberg of texas fertility center told fox news they ve lost family members generation after generation after generation or they ve had family members who ve suffered from chronic disease that s totally preventable these procedures not only help limit the passing on of diseases they may also help couples get pregnant faster we re getting significantly higher pregnancy rates significantly lower miscarriage rates silverberg said these results have helped eliminate pre term birth and hospitalizations for pre term labor and patients and families have better outcomes he added pre implantation genetic screening doesn t necessarily get patients pregnant unless they have good embryos robbins noted all it does is allow us to choose the best embryos to transfer so that we can get the patients pregnant faster he said experts say the couples are not the only people who benefit from these tests the results may help family members who are trying to get pregnant make decisions as well,1
an experimental procedure aimed at repairing spinal cord injuries is showing promise it uses stem cells in the damaged areas in hopes of restoring function and movement and for one patient it is promising on april james mason was an accident waiting to happen there was nothing we could have done to change that night said bob gambuti during an argument james mason s stepfather bob gambuti tried to stop him from getting into a car after mason had been drinking he grabbed onto me i grabbed onto him said gambuti he pulled my leg out and we fell back and his neck broke james mason and his stepfather bob gambuti before the accident cbs news i remember just hitting the ground said mason i remember the whole way with the stretcher gambuti said the most devastating part of the whole process was the first day that they lifted mason out of a bed and nothing moved gambuti said just his head that really hit hard at that point i really wanted to go jump off a bridge mason was left a quadriplegic with just the slightest ability to move his arms doctors said he would never walk again gambuti a retired cop became his full time caregiver and found an experimental trial at new york s mount sinai hospital cbs news spoke with mason just before he underwent delicate neck surgery to try and repair the demaged part of his spinal cord by injecting stem cells james mason cbs news i m just super excited ready to just get it done and go back to rehab and start proving the doctors wrong even more said mason the surgery performed by dr arthur jenkins took four hours researchers have followed mason and five other patients all with the most severe spinal cord injuries cbs news met up with mason again three months after the surgery mason said he was already noticing changes my wrist has gotten a lot stronger i m able to grasp around a lot other things he said james mason after the accident cbs news and after six months he was noticing changes then too i think it s almost doubled with how much i ve gotten better he said and got sensation back into my feet i can feel pressure onto em throughout my legs and they ve noticed that i have a little bit of movement into my hips now today the company sponsoring the trial reported four of the six patients experienced improvement in both motor strength and function dr jenkins who is not affiliated with the company has continued to monitor mason my two cents is it worked that this actually changed his neurological recovery and function dr jenkins said that his actual functional improvement is from the stem cells that were injected what s that like for mason i mean i just have to keep pushing forward he said mason does not blame his stepfather for the accident in fact he is grateful if i had gotten into my car i could have killed someone else someone s mother someone s father someone s child if i would have survived through that i wouldn t have been able to live with myself he said it s odd and it s tough and people say i m sorry don t be sorry i still have him here gambuti said mason believes the stem cells accelerated his recovery but it s hard to know what would have happened without them more research will be needed to try to establish whether they actually repair damage to the spinal cord,1

reviving memory with an electrical current last year in an operating room at the university of toronto a year old woman with alzheimer s disease experienced something she hadn t for years a memory of her year old self playing with her siblings on their family farm in scotland the woman is a patient of dr andres lozano a neurosurgeon who is among a growing number of researchers studying the potential of deep brain stimulation to treat alzheimer s and other forms of dementia if the approach pans out it could provide options for patients with fading cognition and retrieve vanished memories right now deep brain stimulation is used primarily to treat parkinson s disease and tremor for which it s approved by the food and drug administration dbs involves delivering electrical impulses to specific areas of the brain through implanted electrodes the technique is also approved for obsessive compulsive disorder and is being looked at for a number of other brain disorders including depression chronic pain and as in lozano s work dementia in lozano s group published a study in which an obese patient was treated with deep brain stimulation of the hypothalamus though no bigger than a pea the hypothalamus is a crucial bit of brain involved in appetite regulation and other bodily essentials such as temperature control sleep and circadian rhythms it seemed like a reasonable target in trying to suppress excessive hunger to the researcher s surprise following stimulation the patient reported a sensation of deja vu he also perceived feeling years younger and recalled a memory of being in a park with friends including an old girlfriend with increasing voltages his memories became more vivid including remembering their clothes using a dimensional brain mapping technique called standardized low resolution brain electromagnetic tomography or sloreta lozano s group uncovered an explanation for the unexpected findings they found that stimulating the hypothalamus was in turn driving increased brain activity in the hippocampus a key cog in the brain s memory circuitry as alzheimer s progresses not only does the hypothalamus atrophy but electrical communication between neurons in the region also gradually becomes impaired that our memories so entwined with our personalities and senses of self might be so vulnerable to a brown out is existentially speaking rather alarming there s something palpably dehumanizing about reducing our past selves to the exchange of electricity between neurons and also about retrieving memories by hot wiring the brain yet the prospect of the latter is undeniably intriguing given that alzheimer s affects in people over the age of and that current therapies are in many patients dismally ineffective lozano felt all but obligated to dig further his group launched a test in six patients and published the results in the annals of neurology in the study included patients with mild and severe disease who received stimulation in the fornix continuously for year the fornix is like the highway leading into the hippocampus explains lozano it s easier to stimulate than the hippocampus itself and crucial to memory function as expected those with more severe disease continued to mentally deteriorate however it appeared that in those with mild disease cognitive decline slowed with stimulation next lozano launched a randomized trial involving patients from the us and canada all of whom had electrodes implanted in the fornix on both sides of the brain in half the patients the stimulation was turned on right away in the other half the stimulation wasn t turned on for a year though they didn t know it preliminary results published in december in the journal of neurosurgery were mixed but encouraging given that so few people have had electrical stimulation applied to memory circuits perhaps the most significant finding was that both the surgery itself and dbs of the fornix appear safe no serious long term neurological side effects were seen in either patient group supporting future research in the field in terms of efficacy however after one year there were no significant differences in cognition between the groups as measured by two scales commonly used to measure alzheimer s disease symptoms the adas cog and cdr sb alzheimer s tends to progress slowly and reversing or slowing the neurodegeneration associated with condition may take time to become noticeable lozano s final results won t be reported until four years out more intriguing for now were comparisons of glucose utilization glucose is our brains primary fuel the degree to which glucose is burned is a commonly used measure of brain activity patients with alzheimer s typically have reduced glucose activity in their brains as well as again shrinking memory circuits the older patients in lozano s study who had stimulation turned on exhibited markedly increased glucose use in the brain s memory regions not only that the hippocampus of some study patients who received dbs actually increased in size reversing withering hippocampi by encouraging the growth of new neurons is seen as a holy grail in alzheimer s research and lozano s finding is supported by a recent animal study demonstrating that dbs in rats causes the release of growth factors that induce neuronal growth in the hippocampus lozano acknowledges that retrieving childhood memories which he says has occurred in about one third of his patents requires lofty voltages that he would be uncomfortable sending patients home on yet he s encouraged by the early findings that suggest the procedure is safe we also know that in patients who receive stimulation there is an increase in glucose utilization in memory areas of the brain he says a finding that could mean there s a way to overcome some of the damage from alzheimer s evidence supporting dbs in dementia is emerging from other research groups as well a study published in the new england journal of medicine reported that in seven patients receiving dbs to a brain region called the entorhinal cortex spatial memory improved meaning they could more easily remember the locations of newly learned landmarks the entorhinal cortex works in concert with the hippocampus to solidify memories a group at the university of cologne in germany is instead focusing on delivering dbs to a part of the brain called the nucleus basalis of meynert another region in which impaired neuron function is thought to contribute to alzheimer s last year they published a study in molecular psychiatry in which four of six patients either remained cognitively stable or improved in response to dbs as measured by the adas cog like in lozano s study no serious side effects were seen despite the mounting evidence for dbs not everyone is convinced referring to lozano s second clinical study dr nader pouratian a neurosurgeon and dbs researcher at ucla comments the recent deep brain stimulation trial for alzheimer s disease clearly demonstrates the safety of this approach for trying to treat the progression of disease unfortunately the findings suggest that the therapy may not be as robust as initially proposed however he acknowledges lozano s results suggest that dbs to the fornix might be promising for a subgroup of patients those being older people with less severe disease the most promising areas are likely the fornix or the entorhinal area he says but i believe further studies are necessary to better elucidate the efficacy of this treatment before proceeding to a larger scale randomized trial in a episode of the medical television drama house the show s main character dr gregory house survives a bus crash that leaves his memory murky in an attempt to remember the medical history of a fellow collision victim and inspired by lozano s initial paper house voluntarily undergoes deep brain stimulation following the procedure the grouchy tv doctor s memory returns as is customary on the show he cracks the case dbs for treatment of alzheimer s and other dementias is a field in its infancy unlike on tv in all likelihood it won t be widely used anytime soon to retrieve specific memories even though house did this we re not doing it yet cautions lozano yet the fact that the therapy can in some people rescue recollections albeit random ones and possibly induce new neuron growth in memory regions of the brain seems reason enough to pursue it further we re hoping to use electricity to drive activity in areas of the brain involved in memory and cognition says lozano we want to turn these brain networks back on bret stetka is a writer based in new york and an editorial director at medscape his work has appeared in wired scientific american

new york debbie spina is a supervisor for the radiology department at the hospital for joint diseases at the nyu langone medical center in new york city but when cbs news met her this spring she was a patient who was about to undergo same day hip replacement surgery the year old had been having hip pain for the past two years because of arthritis she had heard a lot of positive feedback from people who had undergone hip replacement surgery at her hospital a big attraction for her was the possibility of going home right after the surgery the option to go home the same day and have that family around me was something that i wanted to do said spina she believed she would be able to recuperate more comfortably at home and get back on her feet faster at most hospitals hip replacement patients can expect a one to three night hospital stay total hip replacement surgery is increasingly common with more than procedures done every year in the u s the surgery is meant to restore range of motion and help relieve arthritic pain the procedure consists of removing the patient s worn out ball and socket joint and inserting an artificial socket on the femur side a stem is inserted into the bone and a ball is on the tip of it nyu langone medical center said it became the first academic medical center in new york city to implement a same day hip replacement program in dr roy davidovitch director of nyu langone s hip center said he performs around hip replacements a year and approximately percent of those patients will go home the same day davidovitch said patients are happier going home sooner nothing beats the comfort of your own home for recovery and to be quite honest if the pain is controlled and the patient is healthy and medically completely stable there is no reason for them to be in the hospital it really doesn t make sense debbie spina doing pre hab at nyu langone medical center cbs news there are two common surgical approaches for a total hip replacement anterior which involves entering surgically through the front of the hip and posterior or entering surgically through the side or buttocks according to research done by the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons there are no significant differences between either approach in recovery outcomes six months after surgery davidovitch favors the anterior approach which he believes has a faster and less painful recovery period in the short term because doctors don t have to cut through muscles or tendons to get to the hip like in the posterior approach he does agree that in the long term both procedures have the same outcomes for patients the anterior approach to hip replacement may result in a quicker short term recovery but over the long run patients outcomes are the same cbs news but it s not the surgical approach alone that allows some of his patients to go home the same day it s a combination of what happens before during and after surgery at nyu langone patients have to do what s called pre hab before the surgery they work with an occupational and physical therapist to learn information on the procedure learn exercises to do after the surgery and how to properly move around while they are recovering during the surgery davidovitch uses a short acting spinal anesthetic that lasts about ½ hours and when closing the wound he injects a cocktail of medications to help with the inflammation and pain patients can be up and walking usually within three hours after the surgery but they must have someone around the first night they are spending at home post surgery the people who are against the whole idea for same day discharge for hip replacement are concerned about the very rare instances where somebody could develop a blood clot that goes to the lung or a fracture of some sort said davidovitch the rates of blood clots or pulmonary emboli is exceedingly low and in general if a patient is identified as a high risk or a higher risk we don t send them home the same day dr davidovitch and his surgical team performing a hip replacement nyu langone medical center davidovitch makes it clear that this kind of surgery is not one size fits all patients are screened first to make sure they don t have risk factors like obesity chronic liver disease or cardiac problems those who have risk factors must plan on staying overnight in the hospital not going right home however not every surgeon is embracing the same day trend douglas e padgett m d chief of the joint replacement service at hospital for special surgery in new york is a lot more conservative about who he believes is the optimal patient for going home the same day the number of patients that are going home at this point in time in our institution is somewhere between one and two percent so it s a relatively small percentage of patients that are going directly home said padgett padgett has seen an increase in the number of hip replacement patients and a decrease in their age some are as young as their s and s he said his department performs the most hip replacements of any institution in the u s doing about a year while he is not against patients going home the same day he cautions that total joint replacement is a major procedure and doctors need to be careful to avoid sending patients home too soon while i recognize there is no place like home should there be the need for urgent or medical care the question is will that be available to the patient when they re in the setting of their own home padgett said debbie spina met all the requirements to go home the same day her surgery lasted about an hour which is the average time for her type of procedure after the the operation she was able to move around but felt dizzy and nauseous the occupational and physical therapists waited until evening to try and get her to go up and down steps and walk around which patients must be able to do before they are discharged but spina didn t feel well enough so she actually ended up spending the night even though her same day discharge didn t go as planned spina felt good the following morning and was able to do her exercises and leave the hospital after her recovery is complete she has a few goals she d like to reach i had walked prior to this four miles every morning i d like to do that and i d like to improve my golf game if possible spina said while smiling davidovitch s goal is for patients to return to their normal level of activity as quickly as possible and with many people wanting to maintain active lifestyles well into their s and beyond he expects to see even greater demand for hip replacement surgery and the same day option in general i see this growing to about percent of my practice he said,1

fruits and vegetables are staples in a healthy diet and that includes one aimed at preventing cancer many studies have documented the lower risk of various cancers among people who eat more fresh produce and avoid things like red and processed meat but the majority of those studies have focused on adults and it s becoming clear that many of cancer s drivers start early in life with genes and even with childhood exposures to potential carcinogens to investigate this further maryam farvid a research associate at massachusetts general hospital and a visiting scientist at the harvard t h chan school of public health and her colleagues decided to study how diet during adolescence might affect cancer risk in a study reported in the bmj they plumbed the nurses health study a massive survey of nurses who filled out questionnaires on their diet and were followed for various health outcomes including cancer health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now about half of the women who participated in the nurses health study also answered questions about their typical diet while they were teens those who reported eating nearly three servings of fruit a day on average had a lower risk of developing breast cancer than those who ate half a serving of fruit more with early breast cancer treatment less may be more studies certain fruits seemed to confer the biggest protection against breast cancer apples bananas and grapes were associated with the greatest reduction in risk while kale and oranges in adulthood also contributed to reduced breast cancer risk farvid says that apples bananas and grapes contain fiber which could help to lower cancer risk they are also high in flavonoids which act as antioxidants to combat damage to cells that can trigger abnormal growth kale and oranges are high in vitamin c another antioxidant more mediterranean diet with olive oil linked to lower breast cancer risk this study underscores the importance of what a young girl eats for her future health says farvid this study also has an important message for schools and the need to provide students with the opportunity to consume more fruits and vegetables as part of the school meal program farvid wasn t able to document a strong relationship between vegetables and lower breast cancer risk but says that may be because the study wasn t powered enough to detect an effect the findings are among the first to look at how diet during adolescence can affect health later and highlights the importance of establishing healthy habits from a young age especially since many of the chronic diseases occur over many years and get rooted early in life the results also underscore the importance of eating whole fruit rather than fruit juice in the study farvid and her team could not find any significant relationship between fruit juice and breast cancer risk that may be because fruit s anti cancer effects may have to do with the fiber found in the whole fruit which is stripped out of juice in the latest dietary guidelines for americans however government nutritionists equated servings of whole fruit with fruit juice we recommend whole fruit and not fruit juice says farvid because maybe one of the most important ways that fruit decreases risk of breast cancer is through fiber and even natural fruit juice often has no fiber in it get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now choose your country united states of america afghanistan albania algeria american samoa andorra angola

researchers at mit have developed a two step cream that tightens and protects skin providing a temporary face lift and perhaps offering new ways to deliver drugs melanie gonick mit,1
the skin can last for more than a day one of the first applications said dr barbara a gilchrest a dermatology professor who is part of the research team was on undereye bags a condition that plagues so many middle aged and older people we wanted something that is elegant and the ultimate test is right there on your face she said you really can t see it it s there it looks normal we saw that as a very high bar if you can achieve that you ve done something impressive the researchers emphasize that the second skin is significantly different from a product that living proof tried to market a few years ago as a cosmetic that could correct undereye bags those studies included tests on people with undereye bags and those with dry skin on their legs in one study participants put second skin on their forearms to see how quickly the skin returned to normal after it was pinched in a suction cup a test of elasticity in another study people were randomly assigned to use second skin or a placebo under their eyes trained observers graded the subjects on the appearance of the undereye skin the product s durability was tested in volunteers who wore it while running in heat and working up a sweat while swimming and while going out in a rainstorm one of the important uses the researchers said is in treating eczema and the sort of dry skin that comes with aging with dry itchy patches on the back and legs that keep people up at night scratching we tell people to pat their skin with a damp washcloth and put on a heavy moisturizer but that only lasts a short time dr gilchrest said they end up with greasy goo all over the sheets and they wake up in the middle of the night terribly uncomfortable we need something that was easier to use and didn t make a mess and stays which is what this stuff does another application of the second skin is to keep drugs like cortisone creams on the skin dr anderson said less than percent of what is applied stays there the other percent ends up on your pillowcase or your clothes,1
carbohydrates sound so innocent mere starches sugar and fiber that the body uses for energy yet health conscious americans despise them designing entire diets just to cut them out but out of the pile of cast off carbs there are some you should keep new research around a certain kind of carb called resistant starch suggests that they could be a key way to help control weight when we eat refined carbohydrates like white bread and cookies our bodies absorb them very quickly and the hormone insulin ushers them into our cells eat a lot of them and the body will store most of those calories instead of burning them which is why we gain weight on high carb diets but that s not the case with resistant starches so named because they resist digestion these kinds of carbs bypass the small intestine where most food is digested and head to the large intestine also known as the colon to be metabolized there they re fermented and turned into short chain fatty acids which the body burns as energy resistant starches also serve as powerful prebiotics food for intestinal bacteria in the colon health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now those benefits getting digested slower being converted into fatty acids and sustaining colonies of gut bacteria set resistant starch apart resistant starch is being explored as a healthy food for people with type diabetes eating it improved certain measures of inflammation a condition that often precedes type diabetes and lipid profiles in women with the condition showed one study certain populations and cultures have been benefiting from resistant starches for a long time says paul arciero professor in the health and exercise sciences department of skidmore college in my belief that s what s protected them against some of the ravages of the more modern day high carbohydrate diet luckily resistant starch is found in a range of delicious foods legumes beans whole grains and some seeds have it as do uncooked potatoes and unripe bananas products made from these foods including bean flour potato starch tapioca starch and brown rice flour also count getty images illustration by marisa gertz for time most intriguing and surprising of all is that so many leftovers contain resistant starch when you cook a certain starchy food like white rice pasta or a potato and then cool it in the refrigerator the food develops resistant starches cooking the carbohydrate starch alters the chemical bonds in the food arciero explains stick it in the fridge and as the food cools those bonds reform in a new design the ensuing structure of those bonds during the cooling process is what makes them resistant to then being digested in the small intestine arciero says even if you heat them up again they retain their new resistant starches in all of its forms resistant starch shows promise for helping people control their weight in a nutrition journal study published in october arciero and his team cooked a series of four pancake breakfasts for women the four pancakes were made from ordinary starch starch plus whey protein resistant starch a tapioca based starch

folder arciero and his team monitored the women after each meal for three hours and used a device to see how many calories they burned and what type to arciero s surprise after women ate pancakes containing resistant starch plus protein they experienced an increase in fat burning compared to all of the other kinds of pancakes after you eat a meal that s principally carbohydrate the fact that your body can burn a greater percentage of fat as its energy source is very unusual he says adding protein to the batter also made the women feel fuller they found which hints at a potentially powerful food combo for people trying to control their weight if you can combine a resistant starch with a hardboiled egg or whey protein or pea protein or chicken or greek yogurt that s a pretty powerful combination arciero says it s too soon to tell if resistant starch can help people lose weight but the new evidence suggests that it may help control weight by altering body composition and increasing satiety the potential for a nutritional lifestyle intervention to counter obesity driven by high carbohydrate food though we don t know yet how significantly is fascinating arciero says

an online program may help prevent depression in some people enlarge this image toggle caption win initiative rm getty images win initiative rm getty images working through a self help program online can prevent or delay major depression disorder in people who are vulnerable a study finds similar programs have been used to treat depression but this may be the first one tested to prevent it the researchers say online programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face to face treatment and offer some advantages low cost available at any time and customizable but they re not panaceas in this experiment half of the participants were asked to do six half hour long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem solving therapy which are techniques commonly used for in person therapy in the cognitive behavioral therapy participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again at the next session participants reflect on their experiences for the problem solving therapy people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life they next were asked to categorize problems and worries into manageable and unmanageable the main focus in problem solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable both cognitive behavioral therapy and problem solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior after completing each exercise participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer the trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked the control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it the study which was conducted by researchers from leuphana university in lueneburg germany recruited people with subthreshold depression which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder it was published tuesday in jama the journal of the american medical association of the participants that began the study completed the telephone follow up at the end of months twenty seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with percent in the control group it is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before lead author claudia buntrock a phd candidate in clinical psychology at leuphana says that because the study only tracked participants mental health over the course of months the long term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown it s also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up it took the trainers about minutes to provide feedback for each session and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging buntrock says other experiments with online therapy have found that people didn t continue it if it wasn t guided by an actual human one reason could be that when people are depressed they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things more studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder buntrock wrote in an email still buntrock seems pleased with the results especially since the german insurance company barmer gek that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers i was surprised by the big response to our study buntrock wrote and of course i m surprised about what happens now that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members it s a success story you might dream of when you start but it actually seeing to happen is a great feeling,1
scientists have some great news for those who love coffee tea and wine drinking any of these beverages is associated with a healthier and more diverse community of microbes living in the gut the opposite is true for consuming sugary drinks and whole milk as well as for eating a lot of carbohydrates and indulging in frequent snacks researchers reported this week in the journal science in other words when it comes to the makeup of your gut microbiome you are what you eat and drink in total we found dietary factors that influence diversity said dr alexandra zhernakova a researcher at the university of groningen in the netherlands and the first author of the study in a statement but there is good correlation between diversity and health greater diversity is better advertisement your microbiome is the community of mostly beneficial bacteria fungi and viruses that live on and in your body these microscopic organisms earn their keep by helping you process food and regulating your immune system experts believe that the makeup of a person s microbial community can also play a role in mood disorders obesity and other diseases including irritable bowel syndrome but the study of the microbiome is relatively new and scientists are still working out exactly what a healthy microbiome looks like zhernakova and her colleagues helped fill in that picture by analyzing the microbes inside the guts of more than people they identified factors that were correlated with changes in the makeup of an individual s microbial community these include related to diet associated with diseases linked with drugs and four tied to smoking to our knowledge this is the first study to systematically assess such a broad range of host and environmental factors in relation to gut microbiome and at such a large scale said jingyuan fu a systems geneticist at the university of groningen who worked with zhernakova advertisement the researchers analyzed stool samples of dutch participants in the lifelines deep study the participants collected their own stool samples at home and then immediately put them in the freezer no more than a few days later the samples were transported to labs at the university where they remained frozen until they were processed by researchers this ensured that none of the bacteria had a chance to grow or change from the time the sample was collected also it guaranteed that all samples were treated the same way in situations where samples are sent by post at room temperature the time of the delivery for every sample is different she said that situation can lead to the growth of bacteria during transportation and adds additional noise to the findings after analyzing the samples and comparing them with other data collected in the lifelines deep study the scientists found that consuming fruits vegetables and yogurt positively influenced microbial diversity in the gut so did drinking tea wine coffee and buttermilk on the flip side sugary sodas and savory snacks were associated with lower levels of diversity so was having irritable bowel syndrome and smoking during pregnancy women tend to have more microbial diversity than men and older people have greater microbial diversity than younger people the researchers found the study does not address exactly why certain foods and behaviors influence the mix of microbes that populate a person s gut however the researchers report that people who eat a lot of yogurt and buttermilk had higher levels of the bacteria that are used in the making of those foods in their guts for more complex food such as fruits and vegetables we don t know the answer fu said we can suggest that changes in fiber content and carbohydrate composition are playing a role but this should be studied in detail in respect to every food item advertisement fu also outlined many areas of research that the group hopes to tackle next she said they are hoping to expand the study to participants and follow them over time they also want to collect samples from the nose and throat in a related study researchers combed through thousands of human fecal samples to create a catalog of the microorganisms that colonize the human digestive system they identified species of microorganisms from at least different genera in the guts of close to adults from the u s the united kingdom belgium and the netherlands when they expanded their collection of stool samples to include a small number of people from papua new guinea peru and tanzania the researchers detected a core group of genera of microbes that were just about universally present these genera were common to of the humans sampled and the species within these groups accounted for about of their total gut microbiome the main difference between individual people was the relative abundance of microbes from these core groups including species from the ruminococcaceae family and from the genera bacteroides and prevotella the researchers found several links between the diversity of gut flora and various aspects of biological function for instance people who reported looser stools were more likely to have a rich garden of microflora than those whose stools were harder and dryer the researchers also found significant associations between people s genus abundance and their hip circumference history of taking the antibiotic amoxicillin uric acid concentrations a factor in gout and their preference for eating dark chocolate more than any single factor the use of a wide range of drugs influenced microbiome variation among the people in this study the clearest patterns emerged in those who had a recent history of taking antibiotics osmotic laxatives medications for inflammatory bowel disease benzodiazepines antidepressants antihistamines or hormones used for birth control or to alleviate symptoms of menopause but contrary to some expectations the data did not show that the abundance of microbes in the adult gut was influenced by whether the person was born in a vaginal delivery or by c section nor did researchers find any evidence that those who were breast fed as babies had more diverse microbiomes when they grew up advertisement still both studies underscore that a healthy microbiome is a key component of a healthy body even if scientists are still working to understand exactly how each influences the other the day may come when patients routinely provide doctors with stool samples to help better understand their health fu said it is becoming more and more clear that the gut microbiome serves as a sort of fingerprint that captures all kinds of signals about host health she said do you love science we do follow us deborahnetburn and latmelissahealy and like los angeles times science health on facebook

the growing number of patients who claim marijuana has helped them drop their painkiller habit has intrigued lawmakers and emboldened advocates many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin and as an alternative to painkillers it s a tempting sell in new england hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis but there s a problem there is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions advocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea pointing to a study in the journal of pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis another study published last year in the journal of the american medical association found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments the research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids vicodin oxycontin and related painkillers and heroin though many medical professionals say there s not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it in maine which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana michelle ham said marijuana helped her end a years long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck tired of feeling like a zombie the year old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms then a friend mentioned marijuana which maine had legalized in for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions ham gave it a try in and said the pain is under control and she hasn t gone back on the opioids before i couldn t even function i couldn t get anything done ham said now i actually organize volunteers and we have a donations center to help the needy bolstered by stories like ham s doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in massachusetts and california supporters in maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot authorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses maine saw a percent increase last year and drug related deaths in vermont have jumped percent since vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody i don t think it s a cure for everybody said maine rep diane russell a portland democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana but why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it s working most states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment this month pennsylvania became the th state to legalize medical marijuana sen mike vereb a republican called on lawmakers to take on what he called the number one killer in pennsylvania opioid abuse opioid abuse has no party has no color has no religion vereb said let s face it that s the killer what we re doing today is the healer it s hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis said patricia hymanson a york maine neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state house but if you do too many things too fast you are sometimes left with problems on the other end no place immune to america s opioid epidemic in new hampshire where drug deaths more than doubled last year from levels the senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana there are some promising findings involving rats and one jama study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly percent fewer opioid related overdose deaths than those without but even a co author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option we are in the midst of a serious problem people are dying and as a result we ought to use things that are proven to be effective said dr richard saitz chair of the department of community health sciences at the boston university school of public health cannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative said harvard medical school s dr kevin hill who last year authored the jama study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis but he urged caution if you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain then i do think the evidence does support it he said however i think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction the findings in the journal of pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self reported the data substance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications it would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe they say because it can also be addictive but supporters point to doctors like dr gary witman of canna care docs who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in fall river stoughton and worcester massachusetts since introducing the treatment in september witman said patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids none have relapsed when i see them in a six month follow up they are much more focused witman said they have greater respect they feel better about themselves most importantly i m able to get them back to gainful employment,1

robison is autistic at age the amherst resident was diagnosed with asperger s syndrome a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication although highly competent in fields like electronics sound design and car mechanics robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction for the first time in many years john elder robison entered a sixth floor lab at beth israel deaconess medical center and settled into a chair he was there to demonstrate although not actually repeat a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation or tms in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient s brain tms activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression advertisement beginning in robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen tms sessions as part of a research study conducted at bidmc s berenson allen center for noninvasive brain stimulation the results are chronicled in robison s new book switched on a memoir of brain change and emotional awakening in a moving often harrowing narrative reminiscent of awakenings and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer oliver sacks robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock the welcome ones and the not so welcome after his initial tms session robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known long ago but sensed he had lost he burst into tears the experience was richer and deeper with an added layer of feeling he writes perhaps i was hearing music pure and true without the distorting lens of autism other striking changes in perception and mood soon followed some proved transitory others seemingly more permanent the change in my ability to relate to people is really really big he said during an interview in a hospital conference room advertisement his book is likely to spark even greater interest and funding in tms as a non medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism epilepsy adhd and dementia robison certainly hopes so my world is strikingly different even if the tms energy is all dissipated he said he maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically i feel i hear music with more clarity too whether i think it s there or it really is there it s all the same added robison a physically large man who smiles easily and often to a reporter who first met him a decade ago the changes in his demeanor are obvious more relaxed less guarded more emotionally engaged robison also happens to be a gifted writer his memoir look me in the eye my life with asperger s was a critically acclaimed bestseller he s also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations still for all the positive changes described in switched on robison s fourth book there were negatives he was forced to deal with tms treatments chipped away at what he calls his protective shield of autism he writes leaving him disoriented and depressed at times his second marriage to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression came undone within a year of his initial tms sessions he frequently fell behind schedule at work robison runs a high end car repair business in springfield and lives in amherst old friendships fell apart as robison s public profile rose since look me in the eye he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness it disrupted his life on many levels advertisement robison with research fellow ali jannati keith bedford globe staff at his lowest point in robison considered killing himself gaining and then losing abilities he d never possessed caused a mixture of sadness and wonder robison writes summing up his condition in one word jarred robison has previously written about growing up in western massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family his father taught philosophy his mother wrote poetry plagued by alcoholism and mental illness much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in running with scissors the best selling memoir by robison s brother augusten burroughs switched on revisits that dark and stormy past yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting edge medical technology a techno geek with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems he once worked as a sound engineer and special effects designer for the rock band kiss robison delves into the latest brain research findings and tms s potential to help others like himself he celebrates neurodiversity more generally too a subject he has been teaching at william mary college and harvard medical school during the interview robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his tms sessions and the impact they ve had on his life since then people close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it or even if an improved version of himself would be someone they could love as much advertisement some thought i was crazy to let them do that to my brain but i never had that fear said robison the technology was thoroughly familiar to me and even though i knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong i had confidence that a harvard teaching hospital would use them safely weighing the risk reward balance he continued i wondered what if the sessions could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people i d concluded that one reason i was kind of down was i could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way people would ask can t you tell how happy you made us well no i d say i can t even a percent chance at success seemed worth the odds robison went on and even if as he d been warned any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the minute treatments themselves the negatives these too he has come to accept i was probably naive at the outset he admitted i had this idea that if i could only get these happy messages i would be happier it didn t occur to me that most of the news out there most of the emotion is if not bad at least not all good not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed it was overpowering advertisement robison s tms research team was led by harvard neurologist dr alvaro pascual leone who supplies an introduction to switched on in a separate interview pascual leone says robison s book demonstrates how small changes in brain function however temporary can have a life changing impact imagine pascual leone says someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue an abstract meaningless concept suddenly for a brief period he s able to see the sky in color forever after the idea of blue will no longer be meaningless now translate that concept to emotions he continues if you can give someone like robison an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face then it enables his brain without tms to change the way he approaches life and people nevertheless pascual leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial as robison describes a recent paper by the bidmc team concluded that tms while appealing and worth further study is not yet recommended as an autism treatment rather it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder including depression still there are a number of clinics currently offering tms as an autism treatment a practice that concerns many researchers people are desperate to help their loved ones which i understand pascual leone says will it get more attention because of john s book absolutely but his book does illustrate that the consequences can be long lasting and detrimental robison remains optimistic that as research continues the potential benefits will outweigh the risks i owe a great debt to the harvard team for helping me see i was not broken or defective he said that this painful disability of mine was a rare gift people are scared of the science fiction aspect to this but it s

new research suggests that all women turning should get a breast cancer risk assessment since half of them may have risks that are high enough to warrant annual mammograms right away the finding is important because the latest guidelines on mammograms advise that most women can wait until the age of or to start having annual screenings but the review of female patients between the ages of and found that percent had an above average risk for breast cancer and therefore would be eligible to begin screening mammography at age said lead researcher dr jennifer plichta she s a breast surgery fellow at massachusetts general hospital and brigham and women s hospital in boston how to navigate differing breast cancer screening guidelines the study also found a significant percentage of women would qualify for other breast screening methods including breast mri and genetic testing plichta said we believe formal risk assessment is essential for women ages to in order to identify those who require screening mammography to start at the age of and those who would qualify for screening mris and genetic testing plichta said plichta was to present her team s findings thursday at the american society of breast surgeons annual meeting in dallas findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they ve been published in a peer reviewed journal the analysis was designed to look at new breast cancer screening guidelines from the american cancer society and the american society of breast surgeons the cancer society updated its guidelines in recommending that women could wait until age to start receiving annual mammograms previously the cancer society had recommended yearly screenings starting at age the american society of breast surgeons asbs subsequently changed its guidelines to mirror the new cancer society recommendation plichta said however she noted the asbs added a few extra conditions women should start mammograms earlier than if they have a calculated lifetime risk greater than percent women with a percent or greater lifetime risk of breast cancer also should undergo screening mris women with a percent or greater risk of a breast cancer related genetic mutation should receive genetic testing critical to the development and interpretation of both of these new guidelines is formal risk assessment plichta said furthermore risk assessment is needed not only to determine who qualifies for mammography but also who may require screening mris and or genetic testing the u s preventive services task force recommendations state that most women begin mammography at age however they also say that women should talk to their doctors about risk factors that could lead them to start breast cancer screening earlier the new study involved more than women none had been diagnosed with breast cancer all were seen as new patients at the massachusetts general hospital breast clinic between march and october the researchers said fifty percent of these women met either the acs or the asbs requirements for early mammography plichta said that includes percent who met the acs criteria for above average risk for breast cancer and an additional percent who met the american society of breast surgeons criteria the researchers also found that percent of the women met the groups eligibility standards for regular screening mris and percent would be eligible for genetic testing plichta said breast cancer risk assessments are typically not a part of standard care for this age group the researchers noted since the new guidelines lean heavily on knowing breast cancer risk doctors need to redouble their efforts to make sure risk assessments are done for women in their early s they concluded,1
pregnancy experts including those at the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists recommend that most pregnant women get minutes of exercise a day if that feels a little onerous consider new findings out of baylor college of medicine in houston suggesting that love of physical activity may start in the womb so maybe women who won t exercise for their own sake will do it for the baby the research in question involved mice not women a team led by robert a waterland an assistant professor of pediatrics nutrition and molecular and human genetics selected female mice that enjoyed running according to a press release enjoyed did they smile half of them were put in cages with running wheels during pregnancy the other half had no wheels the mice with running wheels voluntarily ran an average of more than six miles a night decreasing to about two miles late in pregnancy the offspring of those mothers turned out to be about percent more physically active than those born to mothers that hadn t had the exercise wheel option and that difference persisted into mouse adulthood how does this relate to our own species observational studies of active pregnant women and their babies have reported results consistent with ours waterland said but in the human studies it wasn t always clear whether active mothers who have active children simply raised their kids to exercise a lot or whether there might have been a genetic predisposition to physical activity the baylor scientists were able to correct for those variables our study in a mouse model is important because we can take all those effects out of the equation waterland said i think our results offer a very positive message if expectant mothers know that exercise is not only good for them but also may offer lifelong benefits for their babies i think they will be more motivated to get moving,1
walnuts have long been touted as a healthy whole food but new research just upped the homely nut s reputation another notch in a study by researchers from the hospital clinic of barcelona and loma linda university more than older healthy adults were asked to add either a handful of walnuts to their daily diets or to follow their normal diet without eating nuts after one year both groups experienced minimal body weight triglyceride and hdl cholesterol changes but the walnut eaters had significant reductions in ldl cholesterol bad cholesterol compared to the nut free control group the research shows the well known cholesterol lowering effect of eating walnuts works equally well in the elderly even in the long term the authors reported at the experimental biology conference in san diego given walnuts are a high energy food a prevailing concern has been that their long term consumption might be associated with weight gain said study author dr emilio ros director of the lipid clinic endocrinology nutrition service at the hospital clinic of barcelona in a press statement it s encouraging to see that eating walnuts may benefit this particular population other walnut studies presented at the conference funded in part by the california walnut commission suggested the omega fatty acid rich nut may also benefit gut bacteria and help reduce inflammation elisabetta politi nutrition director of the duke diet and fitness center at duke university said we advocate that people eat nuts including walnuts because they are high in healthy fat low in carbohydrates and a good source of protein politi said a serving of walnuts is about halves which adds up to calories they re rich in fiber folic acid and potassium walnuts are especially heart healthy because they have more polyunsaturated fat than almonds cashews peanuts pecans pistachios and macadamia nuts per serving walnut oil can be a good alternative too in dressings and for light basting politi said it s still important to remember portion control especially for people on weight loss programs warned politi try a serving in a snack bag eat walnuts mindfully she said,1
en español by alan mozes healthday reporter monday march healthday news acupuncture can help alleviate the often debilitating hot flashes that afflict many breast cancer patients new italian research says noting that hot flashes are a fact of life for many women with breast cancer the investigators found that pairing lifestyle advice with weekly acupuncture sessions dramatically improved the women s quality of life acupuncture together with enhanced self care for three months is effective in reducing hot flashes in women with breast cancer said study author giorgia razzini a clinical trial project manager in the oncology unit of ospedale di carpi carpi hospital in bologna italy and because hormone treatment for breast cancer typically makes the hot flash experience even worse razzini added acupuncture could be a useful tool for helping such patients stay on their therapy and improve their quality of life razzini and colleagues published their findings online march in the journal of clinical oncology in the study the italian team focused on breast cancer patients who had reported moderate or worse hot flashes while undergoing treatment at five cancer hospitals and one primary health care center in northern italy between and the patients whose average age was were randomly split into two groups one group of patients was offered a three month regimen of self care advice on diet exercise and psychological support the second group of was offered the same advice in the same time frame along with half hour weekly sessions of traditional acupuncture all of the participants kept hot flash diaries at the end of the three month period and for up to six months thereafter daily hot flash experiences were assessed for changing severity and frequency the result by the end of the treatment period those in the acupuncture group were found to have hot flash scores that were percent lower than those in the non acupuncture group the finding continued to hold up for a half year after the acupuncture sessions ended those in the acupuncture group also seemed to have a generally higher overall quality of life in terms of both physical and mental health with no serious side effects the study authors said so why does acupuncture seem to work razzini cited several reasons including acupuncture s ability to prompt blood vessel dilation in the patient s nervous system while stimulating the release of endorphins a neurotransmitter that interacts with brain cells involved in the regulation of pain and emotion it also triggers the release of the stress hormone norepinephrine as well as the mood regulator serotonin razzini didn t know how much american patients might have to pay for such treatment but added compared to other effective treatments such as antidepressants acupuncture should be less expensive and for sure more safe and feasible dr courtney vito a breast oncologic surgeon at the city of hope comprehensive cancer center in duarte calif was pleased that a serious issue in breast cancer treatment is getting a closer look anyone who treats breast cancer struggles with this problem in their practice because the hot flashes that some women experience with anti hormonal treatment can be profound she said almost all women experience them for some it s a moderate situation but for others it s a really significant problem some women i would say probably about percent have such severe hot flashes that they even refuse to take medications that can cut their risk for cancer or cancer recurrence by percent simply because they can t handle the hot flashes vito explained and i ve actually had patients who have had acupuncture with good success so i m not surprised by the finding she added but it is heartening that we now have scientific proof that this can work which in the end may help to encourage insurance companies to their expand coverage so this can become an affordable option for all patients in need more information there s more on cancer and hot flashes at the u s national cancer institute,1

receive proper treatment and minimize the effects of the trauma health newsletter get the latest health and science news plus burning questions and expert tips view sample sign up now but there aren t good ways to distinguish between mild blows that don t require additional care and mild to moderate traumatic brain injury tbi which could have more serious consequences currently ct scans of the brain are the standard way of diagnosing tbi but they can t pick up every case and because the expose patients to radiation doctors are often reluctant to use them on every patient especially young children who come to the emergency room with a head injury more nfl s concussion research full of holes report finds but in a study published in jama neurology scientists report on a promising blood test that could distinguish the more serious cases of tbi that require further evaluation led by dr linda papa director of clinical research and an emergency physician at orlando regional medical center the research team focused on two blood proteins that have already been linked to brain injury papa and her team expanded on that work by studying how levels of these two proteins or biomarkers change immediately after head trauma they collected blood from people coming to the orlando regional medical center which is a level trauma center for trauma related injuries about half them had brain related injuries and half had other traumas including broken bones and chest injuries papa wanted to test several things about the blood test including whether they were specific to brain injuries or whether they changed during any trauma to any part of the body all of the people had their blood drawn times starting at within four hours of their injury and up to days later by tracking changes in the levels of the two proteins over this time papa could see how they changed and correlate that with the people s symptoms more concussion expert over of nfl players have brain disease in all people regardless of the type of injury they had the levels of the proteins called gfap and uch l rose within the first hour after the injuries gfap which is specific to cells known as astrocytes that form a matrix for nerves in the central nervous system which includes the brain and spinal cord peak at hours after the injury and then decline steadily but are still detectable seven days later uch l is released by brain nerves when they re stressed and its levels rise more rapidly immediately after injury and peak at eight hours get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right

other types of trauma suggesting that the two markers can be relatively specific to tbi and not trauma in general more american medical association adopts concussion policy for young athletes we don t want to do any unnecessary procedures on people who don t need them says papa of using ct scans to distinguish people with more serious head injuries from those how just have hit their head but don t experience any symptoms i don t think a blood will be the be all and end all but it would be a beautiful tool for us to have in the clinic to support a lot of our decision making testing for levels of uch l for example might be helpful for emergency medical teams in an ambulance trying to assess whether a patient has any serious head injuries since its levels peak in the hours immediately after a trauma it might also help coaches or athletic trainers are sports events to determine which athletes who have had a concussion are able to return to the game and which if they have higher levels of the blood marker should not more a new blood test to diagnose concussions on the field in the emergency room a blood test for uch l could also help doctors decide which patients should get a ct scan the higher their levels of the protein are the more likely they are to have tbi and would benefit from a scan while those with lower levels probably don t need one and because levels of gfap tend to remain higher for many days papa says it might be useful in cases where patients don t come in immediately after a head injury thinking they re okay but see the doctor several days later because they re concerned even at that point the study shows gfap levels might be higher than normal and therefore might indicate tbi and need for further tests we may not use these blood tests in a hundred percent of cases but probably in eighty percent of cases where there is a question mark a blood test could definitely help she says contact us at,1

cnn how much or how little you eat could influence how long you live the idea of caloric control improving your health and therefore your lifespan is nothing new but researchers are now hoping to accurately determine the type of diet that could make you live longer one team at the university of southern california usc are reducing the calorie count as low as it can go using specific foods to trick the human body into thinking it s fasting a process called fasting mimicry diet can have a remarkable effect on you says valter longo professor of gerontology at usc davis who has been long been researching the mechanisms behind human aging and has recently turned his attention to fasting it can reprogram your body and put it on a path to live longer says longo shutdown and regeneration fasting has been performed by communities and cultures for millennia and longo s team are curious about the advantages their idea follows on from the long running trend of caloric restriction mostly known through diets such as the diet and intermittent fasting longo tested the impact of fasting for five consecutive days every month believing that when the body thinks it s in a state of fasting it shuts down and goes into standby mode as cells are killed and the body goes into standby your stem cells switch on says longo once switched on the stem cells can regenerate the lost cells and organ mass leaving you shiny and new when cells in the body age their ratios change and longo believes the body s reaction and repair methods to fasting help restore them to when you were younger you re killing the bad cells and regenerating with cells that are more functional starvation strategies in a study longo s team set a specific diet for human volunteers which mimicked the effects of fasting over five consecutive days monthly for three months trials were also conducted in mice people consumed approximately calories on day one and calories for the remaining four days but these numbers alone didn t determine the benefit it s not just about reducing calories says longo his diet is designed to include specific percentages of protein fat and carbohydrates for maximum effect the food items used however were specific to the trial and if translated to the public would involve designing meals made up of the right combination of nutrients the human fasting mimicking diet fmd program is a plant based diet program designed to attain fasting like effects while providing micronutrient nourishment vitamins minerals etc and minimize the burden of fasting longo said in the study after three months the benefits were a reduction in body weight as well as certain risk factors for cardiovascular disease there was also an increase in certain stem cells in the body the diet is turning on the body s ability to renew itself says longo the team have since calculated that following the diet every three months could provide enough of an impact as effects are thought to last up to six months how does it work when you fast you lower protein and certain amino acids and you control pathways in the body says longo the pathways he refers to are known as tor pka and igf pathways which when controlled can switch on certain reactions inside the body causing immune cells to die and organs to shrink this activation or reduction of pathways is why the components of the diet such a proteins must also be controlled you won t activate the correct pathways says longo when you make igf less active it reduces risk factors linked to diabetes and cardiovascular disease says miguel toribio mateas chairman of the british association for applied nutrition and nutritional therapy according to toribio mateas the results confirm earlier theories that some hormone like growth factors that are required during development to grow then become promoting agents of aging after development and sexual maturity have been reached he also believes the benefits are down to improved efficiency on a cellular level cells have a list of things to do every day like getting rid of toxins says toribio mateas if their workload is then disrupted by the need to store excess calories certain products can accumulate regulating calories can have a very positive effect he says to him diet underpins longevity is it safe unlike the diet which requires two days of low calories at any point in the week longo s diet involves fasting for five consecutive days which requires much more willpower five days is safe going on for longer is difficult to do outside of a clinic says longo more work needs to be done to fine tune the diet and determine meals that meet the criteria longo has since founded his own nutrition company l nutra to sell products that serve this purpose which may be seen as a conflict of interest he states that profits are going back into funding further research by his team the results of the study are encouraging and warrant more research in this area says toribio mateas,1
cnn a new review of the little pink pill for women with low sexual desire says the drug doesn t work very well but some doctors and patients who ve been using the treatment disagree the drug addyi or flibanserin has been on the market since october the data presented in this review suggests that the meaningful change caused by flibanserin is minimal according to the team of dutch researchers the researchers looked at eight studies on addyi that together included nearly women they said for women using the drug the number of additional satisfying sexual events averaged out to about per month the agency asked sprout pharmaceuticals which makes addyi to do more studies on the interaction between addyi and alcohol the researchers said the drug had significant known side effects such as dizziness sleepiness and nausea the fda approved addyi last august with a black box warning to highlight the risks of severe low blood pressure and fainting when patients drink alcohol take certain drugs or have liver problems i was amazed some doctors and patients who ve been using addyi say the drug has been helpful there are no other fda approved treatments for women suffering from low sexual desire dr lauren streicher medical director of the center for sexual medicine at northwestern memorial hospital in chicago said the results cited in the dutch study are averages and while addyi doesn t work for everyone many of her patients have benefited from it she says she s written addyi prescriptions for about women and three or four have emailed her back to say it s worked they say oh my god this has changed my life things are wonderful streicher said jodi cole a year old stay at home mother from porter oklahoma said before she started taking addyi she didn t want to have sex with her husband matt i love my husband and i believe god created emotional and sexual intimacy as key components of marriage so we had sex usually a couple of times a week and while i was willing part of me dreaded it every time cole wrote in an email to cnn cole said she started taking addyi in november and within six weeks felt a difference i was amazed she wrote i actually enjoyed being intimate and for the first time in a long time felt that connection with matt she said for her it wasn t about increasing the quantity of sex she was having but rather the quality what addyi does is give just enough support so i can think about that part of our relationship with anticipation of pleasure rather than anxiety she wrote she understands addyi can have side effects but said women should be able to choose to take it just as men choose to take viagra despite its side effects i should be able to choose whether the side effects are worth the benefit she wrote the controversy over addyi seldom has one pill raised such controversy among medical professionals doctors who treat women with low libidos tore apart the jama study streicher an associate professor of clinical obstetrics and gynecology at the northwestern university feinberg school of medicine said the study drew erroneous conclusions the international society for the study of women s sexual health went even further calling the study a great disservice to the millions of pre menopausal women suffering from hypoactive sexual desire disorder the doctors had several problems with the study s methodology including that three of the eight studies the dutch researchers analyzed were not published when studies are published they go through a peer review process to assess whether the study methodology is sound one of those studies used a dosage of the drug that was half as high as what the fda approved dr loes jasper one of the authors of the dutch analysis said she and her colleagues removed the results from that study and still found that addyi s affects were minimal she said she and her colleagues included the results of the unpublished studies because sometimes negative studies of a drug don t get published join the conversation see the latest news and share your comments with cnn health on facebook and twitter we included all published and unpublished studies to capture a complete overview of the benefits and risks of flibanserin without bias jaspers wrote in an email to cnn according to the fda which looked at three clinical trials of addyi that included about women about more patients treated with addyi reported meaningful improvements in satisfying sexual events sexual desire or reduced distress compared to women taking a placebo in their editorial woloshine and schwartz said sprout and others put pressure on fda to approve the drug while it is unclear how strongly politics influenced the decision it is clear that the science was weak they wrote we all need a drug approval process that delivers good decisions based on adequate evidence,1
an ibuprofen patch that delivers the painkiller directly through the skin to the site of pain at a consistent dose for up to hours has been developed by uk researchers scientists at the university of warwick and spin off company medherant say their tepi patch could revolutionize the transdermal drug delivery market university of warwick research chemist professor david haddleton told reuters that the polymer matrix in the patch acts as a reservoir for the drug capable of releasing between five and ten times the amount of drugs used in gels and patches currently on the market for periods of six hours hours and even hours what we do is dissolve the active ibuprofen for example into the adhesive so we can have quite a high loading so up to percent of the adhesive will be the ibuprofen said haddleton when that s placed on the skin just like an elastoplast then the drug will actually diffuse across the skin into the body at the site of the pain and then relieve the pain in the same way as current gels and creams we re controlling the dosage and we re keeping it there for a prolonged period of time the patches could help treat conditions like chronic back pain neuralgia and arthritis without the need to take potentially damaging doses of the drug orally the team says that popular ibuprofen gels make it difficult to control dosage and can be easily rubbed off although tepi patch remains highly tacky and adheres well to skin it is not uncomfortable to peel off unlike many traditional plasters according to andrew lee co founder of medherant we ve only been in the lab about months but in the months we ve essentially assessed about percent of the drugs that are currently available as either creams or patches we ve tested them in our polymers with very good results we ve been able to get increased loadings of drugs in the polymer and we ve shown almost across the board that we can get a steady release rate of that drug from the polymer as well the team says tepi patches could go on sale within three years and medherant is working with some large unnamed pharmaceutical companies to get them ready for market haddleton says the technology has exciting potential for other medications such as opioid painkillers what s important is to be able to extend the range of drugs that are available by patches because at the moment we re limited to about different drugs and there are thousands of drugs out there and only about are used in patches at the moment which is limited by the technology of the adhesive essentially he said lee told reuters that many commercial patches do not contain pain relief agents at all and merely sooth the body with a warming effect he said medherant s technology would eliminate most side effects created by oral medication one of the interesting areas that we plan to explore in partnership with large companies is actually using our platform technology to include other drugs that previously maybe haven t been suitable for topical or transdermal delivery or drugs which may have not got through the regulatory filings because for instance they might have caused stomach irritation or other side effects when taken orally said lee the tepi patch incorporates new adhesive technology developed by global adhesive company bostik lee believes ibuprofen strips could be useful for sports participants helping alleviate conditions such as tendonitis and repetitive strain injuries nutrition companies have also shown an interest in adapting medherant s technology for transmitting minerals and vitamins through the skin,1
two groups of scientists presented results at an hiv conference on monday suggesting that a vaginal ring could prevent hiv transmission in women in both studies the ring lowered hiv cases by about though its effectiveness appears to be much better for women who used the ring consistently the ring contains an antiretroviral medication called dapivirine which prevents hiv from making copies of itself in the ring the drug is used as pre exposure prophylaxis or prep slowly leaching out in the vagina and preventing the virus from taking hold in nearby cells one of the new studies published today in the new england journal of medicine tested the ring in more than women in four countries malawi southafrica uganda and zimbabwe over nearly two years at the end of the study the group of volunteers who had used the dapivirine ring had fewer hiv infections than a control group who had a placebo ring with no drug the study found looking by age the researchers saw that the ring did not seem to help women younger than but among women over the age of who used it new hiv cases went down by the other study which has not yet been published but was presented on monday at the conference on retroviruses and opportunistic infections meeting in boston studied women in south africa and uganda like the other study in this one the ring had no visible effect in women younger than whereas new hiv cases dropped by in women over these age differences are probably due in part to how the women used the drug the researchers say much like the contraceptive nuvaring the dapivirine ring should be kept in every day and replaced once a month for maximum effectiveness if used perfectly how much hiv protection could there be we don t know that yet jared baeten professor of global health medicine and epidemiology at the university of washington and lead author on the study told buzzfeed news adherence is also a big issue for the only other prep on the market a once a day pill called truvada initial trials for the pill showed it led to a decrease in hiv infection rates overall but it s now known that when taken properly truvada cuts new cases of hiv by at least because of its high effectiveness the cdc has since recommended that in gay and bisexual men should be prescribed the drug to prevent the spread of hiv the ring adds a new hiv prevention tool which some experts say will be particularly useful in african countries where women are at highest risk for hiv infection more than half of the million people living with hiv worldwide are women and the vast majority live in sub saharan africa a prevention tool like a ring could be used discreetly a woman would have control over it and it could allow her to keep herself safe from hiv without having to ask a male partner to take on prevention strategies baeten said that individual control of prevention is so powerful the dapivirine ring has been in development for more than a decade and the the new studies are the first to show that it prevents hiv transmission still experts caution that the ring should not be a woman s sole source of protection there is absolute reason to celebrate but is a lower number than any of us would like to see mitchell warren executive director of avac a global hiv prevention advocacy group told buzzfeed news we obviously always want higher numbers but in infections were prevented overall and that s huge warren noted that other rings with antiretrovirals are also being developed as well as rings that could offer multipurpose protection against not only hiv but pregnancy like birth control the more types of hiv prevention the better experts say for some women a pill every day might work really well for others that may be not achievable baeten said pills and rings should be sitting next to each other as options,1
ten year old mallory oakes loves to read in fact she has been doing it since before she was years old her mother knew she had a gifted child but those gifts would not come without challenges i think i knew from very early on that she was different but she was my first child so i figured anything that i saw there was a chance that she would grow out of it amy oakes told foxnews com she would wake up in the middle of the night with night terrors at a very young age she stopped napping around months any type of change in our schedule could set off an epic tantrum oakes didn t know it then but her daughter mallory was one of more than percent of american children living with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd she was diagnosed in first grade after there were some difficulties in the classroom amy said but there were other components to it there was oppositional defiant disorder there were some autism spectrum like behaviors and difficulty later on socializing with other children oppositional defiant disorder is one of the most common conditions linked to adhd in children and is characterized by anger tantrums opposition to authority and sometimes aggressive behavior for mallory the disorder led to a pattern of epic meltdowns which left amy reeling and willing to try anything to control them initially i tried a number of different things different kinds of therapies art therapies i took her to somebody who supposedly could heal through touch she said we tried some medication therapies that ended up being really a nightmare for us and making matters worse medication is often the first line of defense in conventional medicine for kids with add and adhd with doctors prescribing everything from stimulants to antipsychotics and even antidepressants to help control the symptoms the spectrum of adhd and related disorders is broad and there is no one size fits all treatment there were times i remember saying to my husband that her behaviors are holding our family hostage because it could be one meltdown a day it could be five meltdowns a day amy said she couldn t do anything to stop it and i really began to realize that her brain wouldn t let her even if she wanted to be good her brain wasn t allowing her to mallory s oppositional behavior reached a fever pitch when the family moved from their home in hoboken n j to the suburb of glen rock n j in she wasn t able to attend mainstream school anymore and the school that we ended up putting her in was an end of the road school in my mind it was not a place where she belonged amy said desperate for a solution amy started searching for success stories about kids like mallory who had been helped by different therapies that s when she found the brain balance achievement center in allendale n j we went in for the assessment and her behaviors at the assessment were really terrible amy said i thought we weren t going to get accepted to the program and they told us they could help us and we never looked back the specialized learning centers of which there are now throughout the country were developed by dr robert melillo a neurology researcher and author of the book disconnected kids to help balance the brains of kids with learning disorders like mallory what thinking really is is really coordinating different networks in the brain so that we can bring all of those networks together at one time melillo told foxnews com and if kids have poor coordination in their body they often have poor coordination in their brain poor coordination between their networks so they can t bring all these networks together to learn in the most optimal way the program uses a combination of sensory motor physical exercises and academic learning to help stimulate and strengthen the parts of the brain responsible for certain disorders if you get a child who has really strong left brain and delayed right brain those are kids that may be labeled with attentional problems or behavioral problems or social issues melillo said the easiest way to get their brain to become coordinated is by making their body coordinated so a large part of what we re doing is this sensory motor interaction building their muscle tone building their strength building their body spatial awareness the program also incorporates what melillo calls bionutritional guidelines to make sure children are getting the proper nutrition for optimal learning parents are a big part of the learning experience and are tasked with at home exercises to do with their kids mallory attended the brain balance achievement center three times a week after school for three months at a time starting in november she has since gone on to complete two more cycles of brain balance learning and no longer takes medication to manage her condition she s playing on the basketball team now she s involved in theatre things that she wasn t able to do because her behaviors prohibited her from doing them amy said i really felt very hopeless before we found brain balance so the fact that i just have hopes for her now is a beautiful thing and i think she can do anything she wants to do for more information visit

cnn jet lag might be the worst part of long distance travel especially when it leaves you feeling tired cranky and off kilter for days but scientists at stanford university say there may be a way to prevent jet lag without medication or adjusting your sleep schedule a team of researchers led by neurobiologist jamie zeitzer is working on a technique that exposes people to short flashes of light while they sleep to help them adjust more quickly to time zone changes current light therapy treatment includes sitting in front of bright lights for hours at a time during the day which allows you to transition your body clock to a new time zone in small steps prior to taking a trip zeitzer s latest study published monday in the journal of clinical investigation could make treatment easier by providing light exposure during sleep before the trip without changing or interrupting your routine exploiting biology in the eye researchers believe the flashing light helps reset the circadian system which regulates rhythms in the human body and establishes normal sleep and wake phases the circadian system is synchronized to the outside world through exposure to light it controls sleep timing hormone release and mood said zeitzer an assistant professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences jet lag occurs when sleeping and waking patterns are not synchronized to circadian rhythms to adapt to a new time zone most people try to get as much light exposure as possible corresponding to their destination either by waking up early before a trip or staying up late when they arrive zeitzer said or they do nothing and suffer the exhausting consequences the body eventually adjusts at a slow pace of about one hour a day taking up to three days to catch up through light therapy the technique zeitzer is experimenting with a person s brain can be tricked into adjusting more quickly to disturbances in sleep cycles by increasing how long he or she is exposed to light prior to traveling to a new time zone the treatment exploits biology in the eye to speed up the brain s adjustment to time changes he said this study builds on previous research published in which found that light therapy works best at night because the body s circadian rhythms are more sensitive to light at night even through closed eyelids in this latest study zeitzer and raymond najjar a former postdoctoral scholar at stanford now at singapore eye research institute found that short flashes of light at night are more effective than continuous light exposure and could speed up the process of adjusting to a different time zone before a trip the previous study was proof of principle can we elicit these kinds of changes and can we do it without interfering with sleep zeitzer said this time around researchers tried to further optimize the process continuous light vs flashes to determine which would provide the fastest method of adjusting sleep cycles researchers recruited participants ages to they put them on a routine sleep wake cycle going to bed and waking up at the same time every day for about two weeks they then had the volunteers sleep in the lab where some were exposed to continuous light for an hour and others were exposed to a sequence of flashes of various frequencies for an hour they found that exposing people to two millisecond flashes of light similar to a camera flash every seconds elicited two hours of change in circadian timing compared with minutes for those exposed to continuous light participants were able to sleep through the flashes of light without waking you get more effectiveness out of flashes of light it will enable us to have more potent countermeasures to jet lag than continuous light which is the current prescribed light therapy treatment zeitzer said the treatment could benefit not only travelers but also overnight shift workers and people with constantly changing schedules he said but that s a long way off there s still more testing to be done before the technique is available to the public,1
michael burk found walking increasingly painful last year crossing the street and tying his shoes became challenges and colleagues noticed he was limping at work on a recent morning mr burk reported to the hospital for joint diseases part of nyu langone medical center in new york city for hip replacement surgery his surgeon had promised him a better quality of life and said both the operation and recovery would be quick about an hour later mr burk was out of surgery by p m that afternoon he was upstairs in a ward walking on crutches down the hall and going up and down a small model staircase at p m he left the hospital and headed home with his wife to northern new jersey where he had a bowl of chicken soup mr burk years old had what nyu langone calls same day hip replacement surgery which practitioners say offers faster recovery times and less postoperative pain with traditional hip surgery patients typically spend days recovering in the hospital and may need additional time in a rehabilitation center hip replacement formally known as total hip arthroplasty is considered one of the most effective surgeries in medicine enabling the vast majority of patients to walk again pain free more than of the operations are performed in the u s a year and include a growing number of patients in their s and s who want to maintain an active lifestyle michael burk talks with his surgeon roy davidovitch at nyu langone s hospital for joint diseases in the morning before his anterior hip replacement photo adam watt nyu langone medical center the procedure replaces an arthritic or damaged hip joint with an artificial joint in the traditional surgical method known as the posterior approach surgeons cut through muscle tendons and tissues in the patient s backside to get to the hip joint the arthritic joint is removed and a prosthetic joint akin to a ball and socket is implanted enabling the patient to move with greater ease roy davidovitch who operated on mr burk is one of a growing number of surgeons offering the same day hip replacement technique dr davidovitch director of nyu langone s hip center uses a so called anterior approach he makes a four inch incision in front of the hip close to the groin before going in to install the new joint the procedure is performed through what he calls a natural interval or opening between muscles thereby avoiding cutting through muscle and tendons as with the posterior approach dr davidovitch has performed about same day hip replacements in the past year there have been no complications and only one hospital readmission for several hours when a patient reacted to the anesthesia he says joel matta an orthopedic surgeon at providence saint john s health center in santa monica calif was an early adopter of the method in the u s and has performed more than anterior hip replacements over the past years dr matta who helped train dr davidovitch designed a special operating table to help surgeons manipulate the patient s legs and body to improve access to the surgical site as many as of member surgeons performing hip replacements in the u s use the anterior method according to a survey by the american association of hip and knee surgeons the technique is considered harder to master partly because the surgeon has less room to maneuver around the joint than with the posterior approach but some surgical experts say there isn t sufficient data to assert the technique is superior to traditional methods mr burk was walking up a small model staircase by p m that afternoon photo ryan jaslow nyu langone medical center jay lieberman president of the american association of hip and knee surgeons says more studies are needed we don t know which is the best approach says dr lieberman who is chairman of orthopedics at the keck school of medicine at the university of southern california in los angeles some doctors question whether it is safe for patients to go home after hip surgery without spending a night being monitored in a hospital we should be careful says vincent pellegrini orthopedics chair at the medical university of south carolina in charleston it is still a big operation some research gives anterior hip replacement procedures a slight edge over the traditional technique is it the cat s meow the answer is somewhat says jose rodriguez vice chairman of orthopedics at lenox hill hospital in new york city a part of northwell health who has published studies comparing the different surgical approaches there is less muscle injury and a patient s early recovery is definitely better says dr rodriguez who favors the anterior method in his own practice although more patients getting anterior surgery are able to perform physical tasks more quickly those receiving traditional surgery catch up after about six weeks at that point there is no difference in how patients fare dr rodriguez says most patients fully recover from hip replacement after about three to six months regardless of surgical approach doctors say by then the bone has largely grown over the implant and it is safely affixed a special surgical table like this one at nyu langone is used for same day hip replacement surgery it lets surgeons position the leg so that they can make an incision from the front a so called anterior approach photo nyu langone anterior hip replacement patients often need less pain medication after surgery practitioners of the technique say although this varies by the individual other surgeons disagree saying pain levels depend on pain management not surgical approach before getting same day hip replacement surgery at nyu in january barbara ross of suffern n y was in near constant severe pain she says the day after the procedure she took one or two vicodins a narcotic painkiller and since then absolutely nothing she says i am better than i have been in years ms ross is back at work running her public relations firm multiple departments had to be on board when nyu launched its same day hip replacement program in including the chairman of orthopedics joseph zuckerman dr zuckerman says he now wants to expand same day hip replacement surgery to other approaches and other joints the hospital has spent nearly over the years on two special operating tables for the surgery dr davidovitch says he needed a shorter lasting anesthesia that would let patients get out of bed and walk the same afternoon mitchell marshall chief of anesthesiology for the hospital for joint diseases says his division was enthusiastic but needed to make sure it could be done safely the outcome a spinal anesthetic that lasts minutes as opposed to the more than three hour anesthesia standard for traditional hip surgery at first there was a lot of anxiety recalls nurse manager ella blot but we would see patients going home and we d say amazing to ms blot a year nursing veteran the world has changed they used to stay here two weeks then days seven days suddenly four days two days after hip replacement surgery keith berend senior partner at joint implant surgeons in new albany ohio prefers the anterior approach it makes perfect sense that cutting no muscles will result in the fastest recovery he says still other partners at the practice use another technique called the lateral approach in which the surgeon approaches the hip joint from the side in all cases patients at the facility go home the same day he says jeffrey leeds years old had same day hip replacement surgery in november he was back at work as a private equity investor within days photo elizabeth leeds the experience of the surgeon the efficiency of the team and the pain management protocols are the most crucial variables that make a same day operation possible dr berend says jeffrey leeds a year old private equity investor in new york city had same day hip surgery at nyu in november he says he was in so much pain before the operation that if he sat on the ground to play with his year old daughter he couldn t stand up pain after the surgery was minimal he says and tylenol was all he needed mr leeds was back at work within days my colleagues were hoping for a slower recovery he jokes write to lucette lagnado at,1
a diet high in fiber may help protect against breast cancer enlarge this image toggle caption morgan mccloy npr morgan mccloy npr if the advice to eat more fiber seems easy to ignore you re not alone most americans don t get the to grams a day that s recommended depending on age and gender but if you re skimping on fiber the health stakes are high especially if you re a teenage girl a study published monday in the journal pediatrics concludes that eating lots of fiber rich foods during high school years may significantly reduce a woman s risk of developing breast cancer the findings are based on a long term study of women who were surveyed about their eating habits in high school the women also completed detailed questionnaires about their dietary habits every four years the researchers found that women who consumed high levels of fiber grams per day on average had a percent lower risk of developing breast cancer before menopause compared with women who ate low levels of fiber grams per day on average for the women on the high fiber diet the lifetime risk of developing breast cancer was also cut by percent of course the idea that high fiber diets can help keep us healthy is not new it s well known that fiber can prevent constipation and keep the bowel moving by making stools bulkier and absorbing water prior studies have shown dietary fiber can protect against colorectal cancer and may lower the risks of diabetes and heart disease there s also a growing body of evidence linking fiber to weight management this new study provides some evidence of yet another potential benefit this is a really important study suggesting that the more fiber you eat during your high school years the lower your risk is in developing breast cancer says kimberly blackwell a breast cancer specialist at the duke cancer center in a commentary accompanying the study in pediatrics blackwell writes there is longstanding evidence that dietary fibers may reduce circulating estrogen levels and this may help explain the reduced risk of breast cancer the authors point to other possible explanations too for instance high fiber diets may reduce the risk of breast cancer by improving insulin sensitivity since fiber can slow down the absorption of sugars and help keep blood sugar levels more stable maryam farvid a fellow at the harvard school of public health who is lead author of the study says the influence of fiber on cancer risk may be time sensitive adolescence is a period when breast cancer risk factors appear to be particularly important she says one limitation of this new study is that it relies on data from women who had to recall what they ate during high school they were in their s and when asked so there could be recall bias the women s memories may be foggy the recollection of dietary habits more than a decade earlier must be questioned writes blackwell on the other hand she says people s dietary habits don t really change a lot in general what you eat as a teenager is really formative as to what you eat later in life so how might the message of this new study linking high fiber diets to a lower risk of breast cancer be communicated to teenagers this is a question kristi king a dietitian at texas children s hospital has thought about a lot she says it can be hard to get the attention of teenagers about healthy eating unfortunately for teenagers they re into instant gratification and they re not necessarily focused on how their actions today will influence their future health she says but she says explaining that dietary choices may influence their risk of breast cancer may grab their attention most teenage girls do know someone that has been affected by breast cancer says king so i feel like that touches a nerve with them given the known benefits of high fiber diets and the growing evidence that fiber may play a role in preventing disease the government s dietary guidelines for americans also say most people need to consume more women are advised to consume grams a day men are advised to consume grams a day so how best to reach these targets add fiber at each meal says king in the form of fruits vegetables whole grains beans nuts or seeds pears are a great bet with grams of fiber apiece and check out fiber rich snacks like popcorn and edamame,1
eating a high fiber diet as a teenager including lots of fruits and vegetables may be another tool to help women lower their risk for later breast cancer a new study looking at diet and health data from more than women found that those who reported consuming the highest amount of fiber during high school about grams a day had a significantly lower risk of breast cancer before menopause compared with those who said they ate less than grams a day the researchers from harvard s t h chan school of public health whose study appears in the journal pediatrics analyzed data from a large ongoing national study of nurses focused on factors that influence women s health the results of this study emphasize the role of an early life high fiber diet on prevention of breast cancer in later life high consumption of foods rich in fiber such as fruits vegetables and whole grains in early life may help to reduce breast cancer incidence lead author maryam farvid a visiting scientist at harvard told cbs news the findings showed that breast cancer risk was to percent lower among women who ate more dietary fiber in their youth depending on how much more they ate eating more fiber during adolescence was linked to a percent lower risk of breast cancer overall and a percent lower risk of breast cancer before menopause farvid said the findings show that each additional grams per day increase in fiber intake during adolescence reduced the risk of breast cancer by percent having the recommended to grams of fiber daily would decrease the risk by percent and potentially even greater with higher fiber intake farvid said women are doing themselves a huge favor in terms of breast cancer prevention if they increase the amount of dietary fiber intake earlier in life rather than later eating more fruits and vegetables was especially beneficial the researchers said healthy high fiber food choices include apples pears raspberries artichokes green peas broccoli split peas lentils beans whole wheat pasta whole grain bread brown rice bran flakes and oatmeal why would these foods have such an impact in an accompanying editorial duke university medical center s dr kimberly blackwell said there s longstanding evidence that dietary fiber may cut down on circulating estrogen levels through changes in the gut microbiome she said that recently more evidence has come to light suggesting a relationship between dietary fiber and breast cancer risk and that eating more fiber would be a simple way to reduce risk one weakness she pointed out in the study is that the women were asked to recall details about their adolescent diet when they were in their s and s nevertheless blackwell said it is reasonable for pediatricians to encourage a high fiber diet and include decreasing breast cancer risk as one of the potential benefits dr stephanie bernik chief of surgical oncology at lenox hill hospital in new york told cbs news it lends support to the fact that we need to encourage people to start healthy habits earlier on dr deanna attai assistant clinical professor of surgery at the david geffen school of medicine at the university of california los angeles said that while it s an observational study not a clinical intervention its larger point about diet and health is important the sexy headline is eat this and you ll have a lower risk of breast cancer but i d shift the focus to eat more fiber because it s better for you and you ll be a healthier person and you re less likely to be obese and have chronic inflammation and other things that will reduce your risk for heart disease and cancer along the way said attai she added the message is a good one as far as increasing fiber but it also has to be put in perspective this is just one mechanism by which we can reduce risk and it does warrant further study,1
thomas e hughes chief executive of zafgen said the boston company will use the data to prepare a risk mitigation plan to help persuade the food and drug administration to lift its so called clinical hold on the late stage trial allowing it to resume but he conceded that zafgen which had once hoped to begin selling its drug candidate beloranib as early as will have to conduct at least one additional study before it can apply for fda approval zafgen inc is set wednesday to release findings of a clinical trial showing many patients taking its experimental obesity treatment lost weight and engaged in less binge eating pointing to a way forward for a drug program halted by regulators last year after the deaths of two patients advertisement we re delighted with the results hughes said in an interview this is the first demonstration of a clinical benefit against two of the major issues that affect this patient population our intention is to provide a plan for moving forward with an emphasis on patient safety the clinical results did not address a key issue for patients and regulators whether beloranib triggered the blood clotting that resulted in two patient deaths last year zafgen has lost more than percent of its stock value since the week in october when the first death was made public many patients suffering from prader willi syndrome the rare condition beloranib treats are prone to blood clotting and other diseases hughes said zafgen will continue to study the effect of the drug in its further trials and risk mitigation plan and address it in discussions with fda officials as of today we have no evidence to suggest that beloranib by itself can cause blood clots hughes said this is a patient population that s at risk for thrombotic clotting issues zafgen said its six month study involving patients suffering from prader willi syndrome met its two primary goals known as end points showing significant weight loss by many patients and a decrease of hyperphagia related behavior meaning excessive eating advertisement while the fda s clinical hold prevented zafgen from completing its trial dennis d kim the company s chief medical officer said it was largely finished sixty eight of the enrolled patients completed the study kim said while other patients completed of the trial s scheduled weeks a small number of other patients withdrew early zafgen has not identified the patients who died or said at which of us trial sites they were taking the drug some analysts have suggested the fda might approve the drug despite the adverse events if zafgen can prove its benefits outweigh its risks to some patients there are currently no treatments for prader willi syndrome the most common genetic cause of life threatening obesity prader willi affects an estimated to americans it can dominate the lives of patients and their families leading to excessive overeating choking and stomach rupture along with slowed metabolism and psychiatric disorders average life expectancy of prader willi syndrome patients is years the efficacy of beloranib looks very promising said dr merlin g butler director of research and genetics at the university of kansas medical center in kansas city kan and a principal investigator for the clinical trial there we ve seen individuals who have lost significant amounts of weight in the six month period we think the drug must at least diminish the food seeking drive which correlates to an increased caloric intake in patients advertisement zafgen founded in is backed by investors that include venture capital firms atlas venture of cambridge and third rock ventures of boston the company raised million in an initial public offering in using the money to finance its clinical studies shares of zafgen which traded as high as on the nasdaq stock exchange last year closed tuesday at down nearly percent for the day robert weisman can be reached at follow him on twitter globerobw,1
autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant could help treat certain form of multiple sclerosis say doctors in sheffield a treatment traditionally used on patients with certain cancers is being tried on a small number of people with multiple sclerosis with remarkable results according to a professor involved in the research the treatment destroys patients faulty immune systems through chemotherapy and then rebuilds them using stem cells previously harvested from their blood doctors at royal hallamshire hospital in sheffield stress that the treatment so far given to about patients over three years is not suitable for everyone with the disease which attacks nerves in the brain and spinal column the hospital is part of an international trial also involving patients in the us sweden and brazil to see whether the treatment can benefit those with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis a form that involves flare ups of symptoms such as loss of vision fatigue muscle problems and difficulties with balance that can last from a few days to a few months these will be followed by periods where symptoms are mild or disappear altogether multiple sclerosis experts call for end to wait and see approach to treatment read more most people with ms there are thought to be more than in the uk are diagnosed with this form and although drugs may help slow progression there is currently no cure consultant hematologist john snowden said the immune system is being reset or rebooted back to a time point before it caused ms the treatment has traditionally been used to treat bone and blood cancers basil sharrack a consultant neurologist at sheffield teaching hospitals nhs foundation trust said the new treatment is showing some remarkable results in the small number of patients we have treated so far it is important to stress however that this treatment is only suitable for patients with relapsing remitting multiple sclerosis disease who have had two or more significant relapses in the past months failed to respond to standard drug treatment and who have had the illness for at least years one patient who has undergone the treatment known as autologous haematopoietic stem cell transplant hsct told the bbc s panorama programme that he had made incredible progress steven storey who was diagnosed with ms in said i went from running marathons to needing hour acute care at one point i couldn t even hold a spoon and feed myself within a few days of the transplant he was able to move his toes and after four months could stand unaided although he still needs a wheelchair it s been incredible storey said i was in a dire place but now i can swim and cycle and i am determined to walk holly drewry was when she was diagnosed with ms and her condition deteriorated after she gave birth to her daughter isla within a couple of months i got worse and worse she said i couldn t dress or wash myself i didn t even have the strength to carry my daughter she had needed a wheelchair before her transplant but after the treatment she walked out of hospital drewry whose ms is described by doctors as dormant said it s been a miracle i got my life and my independence back and the future is bright again in terms of being a mum and doing everything with isla two years after the treatment she has had no relapses and there was no evidence of active disease on her scans paul kirkham another patient who has undergone the treatment at a cost of about said it does knock you out i d rather have done rounds with mike tyson richard burt of northwestern university in chicago who carried out the first hsct for ms in and is coordinating the international trials told the bbc there has been resistance to this in the pharma ceutical and academic world this is not a technology you can patent and we have achieved this without industry backing emma gray the head of clinical trials at the ms society said ongoing research suggests stem cell treatments such as hsct could offer hope and it s clear that in the cases highlighted by panorama they ve had a life changing impact however trials have found that while hsct may be able to stabilise or improve disability in some people with ms it may not be effective for all types of the condition we want people to be aware that hsct is an aggressive treatment that comes with significant risks it needs to be carried out at an accredited centre or as part of a clinical trial the ms society has recently funded a study looking into the impact of hsct on the immune system and we d like to see larger trials in this area they would help us learn more about the safety and long term effectiveness of the treatment and who could benefit from it,1
it s often prescribed for migraines rheumatoid arthritis fever gout and even post operative pain now diclofenac could be a contender to help treat cancer the repurposing drugs in oncology redo project published a clinical study this week in ecancermedicalscience that the affordable generic non steroidal anti inflammatory drug or nsaid has cancer fighting properties while researchers already suspected nsaids can help prevent cancer they re only now beginning to explore the ways that they could actually help treat the disease it s still somewhat surprising that there is still so much we don t understand about how many of the standard drugs we use every day like diclofenac work study author pan pantziarka member of the redo project and the anticancer fund said in a press release but the more we learn the more we can see that these drugs are multi targeted agents with interesting and useful effects on multiple pathways of interest in oncology pantziarka and colleagues report that diclofenac may improve the immune system the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation and the development of blood vessels previous studies have shown that the drug could reduce tumor size in fibrosarcoma colorectal cancer neuroblastoma ovarian cancer and several other cancers according to the press release treating cancer patients with diclofenac after surgery could also be beneficial the authors wrote in the study after all it s metastatic disease that most often kills patients not the original primary disease pantziarka said in the release,1
australian researchers found the greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced the higher the hair cortisol concentrations this article is more than years old this article is more than years old hair samples may help determine the risk of a child developing mental and other chronic illnesses later in their life research led by the university of melbourne has found researchers assessed the level of cortisol in the hair of nine year old children from primary schools across victoria cortisol is known as the stress hormone because it is released in response to acute stress to help the body react and cope the greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced such as divorce injury moving house severe illness or the death of a family member the higher the hair cortisol concentrations were the researchers found parents talk to your kids about mental health even if it s awkward hannah jane parkinson read more it suggests hair cortisol levels may provide a marker of trauma exposure in children and identify those at risk of developing psychosocial and behavioural problems and who may need medical and psychological support leader of the study and a fellow in child and adolescent mental health at the university of melbourne dr julian simmons said childhood is an imperative and sensitive period of development and when things go wrong it can have lifelong consequences not just on mental health but also on general health simmons said what s less commonly understood is that beyond poor mental health it can also be associated with the development of other illnesses such as diabetes obesity and cholesterol issues because cortisol is also central to glucose availability blood pressure and immune function so identifying these children is important while blood or saliva tests could be used to detect cortisol levels these methods were sometimes problematic especially in children simmons said cortisol levels fluctuate during the day meaning results were not always accurate and only revealed cortisol levels at a single point in time the tests could also be unpleasant and invasive for children given blood tests require a needle and saliva tests require the child to fast beforehand however hair samples are not only easier to obtain but provide us with a picture of total cortisol throughout the system across many months rather than just at a point in time simmons said looking at hair tells us new things the research is part of the ongoing murdoch childrens research institute s childhood to adolescence study following a cohort of children in and around melbourne and was published in the journal psychoneuroendocrinology simmons said the results did not mean all children with elevated cortisol levels would go on to develop behavioural problems or mental illness with many other social environmental and genetic factors also involved but it did reveal it was important to further study hormones and the body s endocrine system and how they relate to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression he said we hope this can be used as one of the tools to identify children at risk he said,1

en español monday jan healthday news newer blood pressure drugs are as safe and effective as older medications new research suggests scientists at the nyu langone medical center in new york city said their findings settle a longstanding debate about which of two types blood pressure lowering medications studied are better an analysis of randomized trials involving more than patients examined the effects of newer angiotensin receptor blockers arbs and older angiotensin converting enzyme ace inhibitors although ace inhibitors were developed years earlier both types of drugs showed similar effects in the analysis challenging previous findings that suggest ace inhibitors have greater benefits according to the new analysis published online jan in the mayo clinic proceedings the only difference between the medications is that arbs are more easily tolerated there has been debate for many years over the safety and efficacy of ace inhibitors compared to arbs with many of them using an ace inhibitor first approach with arbs regarded as less effective study author dr sripal bangalore said in a medical center news release we believe that our study ends the debate and gives physicians the option to prescribe either drug for their patients added bangalore an associate professor in the division of cardiology in the department of medicine at nyu langone both arbs and ace inhibitors interfere with the function of a hormone called angiotensin ii which regulates blood pressure but they do this in different ways the study authors said angiotensin ii restricts blood flow through vessels raising blood pressure ace inhibitors prevent the body from making angiotensin ii while arbs prevent the hormone from doing its job by taking its place on the surface of blood vessels the researchers explained previous studies have suggested that older ace inhibitors are more effective than arbs but this latest analysis attributed that difference to changes in the standard of care over the decade between trials of the two types of drugs greater emphasis on quitting smoking and wider use of cholesterol lowering drugs called statins however when trials were conducted at similar times one drug was not more effective than the other the findings showed this is the first time that we have a clear and consistent message from the three buckets of trials of ace inhibitors and arbs all of which show that there is no outcome difference between the two agents except for better tolerability of arbs bangalore said the results of our analysis are especially important for patients given that many arbs are now also generic which reduces their costs he added more information for more about blood pressure drugs visit the american heart association,1
drinking cow s milk produced at night may be a treatment for anxiety and insomnia suggests an animal study in the journal of medicinal food a glass of milk at bedtime has long been touted as a sleep aid but the study found that milk collected at night or night milk had enhanced sedative effects in mice compared with milk produced during the day night milk significantly decreased the rodents physical activity balance and coordination and increased sleep time compared with day milk the research showed mice fed night milk were more inclined to explore open spaces an indication of reduced anxiety that was comparable to the effects from consuming diazepam a drug commonly used to treat anxiety in people the researchers said night milk is rich in tryptophan a sleep inducing compound and melatonin a hormone that regulates the sleep wake cycle the study said researchers in south korea gave lab mice varying doses of dried milk powder made from cow s milk collected during the day or night and mixed with distilled water analysis of the powders showed the night milk contained more tryptophan and nearly times as much melatonin as the day milk two groups of control mice received either injections of diazepam or plain drinking water the mice underwent a series of tests about an hour after treatments mice that got night milk were significantly less active than either the mice fed day milk or water fed controls diazepam treated mice were the least active balance and coordination were measured by the number of falls from a rotating bar during a minute period mice fed night milk on average fell four to five times about twice as often as mice given day milk diazepam treated controls fell about nine times while the water fed controls fell twice caveat the effects of night milk haven t been tested on people with sleep problems and anxiety disorders copyright dow jones company inc all rights reserved cbe d eddac c b cdeb,1

any woman who is struggling with infertility will tell you that one of the worst parts of going through in vitro fertilization ivf are the daily hormone injections and for some women those injections could even be downright dangerous although ivf is still considered the gold standard there s an infertility treatment available that is offering hope in vitro maturation ivm ivm has the potential to improve the chances for women to have babies without a long course of hormones what is ivm ivm is an experimental fertility treatment that collects and matures a woman s eggs in a lab although the treatment is used in conjunction with ivf the initial process isn t the same with ivf a woman must undergo between to nights of ovary stimulating hormone injections before her eggs can be retrieved with ivm women undergo a shorter course between and days of hormones known as a priming phase once the eggs are retrieved they re matured in a laboratory for approximately three days fertilized and then implanted they can also be frozen as eggs or embryos to be implanted later clinics that specialize in ivm require a doctor who has expertise in retrieving small eggs and a lab with embryologists who have the skills to look for them said dr janelle luk medical director of neway fertility in new york city who is ivm helpful for although ivf is considered the standard of care experts say some women may benefit from ivm for starters since there is less time involved with ivm women who are undergoing chemotherapy radiation or plan to have surgery may be good candidates ivm may also help women who have a contraindication to the increased levels of estradiol a form of estrogen which elevates as the follicles develop and mature these would include women with an estrogen sensitive cancer or a history of blood clots ivm can also help women who are adverse to injections or who have failed ivf luk said women with polycystic ovary syndrome pcos or who are at increased risk for ovarian hyperstimulation syndrome ohss which affects between and percent of women who go through ivf may also benefit from ivm ohss can usually be managed on an outpatient basis but severe ohss may lead to blood clots even death said dr shefali shastri a board certified reproductive endocrinologist and ob gyn at reproductive medicine associates of new jersey in somerset and short hills more on this what is icsi infertility treatment what are the limitations of ivm a study in the journal facts views and vision found that ivm achieved up to a percent clinical pregnancy rate in young women which is comparable to ivf yet most studies have found that ivf is superior to ivm although there are different protocols for ivf and there aren t any randomized controlled trials that have compared ivf and ivm side by side studies that look at standard ivf cycles show a significantly higher pregnancy rate than ivm shastri said plus the american society for reproductive medicine asrm committee opinion on ivm states that implantation rates for ivm between and percent are a more reliable indicator of ivm success and are lower than expected for women of the same age who use ivf they also note that the technology hasn t been widely used and that there are no studies looking at the outcomes of birth defects or developmental delays since ivm results in lower fertilization rates protocols that use ivm are more likely to also use intracytoplasmic sperm injection icsi in which one sperm is injected into one egg although icsi is safe and effective the bigger concern is if a patient going through ivm doesn t use icsi shastri said while ivm is cheaper initially because there are fewer hormones to take it may be more costly if several rounds are required although ivm may eventually become more common ivf still remains the standard of care and the most effective way for women to get pregnant with medicine you always want to optimize a patient s outcome shastri said ultimately you want to do the best for the patient so my preference would not be ivm,1
story highlights a new study suggests that people who drink a lot of coffee have lower rates of death researchers suspect that ingredients in coffee could have direct health benefits cnn throughout the ages coffee has been called a virtue and a vice for our health the latest study comes down in favor of virtue it says that drinking coffee whether regular or decaf could reduce the risk of death researchers started with data from surveys of adults in the united states that asked how much coffee they consumed as well as other foods and drinks and then they looked at their rates of death and disease over the following two decades the study was large including more than women and men at first researchers did not see an obvious relationship between coffee consumption and death rates study participants who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had to lower risk of dying than those who drank no coffee those who drank more than three cups a day did not see any benefit the finding was murky like previous studies some of which suggested a benefit and some did not but when the researchers looked at coffee consumption only among people who said they never smoked the relationship became clearer those who drank between less than a cup of coffee and three cups a day had to lower risk of dying than noncoffee drinkers those who drank three to five cups and more than five cups had and lower death rates read more,1

patient bonny hall received chemotherapy for her brain tumor through tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound in a medical first using tiny bubbles and waves of ultrasound canadian doctors have succeeded in delivering chemotherapy deep inside a cancer patient s brain proving that the procedure works in people is a big step forward said dr pejman ghanouni a radiologist at stanford university school of medicine who was not involved in the research it really opens up a lot to the imagination most drugs are blocked from entering the brain by the blood brain barrier which protects against infection but also makes it tricky to treat brain tumors diseases like alzheimer s and mental illness advertisement studies in mice dogs pigs and monkeys have shown that so called focused ultrasound waves can be used to heat tiny bubbles that then mechanically push open gaps in blood vessels allowing drugs to leak out into the brain but the procedure had never been done in people on tuesday dr todd mainprize a neurosurgeon at sunnybrook health sciences centre and the university of toronto announced at a news conference that he had successfully breached the blood brain barrier in a year old canadian woman whose brain tumor diagnosed six years ago had recently begun to grow mainprize performed the two and a half hour procedure last thursday with the patient bonny hall inside an mri scanner hall felt nothing from the seconds long bursts from ultrasound beams aimed at different points around her skull and an mri scan confirmed that the brain barrier was successfully traversed the microscopic bubbles roughly the size of red blood cells had previously been injected into a vein along with a chemotherapy drug called liposomal doxorubicin and a tracing molecule on friday as scheduled hall had brain surgery to remove her tumor no damage from the ultrasound was visible inside her brain mainprize said and she is recovering well from the surgery because the trial was designed solely to determine the safety of focused ultrasound to the brain the patient was not given a therapeutic dose of doxorubicin and the procedure is not expected to help in her recovery mainprize said in the trial at sunnybrook funded by the virginia based focused ultrasound foundation nine others are slated to receive the same procedure canadian doctors have successfully breached the blood brain barrier to deliver chemotherapy to bonny hall whose brain tumor had recently begun to grow sunnybrook doug nicholson media source succeeding in getting drugs across the barrier is a huge achievement said dr nathan mcdannold a radiologist at boston s brigham and women s hospital who has been working to open the barrier with ultrasound since he first accomplished the feat years ago in animals but it s just one of many new safe doses of drugs will need to be determined once medication is not being diverted by the blood brain barrier noted dr gordon li a neurosurgeon at stanford if we feel like we have a safe method of getting drugs in there he said it will open up a whole new slew of clinical trials mainprize said the patient a remarkable woman was chosen to go first because of the status and large size of her tumor because it was an area of the brain that the ultrasound machinery could easily reach and because of her willingness to help the research in a prepared video hall said she just wants to get back to living her life i want to be a normal housewife a normal grandma,1
doctors in training face long stressful hours sleepless nights and a high risk of depression and suicidal thoughts but often are too stoic and time starved to seek help a study suggests online self help behavior therapy could be a solution suicidal thoughts were much less common in new doctors who had four half hour online sessions before starting their first year of training compared with those who got no therapy the research involved about medical interns residents in their first post graduate year which is often one of the most intense periods of doctor training it often involves hour weeks and overnight hospital shifts dealing with multiple medical crises an earlier study of interns found that suicidal thoughts increased almost four fold during the first three months of residency said dr constance guille of the medical university of south carolina in charleston her research group led both studies sarah dalechek a first year psychiatry resident at that university said her program requires two month long rotations of hour overnight shifts in an emergency room she said she became very depressed but had little time to seek help it s very stressful because you re sleep deprived you re not eating right you re working back to back shifts and you re trying to catch up on sleep but you can t dalechek said she was not involved in the study dalechek said she looked into seeing a therapist but would have preferred a web based program since it s confidential and requires no appointment luckily her depression subsided when that rotation ended guille said offering web based therapy routinely to medical residents could be beneficial if her research results are confirmed in a broader study the results were published wednesday in the journal jama psychiatry the study involved interns at yale university and the university of southern california it used a free online program developed at the national institute for mental health research at the australian national university in canberra interns who got the sessions were percent less likely to have suicidal thoughts during that first year compared to those who received four weekly emails with information about depressions and where to seek help the online program included sessions about how to put feelings of stress or despair into perspective for example a poor test grade or bad performance evaluation might lead to feelings of i m not good enough but the lessons encourage more positive thinking about how many exams have you passed to put this failure in a more accurate light guille said the training also encourages seeking out activities or thoughts that bring pleasure especially when feeling down previous research has shown benefits from similar web based therapy in other settings guille said medical students and residents tend to be high achieving perfectionists but that they need to learn you can t always be perfect in medicine you have to figure out how to deal with failure,1
approved by the food and drug administration on tuesday for treating advanced stage melanoma the virus called imlygic which was developed in part in a massachusetts lab is a modified version of the herpes virus that both attacks the cancer and sparks the immune system into action against tumors viruses are usually thought of as agents of disease but for the first time scientists are poised to bring to the us market a virus that can help thwart cancer a development that could herald a new age of viral therapies in clinical trials it has helped some cancer patients achieve remission with few of the nasty side effects common to existing treatments and as the first tumor killing virus to receive the fda s blessing imlygic could accelerate the development of other viral therapies advertisement this is huge for the whole field and for cancer patients said john bell a senior scientist at the ottawa hospital research institute in canada the field is exploding and this would be another arrow in the quiver that oncologists use imlygic is part of a new group of immune stimulating viral therapies that could change how cancer is treated and managed one involves a genetically tweaked poliovirus being tested in patients with brain tumors while another based on a version of the common cold virus is now under evaluation in people with bladder cancer melanoma is a deadly form of skin cancer that kills around people per year in the united states in a trial of patients with the disease percent of participants who received imlygic saw their tumors shrink for at least six months compared with just percent of those who received an older immune boosting drug among those whose cancer had spread locally but not to internal organs the response rate was better percent it s a low toxicity treatment and for the right patients you see quite stunning results said robert coffin a virologist who created imlygic at biovex the woburn based company he founded in the california biotech giant amgen bought biovex and the rights to imlygic known generically as talimogene laherparepvec or t vec in a deal worth up to billion amgen will charge patients for a course of treatment which analysts said is in line with expectations advertisement these days in oncology we ve seen some prices quite a bit higher than that said eric schmidt an analyst with cowen company and amgen s not a company that likes to price gouge schmidt said imlygic s market potential as a standalone drug is very very modest it s being developed in combination with other immunotherapies where we think there s a little more of a commercial opportunity but we still need to see more data imlygic is approved for skin tumors that are inoperable in patients whose cancer has returned following surgery sue bohlin a retired small business owner in farmingdale n j is one of those patients she received the viral therapy in early after conventional treatments failed to eliminate the skin tumors that had spread from her back to her breast the first time i took it i got a really serious case of the chills and a high fever but only for six or eight hours said bohlin now after that there were no side effects such muted side effects point to a major benefit of this new approach doctors and patients said aside from chills and fever the other common symptom cited in the study was skin irritation bohlin s doctors planned to inject each of her tumor sites every two weeks but after several rounds of treatments more tumors appeared in a last ditch effort meant to jump start bohlin s immune system they injected her on consecutive weeks the tumors started shrinking in the following weeks and about three months later they were gone i think we re on the cusp of potentially curing patients with these viruses and other immune therapies said dr howard kaufman chief surgical officer of the rutgers cancer institute of new jersey and a lead researcher on bohlin s trial but short of that this might be like diabetes where we can control it and people live normal lives imlygic is based on a form of the herpes simplex virus that commonly causes cold sores it is genetically altered to replicate only in tumor cells while also producing a protein that activates t cells the search and destroy specialists of the immune system those t cells pick up melanoma cells molecular scent and hunt them down before going off in search of tumor cells hiding elsewhere in the body advertisement this wakes up the immune system and says hey active infection here come check this out said dr antonio chiocca chairman of neurosurgery at brigham and women s hospital in many of the newer experiments researchers are combining cancer killing viruses like imlygic with other immune activating agents known as checkpoint inhibitors these therapies typically open gateways that tumors have used to block immune cells in one small study of advanced melanoma patients treated with both imlygic and a checkpoint inhibitor called yervoy nearly half of the patients responded it s nothing short of dramatic said dr jason chesney an oncologist at the university of louisville who is involved in running a larger follow up study of this combination approach john o donnell a retired math teacher in piscataway n j was one of those who tried the combination therapy but ultimately responded only to imlygic more than years ago a dermatologist told him not to worry about the two tan irregularly shaped spots near his clavicle three years ago however he noticed a small raised area on one of them surgeons removed the melanoma but it returned last year under his arm and in his lung o donnell who is started the combination therapy shortly thereafter then stopped taking yervoy after developing severe diarrhea a common side effect of the treatment but he kept with the imlygic and the lung tumors soon disappeared the nodule under his arm also grew small enough to be removed by surgery through it all o donnell remained healthy enough to achieve one of his primary goals to continue to lead tuesday bingo night at a local senior center without the residents discovering his condition i know it sounds vain but i m too visible and i m too close to them he said they re old and easily upset and i can t look sick earlier this month a new scan revealed shadows that could be signs of melanoma my

here s another reason to snack on dried fruit researchers have announced that people who eat dried plums as part of a regular diet can reduce their risk for developing colon cancer this discovery was made by researchers at texas a m university and the university of north carolina and presented at the experimental biology conference in boston through our research we were able to show that dried plums promote retention of beneficial bacteria throughout the colon and by doing so they may reduce the risk of colon cancer nancy turner study author and professor in the nutrition and food science department of texas a m university said in a press release turner and colleagues examined how dried plums antioxidants neutralized the type of changes that occur when cancerous cells damage the dna they found that when rats were fed a controlled diet of dried plums two major phyla of bacteria in the gut bacteroidetes and frimicutes increased without negatively impacting other areas of the colon they also observed that those who were on the dried plum diet showed reduced numbers of aberrant crypts which are early signs of precancerous lesions considered to be a red flag for future cancer from this study we were able to conclude that dried plums did in fact appear to promote retention of beneficial microbiota and microbial metabolism throughout the colon which was associated with a reduced incidence of precancerous lesions turner said in the release the researchers plan to conduct additional research in humans,0
club drug ketamine gains traction as a treatment for depression enlarge this image stefano bianchetti corbis stefano bianchetti corbis a mind altering drug called ketamine is changing the way some doctors treat depression encouraged by research showing that ketamine can relieve even the worst depression in a matter of hours these doctors are giving the drug to some of their toughest patients and they re doing this even though ketamine lacks approval from the food and drug administration for treating depression it became clear to me that the future of psychiatry was going to include ketamine or derivatives of ketamine says david feifel a professor of psychiatry at the university of california san diego who began administering the drug to patients in ketamine was developed as an anesthetic and received fda approval for this use in decades later it became popular as a psychedelic club drug and in a team from the national institute of mental health published a landmark study showing that a single intravenous dose of ketamine produced robust and rapid antidepressant effects within a couple of hours since then thousands of depressed patients have received off label treatment with ketamine one of those patients is paul who lives in san diego and is a patient of dr feifel we re not using his last name to protect his medical privacy paul s depression began with anxiety i was an extremely anxious child he says i would always make choices based on fear my life was really directed by what was the least fearful thing that i could do as paul grew up his extreme anxiety led to major depression which could leave him unable to get out of bed for days i lived in pain he says paul managed to get through college and a stint in the peace corps but most days were a struggle and paul has spent much of his adult life searching for a treatment that would give him some relief he tried just about every drug used for depression as well as cognitive behavioral therapy acupuncture and even electroconvulsive therapy which induces a brief seizure but nothing worked at least not for very long paul says he was increasingly haunted by this comforting thought of pressing a cold gun against my forehead where i felt the pain the most then one day while investigating depression on the internet paul discovered the research on ketamine it was clear to me that this was real he says ordinarily there would have been no legal way for paul to get ketamine he didn t qualify for most research studies because of his suicidal thoughts and doctors usually won t prescribe a mind altering club drug to someone with a mental illness but the studies of ketamine have produced results so dramatic that some doctors including feifel are bypassing the usual protocols by the time feifel began hearing about ketamine he had become frustrated with existing depression drugs too often he says they just weren t helping his patients enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of david feifel courtesy of david feifel a major study on antidepressant medication published in seemed to confirm his suspicions it found that current antidepressants really aren t much better than a placebo many psychiatrists criticized that study but not feifel i was kind of like i m not surprised he says these really don t seem like powerful tools feifel remembers feeling professionally embarrassed that psychiatrists didn t have something better to offer their depressed patients something like ketamine he knew the drug had risks it could be abused it could produce hallucinations and it didn t have the fda s ok for treating depression but he also knew that doctors had a lot of experience with ketamine it s been used for decades as an anesthetic that can rapidly stop pain without affecting vital functions like breathing and ketamine s safety record is so good that it s often the painkiller of choice for children who arrive in the emergency room with a broken bone so in feifel decided he wanted to offer low doses of the drug to some patients the decision put him at odds with some prominent psychiatrists including tom insel director of the national institute of mental health while the science is promising ketamine is not ready for broad use in the clinic insel wrote in his blog a few months ago there are a lot of pundits who remain skeptical or feel we need to research this ad infinitum before it s ready which doesn t make sense to me feifel says it s hard to take the wait and see approach when you re treating patients who are desperate for help he adds paul was one of those desperate patients when he was referred to feifel in march of the referral was from a local psychiatrist who had run out of ideas feifel says and paul jumped at the chance to try ketamine if there was even a percent chance that this worked it would have been worth it to me he says my life was hanging in the balance and for paul the benefits of ketamine became obvious soon after one of his early injections i remember i was in my bathroom and i literally fell to my knees crying because i had no anxiety i had no depression he says for the past year paul has been getting ketamine every four to six weeks he feels an altered sense of reality for an hour or two after getting the drug the effect on depression and anxiety though lasts more than a month ketamine doesn t always work that well feifel says after treating more than patients he s beginning to understand the drug s limitations one is that its ability to keep depression at bay can fade pretty quickly feifel recalls one patient whose depression would disappear like magic after a dose of ketamine but we could never get it to sustain beyond maybe a day he says also ketamine treatment is expensive because patients need to be monitored so closely feifel charges about for each injection and for an intravenous infusion which takes effect more quickly insurers don t cover the cost because the treatment is still considered experimental even so ketamine clinics are popping up around the country and they have already treated thousands of patients willing and able to pay out of pocket some of the clinics are run by psychiatrists others have been started by entrepreneurial anesthesiologists and emergency room doctors who are familiar with ketamine but may not know much about depression we ve seen ketamine clinics open up as pure business models feifel says i m a little bit concerned about that feifel fears something bad will happen to a depressed patient at one of these clinics and that could set back efforts to make the drug more widely available,1

correction appended sept in what the authors describe as the largest and longest study of resveratrol in people with mild to moderate alzheimer s disease there s encouraging news that the component which is found in red wine grapes and dark chocolate may keep the disease from progressing dr r scott turner professor of neurology and director of the memory disorders program at georgetown university medical center and his team created a purified form of resveratrol which is being studied in both animal and human studies for preventing age related conditions such as diabetes and cancer in a study published in neurology he described how they randomly assigned half of a group of men and women to take up to mg of resveratrol daily and the other half to a placebo for a year all of the participants had mild or moderate alzheimer s disease at the end of the year turner compared the people s scores on cognitive tests and assessments of how independent they were in their daily living from the start of the study my nightmare was that nothing would be different from the placebo group and there would be nothing of interest to talk about he says but that did not happen i think resveratrol is an engaging target that s very interesting and could be pharmacologically manipulated to develop a treatment more red wine not that healthy after all study shows the resveratrol group showed no change in the levels of a protein that builds up in the brains of alzheimer s patients turner s group also measured the protein in spinal fluid and blood and did not see differences over the year in the resveratrol group that s likely because experts believe that as alzheimer s progresses more of the protein plaques form in the brain and less of the protein is released to the rest of the body the resveratrol group also showed smaller brain volume which in the case of alzheimer s is a positive sign as the disease can cause inflammation and swelling that can interfere with nerve connections more noteworthy advances in alzheimer s research even more encouraging the people who were treated showed slight improvements in their ability to maintain certain daily activities on their own such dressing and bathing themselves how resveratrol may be affecting the alzheimer s disease process isn t clear yet turner says the findings don t suggest that red wine is a cure for alzheimer s the amounts of resveratrol in the purified doses that the participants took were extremely high and beyond those found on the market currently around what would be contained in about bottles of red wine plus he says resveratrol supplements currently available over the counter are unregulated and we don t know how much is in it we need more studies to see if it really does have benefit and then it could be turned into more effective drugs that can better target alzheimer s horrible habits you need to stop right now chris pecoraro getty images sam edwards getty images caiaimage jetta productions getty images by nacoki media arc getty images flickr rf reza estakhrian getty images of advertisement correction the original version of this story misstated that all the participants were men the study included men and women contact us at,1
reuters health many women with severe menopausal symptoms are not being treated for them even though safe effective remedies are available a study from australia suggests a woman photographs roses at regent s park in london july reuters neil hall the findings may be applicable to other countries too according to senior author dr susan r davis from monash university in melbourne from my interactions with colleagues from across the globe i do not believe that what we have observed is australian specific she told reuters health by email the management of menopause has been relatively similar in the uk the usa and in australia up to half of women in menopause experience so called vasomotor symptoms such as hot flashes and night sweats hormone replacement therapy hrt which generally combines estrogen plus progestin is very effective but after the initial findings of the women s health initiative study showed that hrt can increase the risk of breast cancer stroke and other serious problems many women stopped using it as reported in the journal menopause in and davis and her team analyzed survey responses from nearly women ages to seventeen percent were having moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms and percent reported moderate to severe sexual symptoms but most were not receiving any kind of treatment only percent reported use of hrt and less than percent were using any type of therapy that didn t involve hormones the women who did use hormones were mostly taking pills containing estrogen rather than preparations that are absorbed into the skin and that are potentially safer the researchers found extrapolating our findings to million australian women aged to years we found that women are likely to have moderate to severe vasomotor symptoms with most women remaining untreated they write in addition very few women were receiving vaginal estrogen therapy for sexual symptoms vaginal dryness is common with menopause and affects sexual functioning vaginal estrogen preparations are very safe and effective for this problem but were prescribed to less than percent of the women the authors say why are so few women being treated overall there is the uncertainty of women and of doctors as to what the options are what is and is not safe and of the safe options what and how to prescribe them davis said there is also she said a complete lack of understanding that for most women these symptoms are not fleeting it isn t grin and bear it for a few months and it will all pass as many women suffer severe symptoms for five plus years she said women and doctors simply are not aware that symptoms can last this long finally many women don t realize that non hormonal options can be safe and effective she added dr wulf h utian medical director of the north american menopause society agrees that many reasons may underlie the lack of treatment it is partly fall out from the controversy over hormone therapy he told reuters health in an email but overall he said it is a combination of patients not wanting therapy or not having information about it and also the provider not prescribing it source bit ly howooq menopause online july,1

en español by emily willingham healthday reporter tuesday aug healthday news needles beat pills for treating hot flashes in breast cancer survivors according to a new trial that compared acupuncture sham acupuncture the medication gabapentin and a placebo pill interestingly sham acupuncture came in second place for effectiveness the researchers said furthermore the effects of acupuncture were significant and enduring for hot flashes while gabapentin s effect only happened when a patient was taking the medication said study first author dr jun mao an associate professor of family medicine and community health at the university of pennsylvania in philadelphia the study was published aug in the journal of clinical oncology mao and his colleagues tested the treatments in women who were breast cancer survivors the women were enduring hot flashes at least twice a day thirty women each received real acupuncture that also included a bit of an electric buzz or the inactive placebo pill women got sham acupuncture and women received gabapentin neurontin the drug is typically used to treat seizures and nerve pain the women documented their hot flashes in diaries noting frequency and severity for weeks of treatment and then continued to keep track of their hot flashes up to weeks total the investigators used a hot flash score to see how much frequency and severity changed from when the study started to what the women reported at and weeks acupuncture had the greatest effect on overall hot flash scores at weeks when all interventions ended followed by sham acupuncture and then gabapentin at weeks weeks after treatments ended acupuncture was still associated with the greatest reduction in hot flashes but even those who had sham acupuncture or placebo pills had steeper drops in hot flash scores at weeks than those who took gabapentin the placebo effects for both acupuncture and drugs are quite intriguing as they both seem to persist over time mao said the magnitude of the placebo effect for acupuncture is bigger than for the drug the results with the sham acupuncture which bested gabapentin suggest that there is more than a placebo effect with the sham acupuncture said dr gary deng interim chief of the integrative medicine service at memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york city there is a component of behavior of doing a sham procedure so it psychologically may trigger a different kind of reaction from patients versus taking the placebo pill deng pointed out that clinicians have come to realize that the placebo effect is very important in treatment in fact in clinical practice every doctor uses it all of the time he said the so called bedside manner or communication with patients all of these enhance the effect of the patients feeling they re getting something no one is quite sure why placebos work for some people and not for others said deng it s like psychotherapy he added why does it work for some people and not others he suggested that differences in anatomy and genetics might be possible explanations but said there is a fertile field for further research some patients might wonder if acupuncture that s helpful for hot flashes among breast cancer patients might be helpful for the hot flashes associated with natural menopause but mao pointed out that hot flashes in breast cancer patients are more common more severe and longer lasting than menopausal hot flashes however deng said that both might have similar causes related to lower estrogen levels breast cancer survivors have hot flashes because of hormonal repression he said menopause also is linked to declining estrogen levels one big distinction between the two populations though is that breast cancer survivors do not have the option of hormone replacement therapy open to them because those hormones are linked to breast cancer some women undergoing natural menopause still might have that option available for this reason most studies of acupuncture for hot flashes have focused on breast cancer survivors deng explained but should a woman undergoing natural menopause try acupuncture for hot flashes for patients suffering symptoms they can look for all kinds of possible solutions and are better off talking to their doctor to find out what s most appropriate for them deng said more information visit the u s national center for complementary and integrative health for more on acupuncture,1

play this video game and call me in the morning enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of akili courtesy of akili i m driving through a frozen world where the roads are paved in ice as i swerve left to avoid a miniature iceberg a red fish flashes at the top of my screen i m supposed to tap all the red fish that pop up but not the green fish or the blue and i have to do this without crashing the car an unidentifiable omnipresent game meister says doing one thing at a time is easy but doing them both at the same time is where the magic happens as i get better at the game my brain is being trained to ignore distractions and stay focused or at least that s the hypothesis of the neuroscientists who designed it the brain networks that control multitasking overlap with networks that control working memory and attention span so some scientists believe that by playing this game project evo you can improve a range of cognitive skills and by extension relieve a range of symptoms associated with cognitive disorders we ve been through eight or nine completed clinical trials in all cognitive disorders adhd autism depression says matt omernick executive creative director at akili the northern california startup that s developing the game omernick worked at lucas arts for years making star wars games where players attack their enemies with light sabers now he s working on project evo it s a total switch in mission from dreaming up best sellers for the commercial market to designing games to treat mental health conditions the qualities of a good video game things that hook you what makes the brain snap engage and go could be a perfect vessel for actually delivering medicine he says in fact the creators believe their game will be so effective it might one day reduce or replace the drugs kids take for adhd but this kind of goal requires a totally different business model before they can deliver their game to players they first have to go through the food and drug administration the fda the first time those three letters were uttered in a group setting everyone s like oooo that s scary do we want to do that omernick recalls silicon valley companies routinely avoid government regulation if at all possible the process for fda approval can be slow and expensive if it says fda approval needed in the business plan i myself scream in fear and run away says tim chang managing director at mayfield fund a venture capital firm he has never backed a company that wanted to go through the fda most startups can bring a new video game to market in six months going through the fda approval process for medical devices could take three or four years and cost millions of dollars enlarge this image toggle caption courtesy of akili courtesy of akili that s what s been scary about going the regulatory path chang says you re waiting and waiting and waiting for fda approval going through all these different clinical tests and you could run out of money easily before you get through that the worst fear is that the technology will become outdated by the time the fda process is complete tech companies are constantly redesigning their software to keep up with competition and consumer habits chang says in four years a game could be obsolete it s really out of sync with the way we think of product iteration he says we re more on the order of days and real time changes where you re pushing out app updates every week on the other hand chang admits that going the regulatory route could really pay off if the fda gives its stamp of approval doctors could prescribe the game and that opens the door for insurance companies to pay for it then you re going into the land of the big big budgets chang says within in the health care field some executives believe the commercial successes of online games like angry birds and candy crush could translate into the medical world they see the potential of these games to not only make money but to save money too when you look at the percentage of individuals that are playing video games percent and overlay that with the percentage of individuals that have chronic conditions or need some assistance from the medical perspective percent the relationship is pretty strong says willis gee director of information technology strategy and innovation at health insurer cigna on one level it s about competition the affordable care act has made it a lot easier for people to switch health plans cigna has to find ways to stand out people want to do things that are fun says gee so we have to be there with them it might seem like a strange vision for an industry known best for issuing denial letters but gee believes reimbursing patients to play games could cut other health costs by promoting exercise and preventing disease for example or even reducing the amount of expensive drugs people take as an industry we re going to have to reorient ourselves around what it is we re really trying to do he says and if at the end of the day the goal is about improving health then we may need to revisit the way we are quantifying outcomes drug companies are keeping an eye on these games too pfizer partnered with the project evo team to see if the game could help improve the diagnosis of alzheimer s disease the drug manufacturer believes it could alleviate some of the problems with drug trials helping to make them faster cheaper and more efficient right now screening for alzheimer s is subjective patients and families fill out forms on mood and attention the results are often inaccurate some of the people recruited for drug trials end up not having alzheimer s at all dr michael ehlers pfizer s chief scientific officer for neuroscience says project evo could help them identify better candidates more quickly i d like to think we could cut down standard clinical trials in size and length of time by half or more he says in terms of the game replacing drugs someday though ehlers isn t so sure he has a different analogy it s just essentially a digital version of otherwise typical kinds of psychological and cognitive behavioral therapy he says but ehlers still thinks game designers should go through the same fda tests and trials as drug manufacturers quite important is that we hold them to the same standard of evidence that they actually work he says here ehlers touches on a broader controversy around games like project evo there are several scientists who say this field is so new that it s lacking in good evidence that brain changes actually occur randall engle of the georgia institute of technology believes giving the game fda approval could hinder good science because it s a proprietary thing at that point and that s a problem if it becomes proprietary the only people who can do unfettered research on it are the people who own the procedure he says but then again that s exactly how it works with drugs,1
correction an earlier version of this article misspelled the name of the person who designed the mmse test this version has been corrected a small company started by a neuroscientist at the university of rochester has moved closer to providing doctors with what he says is a simple computer based tool to help detect early signs of alzheimer s disease or other forms of dementia cerebral assessment systems has received marketing approval from the u s food and drug administration for cognivue a cognitive assessment tool that functions somewhat like a video game a patient can perform the inexpensive and simple test while a time strapped primary care physician tends to other patients the minute non invasive examination can detect subtle lapses in the brain s perceptual ability that may signal the early stages of mental decline caused by dementia the federal government s approval to market the device comes as alzheimer s researchers everywhere step up the pursuit for easier and more inexpensive ways to identify dementia in its earliest stages scientists are cautiously optimistic about progress toward finding treatments for alzheimer s disease look there is a late life tsunami of late life cognitive decline coming at us and health care providers are standing on the beach said charles j duffy a neurology professor at the university of rochester medical center who founded the company what we are all about is making cognitive care part of primary care more than million americans have alzheimer s disease the leading cause of dementia that number is expected to reach million by according to the alzheimer s association with the united states shifting toward an older society the hope is that earlier detection can lead to earlier intervention to slow or arrest the disease perhaps through medications working their way to the market or changes in lifestyle in addition to alzheimer s a person s mental competency can be hindered by other conditions such as untreated diabetes thyroid conditions or toxic interactions among prescription medications duffy said his tool holds promise as a relatively inexpensive and easy way to test people s memory and ability to think with cognivue patients sit before a video screen that shows a series of images such as a group of dots that move around and fluctuate in clarity using a rotary shaped mouse called a manipulandum the patients try to follow the dots with a wedge shaped cursor the task becomes more difficult especially for people with early stages of dementia as the dots move around changing their direction speed and intensity all perception is interpretive and so what we re doing is measuring that process duffy said other parts of the test challenge memory recall or the ability to recognize letters and shapes cerebral assessment systems device received de novo approval from the fda a streamlined process for reviewing medical devices that appear to be new enough to have no equivalent and pose little risk the pittsford n y based company s fda application included data from a comparative study involving people recruited from communities for older adults the subjects ranging in age from to were classified in three groups based on cognitive abilities normal mild cognitive impairment and impaired their performance on the cognivue device was compared to their scores on an existing cognitive assessment test known as the st louis university mental status examination slums the device would be available only for use by medical professionals as part of a more comprehensive assessment of cognitive function it is not intended to be a standalone diagnostic tool and its effectiveness for people with less than years of education is not proven linda m rice a primary care internist with about patients in her rochester practice said that after a year of using the device in her clinic she is convinced of its worth about half of her patients are older than and they often have questions about memory loss and their cognitive abilities but her options for rating their performance involve administering the mini mental state exam mmse also known as the folstein test that uses a point questionnaire the test which has been around since offers only a broad indication of cognitive abilities and fails to pick up borderline problems she said you have to be pretty bad to do poorly on this exam she said but the alternative involves referring patients for a battery of neuropsychiatric tests that can take hours to complete and cost or more the computer based tool created by duffy has helped rice to convince some patients that it s time to stop driving and to start them on medications sooner to slow the progress of alzheimer s i think it s a really potentially valuable tool said leslie algase an internist who tends about patients in rochester at least percent of whom are older than algase who said she has no financial ties to the company agreed to use the cognivue in her practice about three years ago after meeting duffy at a conference algase rates the device as about as accurate as the mmse but she said it s more convenient and less time consuming to administer,1
previous research on communication in couples affected by alzheimer s has tended to focus on deficits said study author christine williams professor and director of the phd in nursing program at florida atlantic university s christine e lynn college of nursing identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage as alzheimer s disease progresses cognitive impairment can take an ever greater toll on communication and relationships a new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by alzheimer s maintain a sense of connection which could improve quality of life for both partners advertisement no one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right what is helping said williams whose findings were published in the international journal for human caring some past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse with alzheimer s can follow a relationship is obviously so much more than that members of williams s research team visited couples in their home once a week for weeks the couples who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses were receiving coaching in communication with caregivers learning to listen to avoid arguing to not treat their spouse like a child twice during the weeks the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room a total of thirty minute conversations were recorded in analyzing the recordings williams identified communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection these patterns showed the caregivers applying what they d learned through coaching in creative ways she said they included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day to day events waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words and finding alternate ways to communicate for example singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed advertisement the caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations they were willing to listen to stories they had heard before and resisted correcting their partners versions of past events this showed that they value the relationship more than being right williams said some of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations the paper noted yet williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by alzheimer s previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers and most say they need education about communication the reality is a person with dementia isn t going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten williams said at the same time people with alzheimer s do have moments of clarity or show affection when it s unexpected these are moments that caregivers can cherish ami albernaz can be reached at,1
researchers from the university of pittsburgh medical center and rutgers university studied males from adolescence to their mid s the participants fell into four groups those with no use or low use of marijuana early chronic users those who only smoked during their teens and those who began using it later and continued using the drug the early chronic users smoked a great deal a peak of more than days per year on average when they were years old ad ad the researchers found no links to physical or mental health issues including depression psychotic symptoms or asthma in any group even those with very high use they controlled for cigarette smoking other drug use access to health insurance and other factors what we found was a little surprising lead author jordan bechtold a research fellow at the university of pittsburgh medical center said in a statement based on other studies in the past that seemed to allude to marijuana use and later development of psychotic symptoms such as delusions or hallucinations the researchers had thought they might find some associations to disease or other health conditions but there were none ad they also found no link to a wide range of other health issues cancer asthma respiratory problems depression anxiety allergies headaches or high blood pressure ad bechtold said the researchers wanted to help inform the debate about legalization of marijuana but that this is a very complicated issue and one study including his own should not be taken in isolation and should be viewed in context of other studies on teenagers marijuana use one major limitation of the study is that it ends when the men are in their s which may be too early for decrements in health to emerge the authors acknowledge therefore continued data collection and longer follow ups are needed ad update the study s findings generated significant controversy along with requests for supplemental analysis according to the editors of the psychology of addictive behaviors in a lengthy clarification issued in december the journal said that by applying different models to look at the data they confirmed that there did not appear to be any link between marijuana use and health issues however the reanalysis regarding psychotic disorders contradicted the earlier conclusions that there indeed appeared to be a higher risk of psychotic disorders among marijuana users in the study versus non users that approached statistical significance when using a more liberal test read more ad,0
london reuters a brain training ipad game developed in britain may improve the memory of patients with schizophrenia helping them in their daily lives at home and at work researchers said on monday scientists at cambridge university said tests on a small number of patients who played the game over four weeks found they had improvements in memory and learning the game wizard is designed to help so called episodic memory the type of memory needed to remember where you left your keys several hours ago or to remember a few hours later where you parked your car in a multi storey car park schizophrenia is a long term mental health condition that causes a range of psychological symptoms ranging from changes in behavior through to hallucinations and delusions while some psychotic symptoms can be reasonably well treated with medication patients often still have debilitating problems with memory and cognitive function meaning they struggle to get back to work or stay in education there is increasing evidence that computer assisted training can help people with schizophrenia overcome some of their symptoms with better outcomes in their daily lives this study published in the journal philosophical transactions of the royal society b found that patients who played the memory game made significantly fewer errors and needed significantly fewer attempts to remember the location of different patterns specific tests they also improved their scores on the global assessment of functioning gaf scale which doctors use to rate the social occupational and psychological functioning of adults importantly the patients also said they enjoyed the game and were motivated to play it across the eight hours of cognitive training the researchers said this was important since lack of motivation is a common feature of schizophrenia we need a way of treating the cognitive symptoms of schizophrenia such as problems with episodic memory but slow progress is being made toward developing a drug treatment said barbara sahakian from the department of psychiatry at cambridge university this proof of concept study demonstrates that the memory game can help where drugs have so far failed and because the game is interesting even those patients with a general lack of motivation are spurred on to continue the training,0
the study reported that taking aromatase inhibitors for years reduced the risk of postmenopausal women with breast cancer dying of their disease by percent within years of starting treatment compared with no hormonal treatment ad ad the results were part of the early breast cancer trialists collaborative group a collaboration based at the university of oxford that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years paul workman professor and chief executive of the institute of cancer research in london said in a statement accompanying the publication of the journal article that the evidence on aromatase inhibitors has been accumulating for well over a decade but it has taken this huge and complex study to make sense of all the data and provide a firm basis for clinical guidelines ad it tends to be the discovery of new treatments that grabs the headlines but it is just as important to maximize the benefit patients get from existing treatments through major practice changing studies like this workman said ad the researchers wrote in the study that a substantial number of the trial participants switched from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors after they heard that it could reduce recurrence which affected their results if this had not happened the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater they surmised a separate analysis by the same group also published in the lancet looked at bisphosphonates which are typically used for osteoporosis researchers at sheffield university found that in postmenopausal women during the first years after diagnosis of breast cancer the drug could reduce the risk of death by per cent ad using the two drugs together as a one two punch may be even more powerful richard gray a professor at the university of oxford and who served as the lead statistician for both studies said that half of all women with breast cancer are postmenopausal with hormone sensitive tumors and could potentially benefit from both drugs ad the drugs are complementary because the main side effect of aromatase inhibitors is an increase in bone loss and fractures while bisphosphonates reduce bone loss and fractures as well as improving survival he said read more ad,1
a scourge we can eliminate if we choose wisely the human papillomavirus photo by the laboratory of tumor virus biology through an article in forbes i saw that a new study has been published about the safety of gardasil a vaccine for prevention of certain strains of human papillomavirus or hpv hpv is a virus that can lead to genital warts many types of cancer and cervical cancer in women which kills women every year in the u s alone the gardasil vaccine on the other hand caused some people to faint after getting it and others got mild skin infections both of which occur somewhat rarely with other vaccines too as you might expect which sounds worse to you the study published in the pediatric infectious disease journal looked at the published data about effects from the vaccine and found that it has a favorable safety profile this study comes after many other previous studies that show essentially the same thing there is no correlation between getting the gardasil vaccine and seriously adverse effects such as autoimmune diseases including guillain barre syndrome and multiple sclerosis anaphylaxis venous thromboembolism and stroke mind you all these things and more have been used by people who attack vaccines as an argument against it and just like essentially every claim made by the anti vaccination movement these arguments are wrong that doesn t stop them from making them or from them getting attention by mainstream media attention they most assuredly do not deserve it s very frustrating mounds of data show these vaccinations are incredibly low risk but it only takes a little bit of doubt and fear to make vaccine rates drop for example a young girl died tragically not long after getting the vaccine and it got a lot of press but it was later found that she died of a completely unrelated cause this sadly is expected more than million doses of gardasil have been given worldwide and given that huge number it s a statistical certainty that some young people will die not long after getting them but as the saying goes correlation is not causation the vaccines are not to blame here even more frustrating about this vaccine is that it s being fought by an unusual group of people while most anti vax leanings are not affiliated with any particular political persuasion gardasil gets attacked additionally by conservatives who think that girls getting it will become more promiscuous because hpv is a sexually transmitted disease however this has been shown to be false worse these same people tend to promote abstinence only education which has been shown conclusively to be the worst possible sex education kids taught his way tend to have more pregnancies and more stis than ones who are taught progressive healthy sex ed it s like bizarro world where everything is backward all the evidence shows gardasil to be safe and to be effective against a virus that causes horrific illnesses it also shows that the claims made by anti vaxxers are wrong and that people fighting the vaccine because of their own sexual biases are making things far worse and yet they dig in they insist real science is wrong that their anecdotes are better that the entire medical industry is on the take which is silly beyond reason but that s where we are when it comes to health issues especially ones tied to sexuality reason goes out the window and emotions take over that s why i am very very clear about this i and my family are all up to date with our vaccinations and my daughter has had all three stages of the gardasil vaccine we d have done that if she had been a boy too as a parent as someone who knows and loves someone with an autoimmune disorder and as a person who knows just how truly awful so many diseases are and how easily and safely they can be prevented i am a strong advocate for vaccinations it s your body but it affects literally everyone around you don t listen to the anti vaxxers who just want to scare you get the facts and please talk to your board certified doctor and find out if there are any vaccinations you need how many lives will you save when you do tip o the virion to the refutations of anti vaccine memes group on facebook,1
washington people with mild alzheimer s disease who started taking an experimental eli lilly lly co drug earlier in the course of their disease fared better than patients who started later in a clinical trial the outcome may bolster the company s case that the drug solanezumab can slow the decline of memory and function in mild alzheimer s patients despite prior studies with negative results but the new data aren t final proof of the drug s benefit a separate continuing study due to end in late is designed to more definitively test its efficacy and safety in other studies biogen inc biib announced some new data suggesting that its experimental alzheimer s drug slowed the progression of the disease while researchers said a clinical trial of a roche holding ag compound indicated the therapy reduced the volume of a substance in the brains of patients that is believed to contribute to the disease results of these studies were presented wednesday at the alzheimer s association international conference in washington the data are largely incremental but were still being watched keenly by investors who are looking for signals of potential success after years of failed drug candidates in the alzheimer s space the drug industry trade group the pharmaceutical research and manufacturers association recently released a report calculating that experimental therapies for alzheimer s failed between and while only four drugs made it to market lilly hopes solanezumab becomes the first marketed treatment to slow the worsening of the underlying disease current treatments for alzheimer s can alleviate symptoms but don t slow underlying disease progression jefferies co analyst jeffrey holford estimates the lilly drug could generate peak annual sales of more than billion world wide if it is approved for marketing by regulators a leading theory in alzheimer s research is that the buildup of a sticky protein known as beta amyloid in the brain contributes to the disease lilly s solanezumab is designed to bind to amyloid and clear it from the brain but the amyloid hypothesis hasn t been proven in clinical trials in two large clinical trials reported in solanezumab failed to significantly slow the decline of cognition and functional abilities among the overall population of patients with mild to moderate alzheimer s compared with a placebo other companies drugs targeting amyloid also have failed in trials lilly scientists however said the drug appeared to slow cognitive decline in a subgroup patients with a mild form of the disease the company has continued developing the drug in mild alzheimer s patients since lilly has continued to provide the drug to patients who received it in the earlier trials and patients who originally received a placebo in those studies were allowed to switch over to solanezumab on average the placebo patients started solanezumab months after the earlier patients the new results showed that the patients who started therapy earlier retained an advantage in cognition and daily function over those who started later and that this difference persisted for two years researchers said such a finding is consistent with the hypothesis that solanezumab is modifying the underlying disease some patients receiving solanezumab experienced swelling in the brain and other adverse events but researchers said the drug was generally well tolerated here we have a safe antibody treatment solanezumab that appears to benefit mild alzheimer s disease dementia subjects said paul aisen director of the alzheimer s therapeutic research institute at the university of southern california who presented the results eric siemers an alzheimer s researcher at lilly said the new clinical data increases his confidence in solanezumab but we ll find out if it works or not when a separate continuing study of the drug is completed by the end of in march biogen of cambridge mass announced some results from an early stage clinical trial that showed its drug aducanumab given to a very small group of participants with mild memory problems appeared to reduce the amount of amyloid in the brain the treatment also appeared to slow down cognitive decline particularly at the highest dose of mg kg in these people the results impressed wall street and lifted the company s stock to all time highs rbc capital markets analyst michael yee estimates annual sales of the biogen drug could top billion if it reaches the market the march findings however didn t include all doses of medication at the month time point aducanumab is an antibody that is thought to bind to sticky clumps of the protein amyloid in the brain and causes cells to digest away the plaque and reduce amyloid said alfred sandrock biogen s chief medical officer on wednesday researchers presented biogen s full one year data of all four medication doses at one year of treatment as well as more participants in the placebo arm of the study the results were largely consistent with the march analyses i breathed a huge sigh of relief after seeing the biogen data said mark schoenebaum biotech and pharmaceuticals analyst at evercore isi with a roche compound called gantenerumab new results in a subset of participants of the biomarker and brain imaging data showed that the compound did appear to reduce amyloid plaque as hypothesized nearly two years after the start of treatment a trial of the therapy was discontinued in december after a preplanned look at the data in the middle of the study suggested the treatment wasn t making an impact on cognition that means the compound appears to work the way it is theorized to yet still didn t appear to influence cognitive decline raising questions about whether removing amyloid plaque yields a benefit on cognition philip scheltens director of the alzheimer center at the vu university medical center in amsterdam who presented the data to media said the findings suggested the doses tested were too low to be effective a researcher at switzerland based roche announced wednesday it is going to investigate a higher dose of the compound in an extension of the trial researchers at axovant sciences of bermuda whose drug candidate rvt works on neurotransmitters in the brain presented a new analysis of data from its previously reported clinical trial these data which included only the participants to finish the trial were consistent with previously announced data which included everyone who started the trial whether they dropped out or not write to peter loftus at and shirley s wang at,1
en español sunday july healthday news it s still very early but scientists say a test based on a patient s saliva might someday help detect alzheimer s disease saliva is easily obtained safe and affordable and has promising potential for predicting and tracking cognitive decline but we re in the very early stages of this work and much more research is needed study author shraddha sapkota a neuroscience graduate student at the university of alberta in canada said in a news release from the alzheimer s association the study was to be presented sunday at the alzheimer s association international conference in washington d c experts note that studies presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal in the study sapkota s team tested the saliva of people with alzheimer s disease people with what s known as mild cognitive impairment a decline in memory and thinking that s sometimes a precursor to dementia as well as people whose mental skills were normal for their age they found that the saliva of people with alzheimer s had different levels of certain substances compared to the saliva of healthy people or those with mild cognitive impairment experts agreed that the findings held promise but much more research will be needed this is a very preliminary study with a small number of subjects and the results are far from conclusive said dr allison reiss head of the inflammation section at winthrop university hospital in mineola n y she believes the current study lacks information on possible confounding factors things such as coexisting illnesses medications hydration state tobacco use and multiple other variables that could influence what s found in the saliva samples there are many gaps in the evidence reiss said it is uncertain whether the strength and consistency of the relationship between these metabolites in saliva and alzheimer s risk will be maintained in a large multicenter study still dr paul wright chair of neurology at north shore university hospital in manhasset n y said the research is still in its infancy but very promising if a saliva test lives up to its promise one advantage is the ease of obtaining a sample he said but that convenience also brings its own problems wright added people might ask for a test even when they don t show any signs of dementia and this may result in anxiety and depression if there is a false positive result he said for that reason larger studies are needed to corroborate and validate their findings wright said more information the u s national institute on aging has more about alzheimer s disease,1
the latest advances in alzheimer s disease involve people who don t appear to show any signs of cognitive decline yet experts now believe that the biological processes behind the neurodegenerative condition begin years if not decades before memory problems and confusion become noticeable at the annual alzheimer s association international conference researchers say they have found a series of substances in saliva that can distinguish between people who experience normal aging those with mild cognitive dementia mci which in some cases can lead to alzheimer s and in other cases not and alzheimer s disease presenting at the meeting shraddha sapkota a graduate student in neuroscience at university of alberta and her colleagues described how they carefully analyzed the saliva of a group of volunteers participating in an aging study some had been diagnosed with alzheimer s and some with mci while others did not have any neurological conditions by comparing their saliva components the scientists found that each of the three groups showed slightly different patterns of compounds which could form the basis of a relatively easy and non invasive way to determine which people are at higher risk of developing more serious degenerative brain conditions the results aren t conclusive enough yet for doctors to start using them to distinguish people who are more likely to develop alzheimer s but that s the goal says sapkota ideally for example isolating those with mci might help doctors to focus in on a group of patients who might be at higher risk of developing alzheimer s and therefore might need more intensive and regular testing contact us at,0

a refreshing outdoor shower an icy cocktail and a comfortable spot to watch the sunset one could argue that the most relaxing parts of a sunny summer day don t happen until it s over keeping skin healthy in the bright light of day is hard work the devotion to hats and rash guards the careful selection of sunscreen and thorough application and reapplication every minutes is at best tedious and when children are involved the process can be truly demoralizing but once the towels are hung on the line in the soft light of dusk your work is done right not so fast though women have been pummeled with information on sunscreen and other uv protection products few know what they can do to minimize sun damage after they go inside christine lennon and dr darrell rigal join tanya rivero photo getty a new school of thought in the beauty world is pushing the idea that what you put on your skin after a day at the beach could play a part in reducing sun damage one proponent of the concept is hillary peterson founder of bay area based company true nature botanicals ms peterson a former marketing executive began to explore the use of all natural products several years ago after surviving melanoma the most serious type of skin cancer her take on sun exposure is refreshingly pragmatic the message with protection has been to stay out of the sun said ms peterson but i m on the phone with you from hawaii and can see at least people on the beach soaking in the rays my kids are outside playing i know that it s not realistic to say no sun she is however quite knowledgeable about how to be safe when you re in the sun she s also called on terrence collins the teresa heinz professor of green chemistry at carnegie mellon university as a consultant to formulate her line ms peterson has long been aware of the role that antioxidants play in protecting skin from uv damage a groundbreaking study in proved antioxidants like vitamins c and e can boost the efficacy of sunscreen and make skin more resistant to damage she even brews antioxidant rich green tea lets it cool and puts it in a spray bottle i spritz my kids with it before i apply sunscreen and again after they come out of the sun she said twilight treatments three great after sun products pacific mist and pacific face oil tnbotanicals com one love organics gardenia tea antioxidant body serum pharmaca com amend antioxidant sprayable lotion blissoma com photo f martin ramin the wall street journal styling by anne cardenas now a new study by yale university cancer researchers published this year shows that the cell damaging effects of ultra violet rays may continue for some time after you seek cover ergo it may be necessary to draw out the day s protective ministrations into nighttime this information is in the early stages of transforming the category of after sun care a category traditionally limited to aloe vera laden moisturizers and gels that lowered the temperature of sun parched skin but not much else product formulators are now seeing after sun care as another line of defense to stop cell mutations and aging in its tracks ms peterson recommends her pacific mist spray which contains antioxidant rich green tea and white tea extracts as well as sea fennel extract which aids in hydration and the line s pacific face oil which contains a mix of oils from chia seed kiwi passion fruit and papaya seed all rich in essential fatty acids and antioxidants when shopping for other after sun treatments be aware that some labels only add a trace ineffective amount of a beneficial ingredient to a product in order to tout its effects on the label while others have a bona fide antioxidant slant my kids are outside playing i know that it s not realistic to say no sun one love organics a year old company founded by ex lawyer suzanne leroux is a fine example of the latter based in st simons island ga the brand has an eco cert certified lab that creates mostly organic botanical based face and body treatments developed with sun exposure in mind ms leroux typically recommends layering the brand s vitamin c body oil or the gardenia tea antioxidant body serum under sunscreen during the day rich with botanical oils and green tea extract both are also ideal after sun products our lab is on an island in the south we think about sun exposure a lot she added after sun care converts should also look for products dispensed in a pump or spray which keeps contents from oxidizing when exposed to air like blissoma s pomegranate extract filled amend antioxidant sprayable lotion avoid products formulated with alcohol which can dry skin out not everyone is convinced of the effectiveness of after sun care beverly hills based dermatologist rhonda rand believes most products can only lower skin temperature and add moisture that can make sun exposed skin feel better she said but there s nothing you can do to reverse sun exposure and while henry lim president of the american academy of dermatology believes that the yale study was important he cautions that you only have a three hour window after sun exposure to take advantage of any potential product benefits and that antioxidants are notoriously not very stable and must be formulated carefully in order to be effective but believers like true nature botanicals ms peterson are undeterred in medicine you need a definitive study she countered we can t get doctors to say if you eat a healthier diet your body will function better but by bringing omega and and antioxidants to the skin we re giving it more of the tools it needs to handle sun exposure,1
by dennis thompson healthday reporter monday july healthday news a scan of calcium deposits inside your arteries can help doctors deduce how long you re likely to live a new study has found the test called a coronary calcium scan uses a regular ct scan to look for calcium deposits in the three major arteries that carry blood away from the heart said lead author leslee shaw a professor of cardiology at emory university in atlanta people with the largest amounts of calcium in their arteries carry an early death risk that s six times greater than those with no calcium deposits researchers found in a year study of nearly patients if you had no calcium or very small amounts we were able to track over a very long time that you actually had a very outstanding survival shaw said calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls shaw said these plaques which are caused by blood cholesterol build up over time and cause arteries to narrow leading to heart disease as the heart works harder to pump blood through the body if a plaque bursts a blood clot can form on its surface blocking blood flow and causing a heart attack according to the u s national institutes of health if the clot breaks free it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke to prevent plaques from bursting the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them shaw said doctors learned in the s that these calcified plaques show up on ct scans and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries shaw said up to now however there s been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person s long term health risk the study authors said in background information most studies involving these scans have a follow up of five years or less in this new study doctors referred healthy patients in the nashville area between and to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military s tricare healthcare system the patients underwent a calcium scan and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors researchers then tracked the participants for roughly years taking special note of the patients who died analysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person s major arteries patients with small levels of arterial calcium had a percent increased overall risk of death compared to those with no calcium deposits at all but people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium this is not a new test but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors said dr william zoghbi past president of the american college of cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for houston methodist hospital calcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems zoghbi said this study confirms their usefulness in that regard he said calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms he said the best use is in patients who have no symptoms but the value of the test is not well known the results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves shaw said it can be a very potent motivator she said people with many calcium deposits can improve their long term prospects by eating right exercising and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure elevated blood cholesterol and type diabetes shaw said shaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person s regular physical exam as common as blood cholesterol tests they generally cost less than she said i think it s headed that way she said we re kind of on the edge of this becoming more accepted the findings appear in the july issue of annals of internal medicine more information for more on coronary calcium scans visit the u s national institutes of health,1
a growing body of evidence suggests that weight loss surgery is more effective than diet and exercise at getting rid of type diabetes a small but rigorous randomized trial published wednesday in jama surgery provides the latest evidence showing the superiority of bariatric surgery over lifestyle changes in resolving the chronic condition involving high blood sugar in the trial obese adults with diabetes were randomly assigned to one of two surgical procedures or intensive lifestyle intervention and followed for three years forty percent of those who had received a gastric bypass procedure and who received a gastric band were considered in remission from diabetes and no longer needed to take medication after three years in comparison no one in the group who received intensive lifestyle intervention resolved their diabetes i do think it adds strongly to the growing body of data that surgery should be considered to treat people with obesity and diabetes said anita courcoulas head of minimally invasive bariatric and general surgery at the university of pittsburgh school of medicine who led the study however to conclude firmly that surgery is the better option data from more patients across several different treatment centers followed for up to seven years after surgery is needed according to dr courcoulas her group is conducting such a study along with researchers from the university of washington in seattle the joslin diabetes center in boston and the cleveland clinic the american diabetes association lists surgery as one option in its medical care guidelines for diabetic patients with a body mass index over but says there is insufficient evidence of benefit in those who are less overweight in general i agree that short term outcomes for bariatric surgery are more dramatic than that seen with lifestyle intervention wrote jane chiang senior vice president for medical affairs and community information at the american diabetes association in an email however not everyone is a strong candidate for bariatric surgery treatment should be tailored to each patient she said the ada s professional practice committee which develops its medical guidelines will carefully review the study and assess if any changes to clinical practice are warranted according to dr chiang in the international diabetes federation announced a position change stating that surgical options should be considered earlier on for eligible patients to help prevent complications from type diabetes the new study which began in didn t look at a bariatric surgery procedure that has become popular in recent years known as the sleeve gastrectomy said dr courcoulas however a study by the cleveland clinic published last year in the new england journal of medicine did and found a similar significant improvement in type diabetes after bariatric surgery procedures including the sleeve gastrectomy over lifestyle intervention why bariatric surgery clears up diabetes isn t fully understood and patients have different degrees of response to the procedures said dr courcoulas patients who undergo surgery usually lose significantly more weight than those receiving lifestyle intervention but their diabetes often clears up before they lose a significant amount of weight suggesting that weight loss alone isn t the reason some doctors say gastric bypass surgery appears especially beneficial possibly because the procedure involves reducing the stomach to the size of a small pouch and bypassing a portion of the intestine which potentially changes certain gastrointestinal hormones or other factors michel gagner a clinical professor of surgery at florida international university who wasn t involved in the study but wrote an editorial accompanying the piece in the journal said bariatric surgery should be used much more widely to treat diabetes the way that heart surgery was widely used to treat coronary artery disease i don t know how many studies we need to do to keep comparing the best medical treatment to surgery but it s clear to me that surgery is the only thing that offers resolution to diabetes said dr gagner write to shirley s wang at,1

reuters health patients who need to be rehospitalized within a month after major surgery have a lower risk of death over the next two months if they return to the hospital where they had the surgery rather than going to a different facility according to a new study most clinicians or surgeons feel like if you take the time to do a big operation on someone you know the area operated on how the operations went if there were complications lead author dr benjamin s brooke of the university of utah school of medicine in salt lake city told reuters health by phone doctors who did not perform the surgery won t have that context which may explain part of the survival benefit of returning to the original hospital he said he and his team analyzed medicare claims data from to on patients readmitted to the hospital within days after major surgeries including coronary artery bypass surgery removal of the colon or pancreas and hip or knee replacement more than nine million patients underwent one of such surgeries during the study period and between six and percent depending on the surgery were readmitted to the hospital within a month more than half the time patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery those who returned to the original hospital were percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital as reported in the lancet patients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication either medical or surgical drs justin b dimick and david c miller both of the university of michigan wrote in an editorial patients readmitted at the original hospital also tended to be readmitted one to two days earlier than those who ended up at different hospitals it might be harder for patients to get appropriate care at the other hospitals where they don t have a pre existing relationship with a surgeon and so treatment might be delayed dimick and miller wrote if you are a surgeon or clinician who takes care of this person it s intuitive that going back to that surgeon would influence how well they do brooke said for complex operations some patients will fly to prestigious hospitals from several hundred miles away he said if these patients have complications weeks later they end up going to a local hospital not the one where they had surgery a lot of big fortune companies contract with bigger hospitals for patients undergoing major surgery brooke said noting the wal mart has contracted with the cleveland clinic even if they live in the same city where they had their surgery they might have to call an ambulance to pick them up and the ambulance drivers don t understand how important it is to take them to the same hospital he said ambulance drivers and emergency department doctors should make every effort to get a patient who has had major surgery back to their original hospital he said a lot of readmissions are patients who have time to be transferred or triaged if they are not bleeding to death or having a heart attack he said patients should try to stay in the immediate vicinity of their surgical hospital for at least a week brooke said source bit ly gjde and bit ly guhrga the lancet online june,1

you no longer live in a world where you can pretend you re only eating for one the trillions of bacteria in your gut we now know also feed on what you put in your mouth and they behave very differently depending on what that is it s increasingly clear that the composition of your gut bacteria likely influences your risk for many health problems from obesity and type diabetes and even certain autoimmune diseases scientists are hard at work trying to determine how and why that s that case as well as which bacteria are beneficial and how to protect them a recent study published in the bmj adds to the growing evidence that fiber might be a critical gut nourishing nutrient unfortunately less than of americans eat the government recommended amount daily you really hold the reins to guiding this community of bacteria through the choices you make says justin l sonnenburg phd associate professor in the department of microbiology and immunology at stanford university school of medicine and author of the good gut sonnenburg was not involved with this study but research from his lab also suggests that fiber plays a big role in promoting good bacteria the authors of the new study wanted to look at what changes in diet do to one particular gut microbe species akkermansia muciniphila a strain that s been associated with leanness and better glucose tolerance in mice they wrangled a group of overweight and obese adults took stool and blood samples and asked them to follow a six week calorie restricted diet between calories per day while increasing their fiber intake the diet was followed by six weeks of eating normally they kept a food journal throughout and the researchers biopsied their fat tissue the people who had more akkermansia in their gut from the very start had better clinical measures after they completed the diet compared to the people with less of the bacterium both groups of people lost the same amount of weight but the high akkermansia group had a stronger decrease in visceral fat than the others says study author patrice d cani phd professor and group leader of the metabolism and nutrition research group at université catholique de louvain in belgium we discovered that the patients who exhibited higher amounts of akkermansia were the patients who had a very strong improvement in cholesterol in glycemia in waist to hip ratio and also a reduction in different parameters in both cardiovascular disease and risk factors higher levels of akkermansia the findings suggest seem to have favorable effects on health the good news is that your initial akkermansia levels are not your fate people who started out with lower stores of akkermansia had more after they followed the fiber rich calorie restricted diet you can increase these bacterial populations by eating fiber cani s research suggests which acts as a prebiotic in the gut and has a beneficial effect on some bacteria now cani says he is working on an experiment with obese and diabetic patients to administer akkermansia alone without any dietary modifications to see what effect it has on insulin resistance and cardiovascular disease risk factors if we can improve these different parameters that would be something great he says get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now choose your country united states of america afghanistan

important to intestinal flora your gut microbes feed on it and produce short chain fatty acids which get absorbed into the bloodstream and regulate the immune system and attenuate inflammation sonnenburg says that means if you re not eating dietary fiber your immune system may be existing in kind of a simmering pro inflammatory state he says the very state that predisposes us to different western diseases our diet and deteriorated microbiota are really a major piece of the puzzle in trying to understand why western diseases are rising like crazy sonnenburg says that when researchers try on mice what many of us do on a regular basis eat food depleted of dietary fiber their gut microbes behave erratically they turn and start eating the mucus lining of the intestine says sonnenburg because that s also a carbohydrate source and it s kind of a fallback food for them in mice on a low fiber diet the mucus lining thins to about half of its normal width he says it s so far unclear whether the same thing happens in humans but sonnenburg thinks it might we start to see these correlates that we think over the course of decades in a human could lead to something problematic he says loading up on fiber fortified processed foods isn t likely a good way to increase the kind of fiber that benefits the gut studies done on single fibers those like inulin which are added to foods haven t shown to have the same effects as fiber that occur naturally in whole foods all of the vegetables we re encouraged to eat by our mothers and by the government guidelines these are all filled with fiber and filled with a diversity of fiber and probably the best route for encouraging a diverse microbiota sonnenburg says nuts seeds whole grains legumes and even dark chocolate are high in fiber as are vegetables you can eat massive amounts of plant material and it can be incredibly good for you you can feel really satisfied and full sonnenburg says i find that a really nice way to eat just kind

researchers at md anderson cancer center in houston have identified a large and readily detectable molecule that circulates in the blood and has identified with perfect accuracy and no false positives the presence of pancreatic cancer in a small group of subjects searching blood samples of pancreatic cancer patients and controls for a distinctive molecule given off by the malignancy scientists were even able to distinguish subjects with benign pancreatic disease from those with early stage cancer the telltale sign of pancreas cancer was found in protein and nucleic acid filled sacs called exosomes which circulate in the bloodstream spinning blood samples in a centrifuge researchers found they could break open those sacs and readily detect a protein called glypican which is overexpressed in breast and pancreatic cancers the finding offers the possibility for early detection of pancreatic cancer and help in designing potential curative surgical options the authors of the new research wrote for a cancer that has already metastasized in four of five patients newly diagnosed earlier detection holds a strong promise of improving pancreatic cancer s dismal survival rate they added advertisement pancreatic cancer is the deadliest of all common cancers in the united states an estimated are diagnosed with the malignancy each year in the country usually when it has reached a very advanced stage and few treatment options are effective just of those diagnosed with this form of malignancy survive five or more years clotilde thery a cancer researcher at france s institut curie greeted the possibility with enthusiasm the potential implications of such a test are huge thery wrote in an editorial published alongside the study in the journal nature although she said its findings need to be replicated in much larger groups she hailed the finding as clinically important uc san francisco cancer physician alan venook cautioned however that much more needs to be known about the telltale sign of cancer explored in the new research before its lifesaving properties can be established advertisement the issue is can you detect these in patients that don t have advanced cancer venook said the answer is we don t know the numbers tested by the md anderson researchers patients with pancreatic cancer five of whom had very early lesions with chronic pancreatitis and healthy controls aren t nearly large enough to draw such conclusions and getting a clear answer venook said would probably require lengthy and expensive studies on very large populations for the record june p m an earlier version of this article underreported the number of people tested for the glypican protein by the md anderson researchers participants with pancreatic cancer numbered not healthy controls numbered not those with chronic pancreatitis numbered not six don t get me wrong this is where we start this is a very cool observation well worth following but this is not a biomarker yet venook said follow me on twitter latmelissahealy and like los angeles times science health on facebook,1

annual incidence rate of developing a primary malignant brain tumor is n population and the lifetime risk is percent in addition metastases from systemic cancer to the brain are times more common than primary malignancy of the brain brain tumors can develop in both males and females and at any age though they re more common in adults the most common type of primary malignant brain tumors is malignant glioma brain tumors are diagnosed with clinical symptoms as well as advance imaging modalities of the brain such as computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging conventional surgery is usually the first step to have tissue diagnosis and decrease the burden of tumor however it s not a cure for malignant brain tumors and is usually followed by other types of adjuvant treatments such as radiation and or chemotherapy not all brain tumors are amenable to conventional surgery for multiple reasons such as location in deep parts of the brain with limited surgical access or being adjacent to critical structures in addition in some conditions increased risk of morbidity is seen after surgery like in recurrent tumors with prior radiation or surgery these patients especially in the recurrent setting have limited treatment options focused high dose radiation like stereotactic radiosurgery is useful in brain metastasis and could be used as initial treatment however radiosurgery is not useful for malignant primary brain tumors like gliomas and even in metastasis it does have variable degree of failure based upon the size of tumor and prescribed radiation dose patients who are suffering from deep seated or recurrent primary brain tumors as well as those with brain metastases who failed radiation have limited options and may benefit from alternative treatments like laser ablation laser ablation is a minimally invasive treatment modality for brain tumors that uses laser technology to increase the temperature of tumor and subsequently kill tumor cells it also might have a role in enhancement of chemotherapy and radiation therapy effects by disruption of repair mechanisms in tumor cells and increase the permeability of blood vessels of brain unlike conventional surgery it doesn t need extensive surgical exposure actually it works through a small stab incision in the skin and a small hole in the skull laser probe will be inserted using intra operative navigation and controlled firing of the laser will cause an increase in the temperature of tumor and eventually destruction of tumor cells although this technology has been around for decades new technical advancements like specific mr thermometric scans during surgery have an almost real time measurement of brain temperature and control of the extension of treatment field which allows the robotic probe driver to change direction and the depth of laser probe during surgery to have complete coverage of the tumor plus a completely newly designed laser probe with a built in cooling system prevents excessive temperature of the probe during surgery which has made a resurgence of this treatment modality for intracranial applications in recent years since five years ago when the neuroblate system was approved by the food and drug administration hundreds of patients with brain tumors who used to be considered inoperable underwent this procedure successfully with promising outcomes it s especially crucial for patients with brain tumors in difficult to access locations as well as for those who have experienced failure of prior radiation treatment being a relatively new procedure neuroblate doesn t yet qualify as a standard treatment for brain tumors however initial results have been promising and further studies are on the way,1

the first procedure carries a percent risk of collapsing a lung pneumothorax as well as infection the second is serious surgery that requires general anesthesia and results in the loss of lung tissue both are in patient procedures that carry the cost and other risks of hospitalizations in about a third of the surgeries the growth turns out to be benign meaning the surgery was unnecessary but now according to a study published sunday in the new england journal of medicine there appears to be a new much less invasive way of determining whether a growth is malignant researchers at boston university have discovered that the thin epithelial cells that line the entire airway show changes that indicate whether a growth is malignant with small brushes on the bronchoscope they can take some of those cells and using genomic testing that has been available only in recent years reach a conclusion ad ad the study released sunday showed that the tests were about percent accurate on subjects a private company has purchased the technology and is making it available to hospitals across the country even though lung cancer tends to develop deep in your lung all the cells that line your airway are exposed said avrum spira a professor of medicine at boston university who led the research they have changes in their genome spira s test focuses on messenger rna the molecules that express genes instructions to cells he called the technology a canary in the coal mine for lung cancer which kills about people in the united states each year ad if the test is negative its accuracy will allow doctors to wait and watch a lesion if it shows a malignancy a biopsy still would be needed to confirm the cancer there will still be a small number of biopsies spira said but we re going to reduce them significantly ad other research is being conducted to find markers for lung cancer though much of it focuses on substances that can be found in the blood spira said with the vast majority of lung cancer victims being smokers the epithelial cells show changes that could be tracked once the technology became available he said the next logical question is whether those changes might be detected early enough to predict and prevent lung cancer spira said his team already is working on research to determine whether that s possible ad the current advance was a long time in coming and shows the difficulty of bringing research from the lab to the consumer spira said the initial discovery was made years ago but he couldn t find any private group willing to put up the millions of dollars needed to conduct studies work through the government and academic regulatory process and bring his idea to market ad seven years ago he formed his own company raised venture capital and eventually proved that his idea worked now his company has been purchased by veracyte which will take over the production and marketing of the bronchial genomic classifier we were adding seconds to a minute to the length of a bronchoscopy spira said even then the regulatory hurdles were significant we got over them all but they were significant correction the original version of this post incorrectly named the company that is distributing the bronchial genomic classifier this version has been corrected ad,1
a new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer it doesn t involve any high priced new pharmaceuticals the key may be an over the counter vitamin supplement that costs less than a month researchers found that a form of vitamin b called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who ve had it before another popular form of vitamin b called niacin was not used in this study for the study researchers in australia looked at nearly people who had had at least two non melanoma skin cancers they found patients who took vitamin b twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by percent that s a dramatic number dr david agus director of usc s norris westside cancer center told cbs this morning it could make a major impact vitamin b could help skin cancer patients dr jae jung a dermatologist at city of hope cancer center in duarte california agreed if you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients it would be an enormous benefit she told cbs news how does it work sunlight s ultraviolet uv rays can damage the dna in skin cells increasing the risk for skin cancer researchers say vitamin b gives skin cells an energy boost turns back on the immune system in agus s words helping them repair the damage nearly million people are treated for skin cancer in the u s each year and the skin cancer foundation says out of americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime the two most common forms of the disease basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma can usually be treated successfully the most dangerous type melanoma occurs in about people in the u s each year and kills more than one patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is charity wiese who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years she said she s had quite a few on the top of my head a few on the back of my head one behind each ear even though she tries to stay out of the sun wiese had leukemia as a teenager and underwent radiation therapy which put her at high risk for skin cancer later in life wiese thinks the vitamin study sounds promising i am absolutely willing to try it and hope for the best she said doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin b nicotinamide it s safe it s almost obscenely inexpensive and it s already widely commercially available dr diona damian the senior author of the study and a professor of dermatology at the university of sydney told healthday but she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it it s not something we d recommend at this stage for the general population damian said she also noted that the benefits appear to wear off when patients stop taking the supplements results of the study are being presented at the annual meeting of the american society of clinical oncology later this month,1
for headaches a lifestyle change may be better than a doctor visit enlarge this image keith negley for npr keith negley for npr terri bradford has suffered debilitating headaches all her life some days the pain is so bad she says by o clock in the morning i m on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice i ve had two spinal taps i ve had so many nerve blocks i ve lost count over the years bradford who is years old and lives in bedford mass has searched desperately for pain relief she s been to the doctor countless times for countless tests everything i ve had i ve had twice she says i ve had two spinal taps i ve had so many nerve blocks i ve lost count bradford is not alone it s estimated that every year million americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines people who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment a study finds that testing is expensive it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful says lead researcher dr john mafi of beth israel deaconess medical center in boston mafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like ct scans and mris in people with headaches as well as referrals to other doctors presumably specialists he found that from to the number of diagnostic tests rose from percent of all doctor visits to percent at the same time referrals to other doctors increased from percent to percent in other words almost double what it was a decade ago mafi says this isn t because more people are suffering headaches the headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade but what has changed is supply and demand today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago and more patients are asking to be tested there s a subconscious perception that fancier more expensive tests are better and that equals better care patients are more assertive than ever before mafi says they do research online are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding i think i need an mri and while an informed patient is a good thing mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong i think there s a subconscious perception that more is better and that fancier more expensive tests are better and that equals better care mafi s study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches he only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches and in these cases repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies on top of that exposure to radiation in tests like ct scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers for terri bradford the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile i ve been to four neurologists a lot of them have given up on me because i haven t gotten any better she says eventually bradford ended up at beth israel deaconess medical center where neurologist carolyn bernstein directs the comprehensive headache center bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like bradford the majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they re really miserable with the pain bernstein says they say i hope you have a magic pill and of course there is no magic pill there is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger if you are a migraine sufferer and i expose you to the right trigger you re going to have a migraine bernstein says but the triggers are different for different people they can include poor diet too much sugar or certain types of alcohol problems sleeping stress lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches at the headache center patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns disability and mood assessments then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future some people find relief through exercise i write an exercise prescription probably as often as i write a prescription for medication bernstein says she acknowledges it s sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise but even a little can help and according to bernstein it doesn t have to be jogging for miles and miles it can be yoga tai chi or even just a little stretching a big lifestyle adjustment worked for terri bradford she started exercising and changed her diet giving up gluten dairy and sugar and she learned how to meditate to reduce stress all these changes she says have made a huge difference she has far fewer headaches and when she does have them they re far less severe i m finally healing she says,1

photo the type of sugar you eat may affect your cravings for high calorie foods researchers report an experiment with healthy volunteers found that compared with consuming glucose consuming fructose the sugar found in fruits honey and corn syrup resulted in more activity in the brain s reward regions increased responses to images of food and a tendency to choose eating a high calorie food over a future monetary reward the volunteers drank a ounce glass of cherry flavored liquid that contained two and a half ounces of fructose or glucose table sugar or sucrose extracted from sugar cane or sugar beets is a compound of glucose and fructose researchers also took blood samples to measure levels of glucose fructose and insulin and of leptin and ghrelin enzymes involved in controlling hunger and feelings of fullness before having their drinks the participants rated their desire to eat on a one to scale from not at all to very much then they drank the liquids and had functional magnetic resonance imaging brain scans while looking at images of food and of neutral objects like buildings or baskets as they did so they rated their hunger using the scale the volunteers were then presented with images of high calorie foods and asked whether they would like to have the food now or a monetary award a month later instead the study published in the journal pnas found that compared with glucose consuming fructose produced greater responses to food cues in the orbital frontal cortex of the brain a region that plays an important role in reward processing the fructose drink also produced greater activity in the visual cortex when volunteers looked at images of food a finding that suggests increased craving compared with glucose when choosing between tasty high calorie food or a delayed monetary reward fructose drinkers were more likely than glucose drinkers to choose the food there was no difference in leptin or ghrelin levels between fructose and glucose drinkers but plasma insulin response was sharply lower in fructose drinkers which may affect what we eat according to the senior author dr kathleen a page an assistant professor of clinical medicine at the keck school of medicine of the university of southern california insulin is released when we consume glucose she said the pancreas secretes insulin and insulin drives glucose into cells so that it can be used for energy but it also sends a signal to the brain that says you ve eaten fructose doesn t stimulate insulin secretion and if there s no insulin you don t get the information that you re full does this mean that it is a good idea to avoid fruit because it contains fructose no dr page said don t stop eating fruit it has a relatively low amount of sugar compared with processed foods and soft drinks maybe grams in an orange compared with grams in a ounce can of soda and it is packed with fiber which helps slow down the absorption of food which makes you feel full for more fitness food and wellness news like our facebook page,1

en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter sunday april healthday news taking aspirin regularly over several years may help prevent gastrointestinal cancers a new study suggests there was a percent lower risk of cancers of the gastrointestinal tract especially in the colon and rectum among people taking aspirin said lead researcher yin cao a postdoctoral research fellow at the harvard school of public health in boston but cao doesn t think people should start taking aspirin to prevent cancer until more research is done the results of ongoing research to develop more tailored treatment based upon a personalized assessment of risks and benefits is critical before recommending aspirin for preventing cancer she said moreover patients and their doctors need to consider the potential risks of taking aspirin including stomach bleeding cao said however if considered alongside the known benefits of aspirin in the prevention of heart attacks and strokes our data suggest the possibility that long term regular aspirin use may have a significant benefit in prevention of the two leading causes of sickness and death in the u s and much of the world she said the results of the study were to be presented sunday at an american association for cancer research meeting in philadelphia the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal for the study cao and her colleagues collected data on women enrolled in the nurses health study in and men enrolled in the health professionals follow up study in the researchers collected data on aspirin use risk factors for cancer and diagnoses of cancer after up to years of follow up about women and men developed cancer the investigators found among men prostate cancer was excluded cao s team found that men and women who took a regular dose of aspirin milligrams two times a week or more had a lower risk of cancer overall than people who did not regularly take aspirin the reduced risk was largely due to fewer cases of gastrointestinal cancers including colon cancer rectal cancer and esophageal cancer regular aspirin use was not associated with a reduced risk of other cancers specifically no link was found between aspirin use and a lower risk of breast cancer advanced prostate cancer or lung cancer the researchers said moreover the benefit of aspirin in reducing overall cancer risk appeared to depend on how much one took so the more aspirin taken the more the risk was reduced amounts ranged from less than one aspirin a week to or more the researchers said getting the biggest benefit from aspirin required taking it for at least years the benefit was no longer seen within four years of stopping it the researchers found and the study only showed an association between aspirin use and gastrointestinal cancer risk not a cause and effect relationship the association of aspirin with reduced cancer risk was the same for women and men regardless of race history of diabetes family history of cancer weight smoking regular use of other painkillers or taking multivitamins the study authors added eric jacobs strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the american cancer society said the new study confirms the now well established link between regular aspirin use and lower risk of developing certain cancers of the gastrointestinal tract cancers of the colon rectum and esophagus some though not all previous studies have indicated that aspirin might slightly lower risk of certain other cancers including breast cancer prostate cancer and lung cancer he added although aspirin is recommended for most people who have had a heart attack and has some benefits for cancer risk as well at this point the american cancer society does not recommend that people use aspirin specifically to prevent cancer because it is not clear that the benefits with respect to cancer outweigh the risks jacobs said while not common aspirin can cause serious even occasionally fatal stomach bleeding even at low doses he said people who are uncertain about whether they should be using aspirin should talk to their health care provider who knows their personal medical history and can help weigh their individual risks and benefits jacobs said more information visit the u s national cancer institute for more on aspirin and cancer risk,1

eating for two is exciting but comes with a lot of baggage weight gain uncontrollable cravings for ice cream and pickles and constant concern over whether your growing baby is getting all the nutrients it needs to name a few now findings published in applied physiology nutrition and metabolism reveal that most women aren t getting enough omega fatty acids healthy fats found in fish walnuts avocados and supplements specifically they aren t getting enough dha docosahexaenoic acid an omega long chain polyunsaturated fatty acid omega lcpufa that s critical to a baby s brain development dha is primarily obtained by eating fish and other seafood for the study researchers from canada s university of alberta studied women during and after pregnancy to monitor their intake of omega lcpufas these include dha epa eicosapentaenoic acid and dpa docosapentaenoic acid dha is believed to be the biggest player in neurological health and is the primary structural fat found in the brain the american dietetic association recommends that healthy adults including pregnant and lactating women get at least milligrams per day of omega lcpufas meanwhile the international society for the study of fatty acids and lipids advises that pregnant and lactating women consume at least mg of dha per day the researchers found that only percent of women during pregnancy and percent of women three months postpartum were meeting those dha recommendations the power of dha omega s are needed for the infant s brain and nervous system to develop properly says contributing study author catherine field a registered dietitian and professor of nutrition at the university of alberta also the membranes of every cell in a person s body contain omega fatty acids they are needed for the cell to grow and function after all during pregnancy and breastfeeding babies are doing at lot of growing what s more during pregnancy omega fatty acids are required for mom s body to produce more red blood cells so that she can provide enough nutrients and oxygen to her growing baby these fatty acids also help the placenta grow and function as needed field says it s this placenta that omega fatty acids including dha diffuse across to reach the baby and spur brain development says dr vincenzo berghella past president of the society for maternal fetal medicine as well as professor and director of the division of maternal fetal medicine at thomas jefferson university in philadelphia not surprisingly low intake of dha in moms is linked to babies with lower cognitive development often associated with crying and poor sleep as well as lower iqs and attention deficit disorders field says what s more her previous research in both animals and humans shows that dha intake during breastfeeding impacts infants immune system development which may explain why babies who receive low amounts of dha through breast milk have an increased risk of asthma and allergies she also notes that dha supplementation may help prevent preterm labor preeclampsia and postpartum depression however whether dha benefits more than babies brain health isn t conclusive data from observational studies and from randomized controlled trials suggest that omega during pregnancy could be associated with several benefits such as lower risk of preterm birth preeclampsia and other obstetrics complications however there are contradicting results berghella says in fact berghella s review of randomized controlled trials found that omega supplementation during pregnancy was not associated with decreases in risk however the review did find that women with single child pregnancies no multiples had a percent lower risk of stillbirth or early infant death if they began supplementation by weeks into their pregnancies how to get more dha sushi s one thing but during pregnancy you shouldn t lay off seafood entirely berghella says the american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists recommends that pregnant and breastfeeding women eat at least two servings of fish or shellfish about to ounces every week but take care to choose low mercury options such as shrimp salmon and catfish the group recommends avoiding shark swordfish king mackerel and tilefish and limiting white tuna consumption to ounces per week hitting those recommendations will get you approximately mg of dha per week berghella says while that s not exactly mg per day if you average your intake out over the course of a day week you still hit recommended amounts in the university of alberta study seafood fish and seaweed products contributed to percent of women s omega lcpufa intakes from food the biggest source salmon good thing as a study published in the lancet found that children born to mothers who reported no seafood intake had the greatest risk of behavioral problems and poor scores on early developmental and iq tests if you don t eat seafood dha supplements can help says dr gabriele saccone of the university of naples federico ii s department of neuroscience and berghella s collaborator but if you do take supplements opt for fish oil varieties since dha from fish may be more beneficial than getting it from vegetarian supplements according to saccone and no worries they are low in mercury even if you are eating some seafood just not quite two servings per week a fish oil supplement could still help in the current study women who took a supplement were times more likely to get mg of dha per week during pregnancy and lactation compared to those who went supplement free apart from taking supplements field also recommends eating foods enriched with dha such as milk and eggs wondering about avocados walnuts and olive oil while they are all filled with omega fatty acids they aren t of the dha variety these plant sources of omega s contain ala alpha linolenic acid which while good for you has a hard time converting into dha so that it can really benefit baby s brain development berghella says in north americans and europeans only about percent of all ala consumed becomes epa or dha field says,1

the mind diet foods that fight alzheimer s and to avoid istockphoto doctors have been saying for years that what you eat can affect the health of your heart now there s growing evidence that the same is true for your brain a new study by researchers at rush university medical center in chicago shows a diet plan they developed appropriately called the mind diet may reduce the risk of developing alzheimer s disease by as much as percent even those who didn t stick to the diet perfectly but followed it moderately well reduced their risk of alzheimer s by about a third diet appears to be just one of many factors that play into who gets the disease said nutritional epidemiologist martha clare morris phd the lead author of the mind diet study genetics and other factors like smoking exercise and education also play a role but the mind diet helped slow the rate of cognitive decline and protect against alzheimer s regardless of other risk factors the study published in the journal alzheimer s dementia looked at more than people between the ages of and who filled out food questionnaires and underwent repeated neurological testing it found participants whose diets most closely followed the mind recommendations had a level of cognitive function the equivalent of a person years younger the mind diet breaks its recommendations down into brain healthy food groups a person should eat and five unhealthy food groups to avoid it combines many elements of two other popular nutrition plans which have been proven to benefit heart health the mediterranean diet and the dash dietary approaches to stop hypertension diet mind stands for mediterranean dash intervention for neurodegenerative delay but the mind diet also differs from those plans in a few significant ways and proved more effective than either of them at reducing the risk of alzheimer s click through to see which foods to eat and which ones to avoid for optimal brain health green leafy vegetables istockphoto the mind diet recommends frequent servings of green leafy vegetables kale spinach broccoli collards and other greens are packed with vitamins a and c and other nutrients at least two servings a week can help and researchers found six or more servings a week provide the greatest brain benefits the mediterranean and dash diets do not specifically recommend these types of vegetables but the mind diet study found that including greens in addition to other veggies made a difference in reducing the risk of alzheimer s other vegetables istockphoto like other diets focused on weight loss and heart health the mind diet emphasizes the importance of vegetables for brain health the researchers recommend eating a salad and at least one other vegetable every day to reduce the risk of alzheimer s nuts istockphoto nuts are a good snack for brain health according to the mind diet study nuts contain healthy fats fiber and antioxidants and other studies have found they can help lower bad cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease the mind diet recommends eating nuts at least five times a week berries istockphoto berries are the only fruit specifically recommended in the mind diet blueberries are one of the more potent foods in terms of protecting the brain morris said she noted that strawberries have also shown benefits in past studies looking at the effect of food on cognitive function the mind diet recommends eating berries at least twice a week beans istockphoto if beans aren t a regular part of your diet they should be high in fiber and protein and low in calories and fat they also help keep your mind sharp as part of the mind diet the researchers recommend eating beans three times a week to help reduce the risk of alzheimer s whole grains tom perkins whole grains are a key component of the mind diet it recommends at least three servings a day fish istockphoto the mind diet study found eating fish at least once a week helps protect brain function however there s no need to go overboard unlike the mediterranean diet which recommends eating fish almost every day the mind diet says once a week is enough poultry shaiith poultry is another part of a brain healthy eating plan according to the mind diet it recommends two or more servings a week olive oil istockphoto olive oil beat out other forms of cooking oil and fats in the mind diet the researchers found people who used olive oil as their primary oil at home saw greater protection against cognitive decline wine istockphoto raise a toast to the mind diet it recommends a glass of wine every day just one though wine rounds out the list of of brain healthy food groups that help protect against alzheimer s green leafy vegetables other vegetables nuts berries beans whole grains fish poultry olive oil and wine now here are the five food groups it says you should avoid to reduce your risk of developing dementia red meat juniart red meat isn t banned in the mind diet but the researchers say you should limit consumption to no more than four servings a week to help protect brain health that s more generous than the mediterranean diet which restricts red meat to just one serving a week butter and stick margarine istockphoto butter and stick margarine should be limited to less than a tablespoon per day on the mind diet brain healthy olive oil can often be used instead cheese istockphoto cheese may be delicious but it doesn t do your brain any favors according to the mind diet study eat cheese no more than once a week if you want to reduce your risk of alzheimer s pastries and sweets istockphoto you already know they re not so good for your waistline and it turns out pastries and other sweets could have a negative effect on brain health as well the mind diet recommends limiting yourself to no more than five of these treats per week,1

bone health experts are making a new push to reduce rates of osteoporosis with a particular focus on controlling the bone wasting disease in men an important goal is to get greater numbers of men to be tested for osteoporosis when they come to a hospital or clinic with a fracture to the wrist vertebrae or other bones that wasn t from a major accident or trauma doctors call this a fragility fracture one that results from a decrease in bone density a recent study of about people over years old found women were about three times as likely as men versus to be tested using a bone density scan after suffering a distal radial fracture or broken wrist a common warning sign of early osteoporosis the study conducted by researchers at beth israel deaconess medical center in boston was published in the journal of bone and joint surgery bare bones osteoporosis commonly thought of as a women s disease also affects many men osteoporosis occurs when bone tissue breaks down faster than it is replaced causing bones to become less dense and more likely to fracture a broken bone is often the first sign of osteoporosis breakages are most common in the wrist spine or hip about half of women over age will break a bone due to osteoporosis as many as one in four men will suffer a breakage men are twice as likely as women to die in the year following a hip fracture bone density which peaks between ages and declines with age and especially in women after menopause a bone density test a type of xray can diagnose osteoporosis the higher your bone density was at its peak the less likely you are to develop osteoporosis sources national osteoporosis foundati the national bone health alliance a public private partnership managed by the nonprofit national osteoporosis foundation is nearing completion of a year long pilot project at three hospitals to test programs called fracture liaison services that make bone density tests routine for patients over with fragility fractures such tests currently are recommended in the treatment guidelines of various medical groups they also are regularly performed at some u s managed care organizations including kaiser permanente southern california and some national health care systems such as in the u k but experts say the majority of patients in the u s especially men don t get tested for osteoporosis after suffering a fragility fracture osteoporosis is commonly thought of as a women s disease but as many as one in four men in the u s over the age of will break a bone as a result of the condition more than will have prostate cancer according to the national osteoporosis foundation by comparison one out of two women will break a bone from osteoporosis the disease also is a common cause of hip fractures and men are twice as likely as women to die in the year after suffering a broken hip says the switzerland based international osteoporosis foundation the iof made men the focus of world osteoporosis day in october and released an in depth report called osteoporosis in men why change needs to happen robert spezzano an assistant principal at an independent high school in washington d c fell off his bicycle in the fall breaking his wrist and elbow after surgery at medstar georgetown university hospital which is participating in the pilot project he got a call from the hospital s fracture liaison service coordinator suggesting he make an appointment for a bone density test i was real skeptical got real defensive about the term fragility fracture says mr spezzano i fell hard so i wasn t surprised my arm broke when the test results clearly showed osteoporosis mr spezzano says he was blown away my mind was racing you just think it s a woman s disease although his doctor recommended prescription medication mr spezzano says he plans first to sharply step up his exercise regimen and take vitamin d supplements to see if that helps andrea singer leader of the project at medstar georgetown says results of the pilot haven t yet been compiled but the number of patients post fracture who are identified assessed for osteoporosis and put on treatment if needed is up significantly patients aren t necessarily thrilled with the diagnosis but they re thrilled that someone is looking at the whole person dr singer says bone tissue is always breaking down when it isn t replaced fast enough bones become less dense and prone to breakage even with a relatively minor fall or bump tests for osteoporosis include a bone density scan a type of x ray of the hip wrist or spine and blood or urine tests to check calcium and vitamin d levels bone density declines gradually as people age and especially for women after menopause factors like family history and lifestyle contribute to people s risk for getting osteoporosis some medications such as corticosteroids or androgen deprivation therapy for prostate cancer and some underlying medical conditions also can promote the condition when osteoporosis isn t too severe or the patient is relatively young doctors may recommend calcium or vitamin d supplements diet changes or more weight bearing exercise which strengthens bones people with a greater risk of future fractures may be put on medications called bisphosphonates which slow bone breakdown and slightly increase bone mass bisphosphonates sold under brand names such as fosamax and actonel are highly effective but because of some possible rare side effects an unusual type of fracture of the thigh bone and a deterioration of the jaw bone the medication often isn t prescribed for more than five years many men think they can t get osteoporosis a man will say oh it was a really bad fall says richard dell head of kaiser permanente southern california s fracture liaison service until he retired last year care managers at kaiser order a bone density scan for everyone over whose fracture results from a simple fall a clinic sees patients who have abnormal scans does lab tests and prescribes treatment if needed since the service was launched in the rate of hip fractures at kaiser is down says dr dell an improvement he attributes in large part to the fracture liaison service dr dell currently advises the national osteoporosis foundation on its effort to get more hospitals to adopt the services a key goal of the hospital pilot project which is funded by merck co the maker of fosamax is to find out if a fracture liaison service can be effective in a non managed care environment among other things the project has been testing systems to keep track of patients who might receive follow up care from multiple providers it eventually plans to make the systems available to hospitals launching such services although managed care hospital networks can save money by reducing hip fractures in their patients other hospitals stand to forgo or more for every hip surgery they don t perform many experts believe fracture liaison services will be more widely adopted once medicare the big government insurer pegs more of its payments to patients overall health outcomes when they put in more pay for performance programs that s when it will really get attention says douglas dirschl chairman of orthopedic surgery and rehabilitation at university of chicago medicine which isn t participating in the pilot project fracture liaison services represent the best chance we have for getting men and women evaluated and treated for osteoporosis he says,1
diseases like alzheimer s start years even decades before the first symptoms of memory loss shows up and with rates of those diseases rising experts say that more primary care physicians not neurology experts will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available if we had a simple blood test a cholesterol test for alzheimer s disease that would help says dr ronald petersen director of the alzheimer s disease research center at the mayo clinic but we don t but petersen has a potential solution and according to a new paper released wednesday in the journal neurology his alzheimer s test has promise petersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician even those without special training in the brain what we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues he says in the first phase of the test his researchers simply collected information from patients medical charts their age family history of alzheimer s factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to alzheimer s and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory in the next phase they studied the results of the patient s basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation because depression and anxiety have been connected to alzheimer s and another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease how quickly the participant could walk a short distance we were a little surprised says petersen but what s nice about it is that it s a nice non cognitive motor factor so it s looking at another aspect of brain function more this alzheimer s breakthrough could be a game changer petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age that way they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age only if they show such changes a slower walk for example or worsening signs of depression or memory issues should they move on to the third phase of the test which is a blood analysis that would look for known genetic factors linked to alzheimer s including the presence of certain versions of the apoe gene currently the only way to truly separate out those on the road to alzheimer s is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain or to do a spinal tap an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease we have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it s not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint says petersen get the brief sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now choose your country united states of america

photo phys ed gretchen reynolds on the science of fitness an easy two minute vision test administered on the sidelines after a young athlete has hit his or her head can help to reliably determine whether the athlete has sustained a concussion according to a new study of student athletes some as young as the test is so simple and inexpensive that any coach or parent potentially could administer it the study s authors believe and any league afford to provide it as a way to help evaluate and safeguard players those of us who coach or care for young athletes know by now that an athlete who falls or collides with something during play or seems dazed dizzy loses consciousness or complains of head pain should be tested for a concussion which occurs when the brain is physically jostled within the skull but most of us are clueless about how to test young athletes the most commonly recommended sideline test is the standardized assessment of concussion a multipart examination during which athletes are asked to name the date describe how they feel memorize and recall lists of words and do jumping jacks and other tests of coordination ideally this assessment should be administered and evaluated by a medical professional but while the sidelines of college and professional games are crowded with doctors and certified athletic trainers few high schools and youth leagues have those resources most of the time concussion testing in youth sports falls to volunteer coaches or parents with little if any medical experience that situation prompted researchers at new york university s langone concussion center to begin wondering recently whether there might be other easier diagnostic tools to check young players for concussions their thoughts soon turned to vision about percent of the brain s pathways are tied in some to way to vision and visual processing said dr steven galetta chairman of neurology at n y u langone medical center and senior author of the study which was published in the journal of neuro ophthalmology eye tests can tell evaluators a great deal about how well someone s brain is working but for the most part visual tests have not been part of the standard protocol for sideline concussion testing of young athletes however the n y u researchers knew that in recent years trainers working with athletes in sports such as boxing and mixed martial arts where concussions are common had begun supplementing the standardized assessment with a simple vision exam known as the king devick test during which someone reads slightly jumbled lines of numbers printed on three cards as quickly as possible see below for more information the king devick test measures rapid eye movement visual tracking and related cognitive responses and is a reliable indicator of cognitive problems if an injured adult reads the numbers more slowly after a head impact than in baseline testing he or she is considered to have sustained a concussion the test requires no medical training but it had not been evaluated for use in young athletes so the n y u researchers decided to test it they recruited young hockey and lacrosse players between the ages of and and collegians from the same sports these athletes all completed a baseline standardized assessment of concussion exam during preseason and walked as fast as possible along a narrow foot long strip of athletic tape to measure their balance they also completed the king devick test then they went out to play during their subsequent competitive seasons athletes hit their heads and were put through the full battery of sideline concussion tests by parents or coaches under the supervision of n y u medical personnel fourteen age matched uninjured athletes in the same sports completed the same tests to serve as controls neurologists later confirmed that the injured athletes had sustained concussions then the n y u researchers compared how well the various sidelines tests had done at pinpointing the brain injury the standardized assessment of concussion had performed rather miserably correctly identifying only two of the concussed athletes missing and finding that three of the uninjured control athletes had supposedly sustained a concussion since their scores had declined compared with their baseline almost certainly the study s authors believe because these young athletes were physically tired the king devick test did much better correctly assessing concussion in percent of the young injured players and inaccurately identifying it in only one the pace along the tape test was also relatively accurate ten of the injured athletes were slower now but so were five of the unhurt players overall the king devick test had by far the greatest accuracy and lowest risk of false positives the upshot dr galetta believes is that parents and coaches should absolutely consider familiarizing themselves with the king devick test and administering it to young athletes before the season starts then having those baseline numbers and the test itself handy on the sidelines if an athlete hits his or her head and is then slower than baseline by even a fraction of a second at reading off the numbers dr galetta said it is very probable he or she has a concussion and needs to be taken from play and seen by a doctor it is still too early to say however whether the king devick test can replace other more conventional concussion evaluations for young athletes including the standardized assessment despite its shortcomings in this study dr galetta cautioned for now he says it probably should be used in conjunction with other tests how to administer the king devick concussion test photo during preseason use a stopwatch to time the athlete as he or she reads off the numbers on each line from left to right as quickly as possible the cards should be read in order this establishes a baseline time for the greatest precision you might want to have athletes perform the test twice and use their best reading during the season if an athlete is suspected of sustaining a concussion have him or her repeat the test on the sidelines if the time is slower even by a small amount he or she probably has a concussion according to neurologists interestingly uninjured athletes are almost always faster at reading the numbers during games or practices because physical exertion sharpens the kind of visual performance being tested for more fitness food and wellness news like our facebook page,1
cnn by the time cynthia falardeau read about alex pring a little boy who got a battery powered robotic arm last summer she had made peace with her son wyatt s limb difference her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands at a week old doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand they were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die falardeau mourned her boy s missing arm for years but in time embraced her son as he was wyatt also learned to adapt they tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months his main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store falardeau wrote on cnn ireport in truth she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism related delays the limb difference was secondary so when a friend shared a story from the today show with wyatt in mind about a team of university of central florida ucf students and graduates that made an electronic arm for year old pring using a three dimensional printer on campus falardeau was defensive he doesn t need this she thought her fifth grader had a different reaction i want one of these robot arms falardeau remembers wyatt telling her and her husband i could ride a bike i might even be able to paddle a kayak there were other things the year old boy said he would do if he had two hands a proper somersault clap with two hands dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading stuff she hadn t really thought about but he clearly had falardeau got in touch with the orlando students through e nable an online volunteer organization started by rochester institute of technology research scientist jon schull to match people who have d printers with children in need of hands and arms the organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at enablingthefuture org that can be assembled for as little as to middle and high school student groups and girl and boy scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free the ucf team which operates a nonprofit called limbitless solutions is special because it s the only group in the d volunteer network making electronic arms most d arms are mechanical which presents a challenge for children without elbows with mechanical arms the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow the students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep it s really just a step by step process of solving problems the first problem we solved was how do we make the hand move electronically and then how do we attach this arm to a child said sophomore tyler petresky it s just one problem after another we keep solving that s what engineering is all about the centers for disease control and prevention estimates about babies in the united states are born with upper limb deformities each year comprehensive statistics aren t available for the number of children with amputations such as wyatt the ucf project started when albert manero an engineering doctoral student heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the d printed hand he got involved with e nable and met alex a local boy teased because of his missing arm and set about designing a robotic replacement they gave it to alex for free my mother taught us that we re supposed to help change the world manero said at the time we re supposed to help make it better the students were blown away by what happened after that the today show and other national news outlets featured stories about alex and manero and then they got international attention families in more than countries have asked the ucf students to help their children in february microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world each electronic limb takes about to hours to make and assemble the students use the printer in the school s manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials about through donations petresky got involved with the design of pring s hand because manero knew he was good with electronics he bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches i went over to his house and helped him out with electronics he said i found out he was working on an arm and i thought that was the coolest thing in the world eventually manero moved to germany for a fulbright scholarship and left petresky in charge of running the operations in orlando petresky says they ask every family about the child s favorite color superhero and interests so the new limb can not just be a piece of plastic but be a part of them as they ve designed the bionics they ve learned that kids don t necessarily want to blend in children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes disney s frozen and in wyatt s case the blue skinned men from blue man group for christmas the group upgraded alex s plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling optimus prime from transformers we quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal and much more about expressing yourself petresky said there s a large aspect of being artistic and being creative the team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including wyatt he traveled with his mom to ucf last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close he expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month his mom cynthia was most excited about seeing wyatt being celebrated for who he is the adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can t buy he was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself she wrote in her ireport wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children as they got ready to leave the campus her son told her he can t wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm and someday he said he wants to go to ucf and help

colorectal cancers kill more americans than any other cancer except lung cancer but a new study suggests you can reduce your risk of the disease by laying off the cheeseburgers and pastramis and opting for a large salad or broiled salmon instead after tracking americans and canadians for an average of more than seven years researchers from loma linda university found that vegetarians were less likely than meat eaters to be diagnosed with colon cancer or rectal cancer the results were published monday by jama internal medicine the study volunteers were all members of the seventh day adventist church which strongly encourages a vegetarian diet the church also urges followers to exercise regularly and refrain from smoking drinking or using mind altering substances as a result the researchers didn t just compare vegetarians to non vegetarians they were also able to assess the relative merits of different types of vegetarian diets here s how they stacked up advertisement by far the lowest incidence of colorectal cancers was seen in pesco vegetarians people who eat fish at least once a month but eschew all other types of meat compared to omnivores pesco vegetarians were less likely to be diagnosed with these cancers during the course of the study lacto ovo vegetarians who eat eggs and dairy foods but not fish or other meats came in second with an reduced incidence of colorectal cancer they were followed closely by vegans who don t eat eggs dairy products or any kind of meat who were less likely to get a colorectal cancer diagnosis even semi vegetarians who ate meat at least once per month but no more than once per week were less likely to get colorectal cancer during the study period than never vegetarians the researchers found all of these risk reduction calculations were adjusted to account for age gender race education level daily calorie intake exercise habits smoking and drinking behavior family history of colorectal cancer and other medical conditions advertisement the researchers also crunched the numbers separately for colon cancer and rectal cancer in this analysis being a vegetarian of any type reduced the risk of colon cancer more than rectal cancer previous studies have found that eating red meat especially processed meat is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer and eating fiber is known to reduce the risk so it s not exactly surprising that vegetarians fared better than meat eaters in this study but some of the details remain mysterious for instance the vegetarians in this study ate fewer foods with refined grains added fats and sugar than their non vegetarian counterparts the study authors even said it will take more research to determine whether the pesco vegetarians were better off because they ate fish for more medical news follow me on twitter latkarenkaplan and like los angeles times science health on facebook,1
gothenburg sweden reuters a wearable device that stimulates the sense of balance with electric noise could help parkinson s disease patients according to swedish scientists scientists from the university of gothenburg s sahlgrenska academy have developed a portable pocket sized vestibular or balance stimulation device in a bid to improve the lives of parkinson s sufferers the research was led by associate professor filip bergquist who said the simple device was similar to the tens transcutaneous electrical nerve stimulation therapy which is used for pain relief for example in child birth so this is really not a very complicated device it is a current device which is very similar to the ones that people use for pain relief with electrical stimulation of muscles and nerves what s called tens the difference is that we use a particular current profile which you can stimulate the balance organs with without creating a balance disturbance so you do not get the impression that the world is moving or that you are moving you actually do not feel anything bergquist explained the device operates by providing stimulation via patches attached to the patient s head behind the ears where the vestibular system is located parkinson s disease is characterized by reduced levels in the brain of the hormone dopamine a neurotransmitter that allows different regions of the brain to communicate with one another symptoms of advanced parkinson s disease include an impaired sense of balance as well as tremors poor mobility slowness and stiffness nearly all patients diagnosed with the disease are treated with levodopa a drug that stimulates the production of dopamine in the brain the effectiveness of oral levodopa reduces as parkinson s disease progresses in the patient and can lead to involuntary movements or dyskinesia in earlier experiments on rats researchers at sahlgrenska showed that noisy electric stimulation of the balance organs could be used to change the activity of the brain thereby balancing the effects of dopamine shortage and improving the animals motor skills and balance the researchers have also tested the method on ten swedish parkinson s patients in both medicated and unmedicated states according to sahlgrenska on one day the patients received an active noise stimulation and on another day inactive treatment not knowing which day the current was active according to the research institute the experiments showed that the active noise stimulation improved both the patients balance and the combined symptoms parkinson s sufferer staffan lindblom said he did not expect any great advances but would be thankful for anything that would make living with the disease easier i have become hardened in the sense that i do not have too great expectations but i still believe that something will be found at some point which could be useful there is extensive research in this field and i hope that it eventually will come up with a result not a significant result but a few steps forward would really be appreciated he said unfortunately this particular treatment did not work on lindblom with bergquist suspecting there could also be other causes to lindblom s balance problems bergquist said he hoped the device could treat patients for whom the levodopa drug which turns into dopamine in the body and increases levels of the chemical was not enough he also said they were working on the hypothesis that other diseases which affect the dopamine system such as adhd attention deficit hyperactivity disorder could also benefit from this kind of treatment what we are hoping for with this device is to find a treatment for movement disorders where levodopa parkinson s disease where levodopa is not enough and in particular in patients with parkinson s disease where there is problem with gait and balance but this may not be restricted to parkinson s disease so there may be other conditions with poor balance where you could use electrical stimulation of the vestibular organs the balance organs to improve balance and gait he said the plan is now for the device to be tested in a longer term study where patients will be using it at home if those trials prove successful the developers hope the device could be available to the public within five years,1
new research leaves little doubt about it fitness is powerful a new study shows it s also a powerful predictor of whether an individual will live or die in the next decade put a person on a standard issue treadmill crank up the speed and the incline measure the maximum metabolic equivalents of task she achieves and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate she can endure and you have two key bases on which to predict a patient s year survival prospects says a study published monday in the mayo clinic proceedings the resulting fit treadmill score say researchers from johns hopkins university is easily attainable from any standardized exercise test and translates basic treadmill performance measures into a fitness related mortality risk score the predictor also takes into account a patient s age and sex once computed the fit treadmill score was not improved by taking into account a wide range of measures often used to assess risk including blood pressure obesity cholesterol readings family history medication use and the framingham risk score advertisement the study plumbed the records of patients in the detroit area who were referred for a stress test because they reported chest pain shortness of breath palpitations or dizziness among other things researchers checked the medical records for a median of years after each stress test to see if a death of any cause was recorded a total of of these patients who ranged in age from to died looking back at the treadmill performance of those who lived and those who died the researchers generated a scale ranging from to to convey an individual s likelihood of dying of any cause over the next years the notion that being in good physical shape portends lower death risk is by no means new but we wanted to quantify that risk precisely by age gender and fitness level and do so with an elegantly simple equation that requires no additional fancy testing beyond the standard stress test says lead investigator dr haitham ahmed a cardiology fellow at the johns hopkins university school of medicine patients with a score between and have a likelihood of surviving the next decade the researchers said those with scores between and have a probability of survival patients who turn in a performance yielding a score between and have an likelihood of year survival and those with a score between and have a probability of surviving advertisement probabilities may not grab all patients by the collar but telling someone he or she has a better than in chance of dying before the next decade s out or even a better than in chance would probably be a sobering reminder to hit the gym the authors said the metric can be used to communicate fitness related risk and motivate behavioral change after exercise stress testing do it yourself stress testing is probably not very reliable since a physician or sports physiologist needs to be around to decide when to call a halt to the test and therefore what maximum a test taker has achieved but if you think you d like to try and can do a relatively simple computation you can use the metabolic equivalents mets and the percentage of maximum predicted heart rate mphr which are both available on most cardio machines at the gym to calculate your own survival prospects here s the magic formula fit treadmill score mphr mets age if female fat fit flummoxed yeah me too follow me on twitter latmelissahealy and like los angeles times science health on facebook,1
going for a jog on a treadmill can predict how long you re going to live a large new study suggests researchers from johns hopkins medicine looked at standard treadmill stress test results for more than subjects ages to after age and sex the two best predictors of whether the patient would be alive in ten years was how highly activated their metabolism was and how fast their heart would beat during the test metabolism was calculated using metabolic equivalent of tasks or mets a measure of how much energy someone expends during a task the higher met level achieved the more likely it was the subject would last another decade the closer someone came to reaching their maximum heart rate as they ran the less likely they were to die within ten years compared to someone who only reached about percent of their maximum heart rate during the test maximum heart rate was determined by subtracting the subject s age from a formula that s been used for decades by exercisers and doctors alike dr jennifer ashton abc news medical contributor explained the science behind the test on good morning america in medicine we usually base predictions of survival on the absence or presence of a disease state she said what s new here is that there is now a fancy equation doctors can use to compare the chances of survival for one year old woman against another year old woman rather than being viewed as morbid experts should be able to use this information to motivate people to change their behavior ashton said everyone can improve their survival score by exercising more often and pushing it a little harder when they do she added this is in your power to change and improve your numbers you can actually change your own destiny she said,1
staying sexually active and considering sexuality an important part of life may be linked to higher cognitive functioning as people age according to a study in the march issue of the american journal of geriatric psychiatry older men and women who were satisfied with their sexual relationships and considered sexuality an essential component of aging performed better on tests of cognitive function than those who felt sexuality and intimacy were unimportant the research showed previous studies have focused on the prevalence of sexual activity in older people but the influence of cognitive decline on how sexuality is perceived in later life wasn t known researchers said the study conducted in the netherlands involved men and women from a larger study of aging the subjects were years old on average about three quarters had partners researchers assessed cognitive function with tests of memory mental processing speed general cognitive function and fluid intelligence or the ability to reason and think abstractly subjects responded to four questions about the importance of sexuality personally and to older people generally and about their current sex life and need for intimacy and touching with aging chronic diseases depression and medications were recorded a quarter of the subjects rated their current or personal sexuality as important or very important while rated it as unimportant nearly agreed that sexuality at an older age isn t important anymore felt it was important current sexual activity was considered pleasant and unpleasant by and respectively but believed intimacy and touching are still needed in older people while didn t agree subjects who didn t see the importance of sexual behavior or a need for intimacy and who considered their current sexuality unimportant and their sex life unpleasant had lower average cognitive scores compared with those who felt sexuality was important and were satisfied with their current sexual activity the association between lower cognitive functioning and the belief that sexuality was unimportant was significant in both sexes but seemed stronger in women researchers said caveat the study didn t include subjects with severe cognitive impairment causal relation between sexuality and cognitive function couldn t be determined the perception of sexuality in older adults and its relationship with cognitive functioning running injuries regular shoe changes and playing different sports may reduce the risk of injury in recreational runners suggests a study in the current issue of the scandinavian journal of medicine science in sports running involves the repetition of a large number of almost identical movements with very few variations which can lead to overuse injuries researchers said alternating shoes and sports may help to vary the musculoskeletal load the study suggests in researchers in luxembourg recruited recreational runners women and men in their early s for the week study more than half alternated approximately four pairs of running shoes of different makes or models on average while mostly wore the same pair the subjects used an electronic database to record their weekly running and other sports activities including the type of activity duration intensity distance and shoe use pain in the lower back or legs that developed during exercise and prevented normal activity was recorded along with the day the sport was resumed a third of participants reported at least one running related injury during the study most of the injuries affected muscles and tendons and lasted up to a month or longer runners who wore more than one pair of shoes had a lower risk of injury than those who wore the same pair during almost all running sessions the adjusted results showed multiple shoe users wore the main pair of the time during the study period while other runners wore the same shoes of the time runners with multiple shoes participated in other sports for close to two hours a week about twice the amount of time spent by single shoe runners and were more regular in their training and experienced in competitions caveat the study was relatively short which may have limited the number of reported injuries researchers said can parallel use of different running shoes decrease running related injury risk response shift people treated for chronic hand eczema may take a rosier view of the disease after it improves playing down the severity of their worst outbreak a study found this change in perception called a response shift could adversely affect the behaviors patients use to manage the disease according to a report in the march issue of contact dermatitis a response shift is particularly important in clinical studies as it may result in flawed reporting of treatment effects the study said taking regular photographs of skin areas affected by eczema could help counteract a response shift by patients researchers suggest eczema affects an estimated of u s adults according to the national eczema association a nonprofit research organization hand eczema is a fluctuating disease that has been shown to seriously affect patients quality of life the study said researchers in denmark recruited patients with hand eczema women and men ages to quality of life and eczema severity were assessed with two questionnaires six months apart subjects rated the severity of their current eczema and their worst outbreak on a scale from none to extremely bad at both time points close to two thirds rated their current eczema lower on the second assessment at on average compared with on the first assessment indicating an improvement researchers said eczema was unchanged or worse in but of subjects rated their worst ever eczema outbreak at on average at the second assessment and on the first a statistically significant change that indicated a response shift researchers said caveat the six month follow up period was relatively short researchers said response shift in severity assessment of hand eczema with visual analogue scales,1
en español by alan mozes healthday reporter sunday march healthday news a procedure that delivers the anesthetic lidocaine xylocaine directly to nerves in the back of the nasal cavity appears to offer significant relief to migraine sufferers preliminary research indicates early findings suggest that a single outpatient treatment can reduce migraine pain levels by about percent for up to a month after the procedure according to this small ongoing study the technique is a minimally invasive treatment option said the study s lead author dr kenneth mandato a vascular and interventional radiologist at albany medical center in albany n y he added that he views the new procedure as a clear simple alternative to standard migraine treatments this nasal spray option is safe convenient and innovative said mandato in the new study his team focused on patients averaging about years of age all had been diagnosed with either migraines or another type of intensely painful and cyclically occurring headache known as cluster headaches before participating in the study patients were asked to indicate their pain levels according to a standardized scale from to pre treatment pain scores averaged more than mandato said the participants all underwent a session of image guided therapy in which a spaghetti sized catheter was inserted through a nostril and into the nasal passage to deliver a dose of lidocaine to a nerve center known as the sphenopalatine ganglion this was then repeated in the opposite nostril according to the researchers mandato stressed that no one in the study required sedation to undergo the procedure the target nerve bundle explained mandato resembles a complex highway crossing with many nerve signals and exits going in all directions and he said the hope was that lidocaine would essentially short circuit that bundle s headache causing pathway the day after the procedure average migraine pain levels had dropped from about to just over pain scores rose only marginally a week after the procedure and reached an average of just over by the one month post procedure mark according to the study the procedure didn t help everyone though seven of the patients about percent failed to get any benefit from the treatment the investigators found however percent of those in the study reported needing less standard pain relief medication after the procedure the researchers acknowledged that this procedure is a temporary solution that would need to be repeated mandato said his team is continuing to monitor patients to see how well the nasal spray approach holds up six months out dr richard lipton director of the montefiore headache center in new york city described the findings as very dramatic unmet treatment needs in chronic migraine are huge as is the overuse of medications he noted when a body gets used to having a chronic headache suppressor the patient can experience a rebound in the absence of that suppressor so developing an effective treatment that can reduce the need for acute medicine would be very valuable lipton explained these results sound very promising lipton added of course it remains to be seen if the demonstrated benefit already seen holds up over a longer period of time and with a bigger group of patients mandato and colleagues are scheduled to present their findings sunday at the society of interventional radiology annual meeting in atlanta findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they ve been published in a peer reviewed journal the study received no funding from private industry more information there s more on migraine treatment at the u s national institute of neurological disorders and stroke,1
by maureen salamon healthday reporter wednesday feb healthday news after undergoing weight loss surgery women are significantly less prone to diabetes during pregnancy but twice as likely to deliver smaller than normal infants a new study suggests swedish scientists found that weight loss or bariatric surgery before pregnancy lowers the chances of certain complications for mothers and babies but raises the odds for others they recommended any pregnancy after weight loss surgery be considered high risk and receive stricter monitoring the number of women who are obese in early pregnancy has increased dramatically over the last decades said study author kari johansson a postdoctoral researcher and nutritionist at karolinska institute in stockholm consequently there has been a dramatic rise in the number of women becoming pregnant after bariatric surgery she added the positive effects of bariatric surgery on health outcomes such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease are reasonably well studied but less is known about the effects on pregnancy and post delivery outcomes johansson pointed out the study was published online feb in the new england journal of medicine u s health officials say more than one third of american adults are obese with a body mass index bmi a height weight calculation of or higher nearly obese people underwent weight loss surgery in the united states in according to the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery while various techniques may be used the surgery restricts the amount of food the stomach can hold and or reduces the intestines absorption of calories and nutrients from food johansson and her colleagues used data from nationwide swedish health registries to compare pregnancies between nearly women who had given birth after bariatric surgery and more than women who hadn t had the surgery but had the same bmi only percent of women who had weight loss surgery developed gestational diabetes compared to percent of the other group the researchers said the surgical group was also much less likely to give birth to larger than normal babies however the weight loss surgery group was twice as likely to give birth to babies considered small for their gestational age and their pregnancies were also of slightly shorter duration additionally the surgical group experienced a slight bump in the rate of stillbirths the study found the investigators didn t examine what might have caused smaller babies among bariatric surgery recipients or higher stillbirths but johannson said those outcomes might be due to reduced nutrient absorption resulting from the surgery with a fetus not receiving sufficient nutrition it has been reported that gastric bypass a form of bariatric surgery increases the risk of protein iron vitamin b vitamin d and calcium deficiencies she said also many women in our study may have been continuing to lose weight when they became pregnant continued weight loss may affect fetal nutrition and could influence growth because obesity is linked to poor outcomes for expectant mothers and babies including birth defects gestational diabetes high blood pressure premature birth and even childhood obesity efforts to lose weight before pregnancy are important said dr aaron caughey chair of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at oregon health and science university s school of medicine but caughey who wrote an editorial accompanying the new research said women considering weight loss surgery should make the decision based on the long term health benefits of the procedure not on potential pregnancy related benefits i don t think pregnancy should be the thing that tips the scale said caughey i don t think the evidence from this study is enough to say now that you should absolutely get this surgery so you have a better pregnancy outcome caughey agreed with the researchers that any pregnancy occurring after weight loss surgery merits a higher level of monitoring and should be considered high risk he also noted that some experts advise women who undergo weight loss surgery before pregnancy to delay conceiving until to months after the procedure the period when the most rapid weight loss occurs i think a conversation with someone who takes care of complicated pregnancies a maternal fetal medicine doctor is a good idea caughey said more information the american society for metabolic and bariatric surgery offers more about weight loss surgery,1

for those plagued with peanut allergies protection may eventually come in the form of a patch worn on the skin a new study suggests saul loeb afp getty images in the second phase of a drug trial half of participants wearing the highest dose peanut patches for a year were able to consume the equivalent of four peanuts without reacting researchers reported sunday at the annual meeting of the american academy of allergy asthma and immunology it means that they are not going to have to worry about traces of peanut in a package that came from a plant where peanuts were used or minor contamination of food in a restaurant said the study s lead author dr hugh sampson a professor of pediatrics at the icahn school of medicine and director of the jaffe food allergy institute at mount sinai that s a potentially life saving development consuming even trace amounts of a food allergen can cause a reaction about million americans have food allergies including in children according to the food allergy research and education fare group eight foods account for percent of all reactions milk eggs peanuts tree nuts soy wheat fish and shellfish trending stories celebrity news and all the best of today this site is protected by recaptcha privacy policy terms of service unlabeled allergens are a leading cause of food recalls in the u s and the number of food allergy related visits to hospitals are on the rise according to the food and drug administration the fda recently warned people with peanut allergies to avoid foods containing ground cumin after traces of peanut powder were found in the ground spice in the skin patch trial the international team of researchers randomly assigned volunteers ages to to wear a placebo patch or a patch containing peanut protein at one of three doses micrograms micrograms or micrograms at the end of a year percent of those wearing the high dose microgram patch were able to tolerate consuming at least one gram of peanut protein the same dose worked for nearly percent of kids to the skin patch intended to desensitize patients to peanuts by exposing them to tiny amounts of the allergen may be particularly appealing to children who are too frightened to try oral or under the tongue therapy many have been told all their lives that if they ingest peanuts they will have a severe reaction and die he said so it s tough to get them to take it with this you just slap a little patch on their backs although some volunteers experienced redness and itchiness at the site of the patch there were no serious side effects just two dropped out because of flare ups of eczema the goal for most practicing allergists and for most parents is to get a child to the point where if there is an accidental ingestion of peanut it would not be as risky or life threatening said dr amy stallings an assistant professor of pediatrics in the division of allergy and immunology at the duke university medical center who is not affiliated with the new study and the patch may be a way of doing this that is safer the patch study s results are promising although researchers need to continue following the participants for another year sampson said it could be several more years before the patch will be available for consumers researchers are trying to discover why food allergies have increased among children the number of kids living with peanut or tree nut allergies tripled between and studies show but there s no clear answer allergies to peanuts and tree nuts tend to begin in childhood and are usually lifelong,1
surgeons sometimes fly blind when operating on hard to reach anatomical parts or hard to see conditions for visual references inside the brain or body they often rely on images and scans taken before an operation a growing number of hospitals are equipping operating suites with magnetic resonance imaging ct scanners and other technology that enables surgeons to scan a patient in real time without having to move them from the operating table the resulting real time d visuals known as intraoperative imaging help surgeons excise tumors and tissue with greater accuracy reducing risks such as nicked nerves from an errant knife and the potential need for repeat surgery the images also help surgeons spot bleeding blood clots or other unexpected complications outside their field of vision intraoperative imaging allows surgeons to perform significantly better than conventional surgery says sohail mirza medical director of the center for surgical innovation and chairman of orthopedics at the dartmouth hitchcock health system in lebanon n h affiliated with dartmouth college s medical school we still need a surgeon s training and judgment dr mirza says but we can use three dimensional deep imaging to get past the limitations of human error and hand eye coordination dartmouth hitchcock opened the million center last year with financing from a national institutes of health grant and its own funds mri and ct scanners mounted on ceiling rails slide in and out of four sterile operating and procedure rooms the technology first developed for use in complex brain surgeries now is expanding for use in spinal cord surgery biopsies and removal of tumors and lesions in the breast lung prostate liver pancreas and kidneys researchers are studying other ways the technology can help diagnose and treat cancer and other diseases doctors used real time mri and ct scan images to remove a complicated tumor last year from the spine of jack deliso center with him are his parents lisa and michael and sisters chloe left and rigney photo michael deliso the real time scans can show surgeons whether tissue or organs have shifted during an operation and where the border of a lesion ends and healthy tissue begins in radiation treatment doctors using the scans can see when a tumor shifts and pause to spare healthy tissue the images can also provide better visualization of masses that are completely out of sight studies have found that in of cases brain surgeons will modify what they are doing based on an intraoperative mri scan this is precision medicine at its best using an individual patient s images to guide their procedure says clare tempany co director of the advanced multimodality image guided operating suite program known as amigo at brigham and women s hospital in boston the program is part of the hospital s federally funded national center for image guided therapy which is researching the use of intraoperative imaging in a variety of procedures and treatments including its cost effectiveness since amigo opened in patients have undergone surgery including lung biopsies and breast conserving tumor removal the need for more accuracy is real as many as of women who have breast conserving surgery known as lumpectomy followed by radiation need a second operation because positive cells remain at brigham and women s researchers are looking at how to improve surgeons ability to determine the exact margins of tumors using intraoperative mri followed by chemical analysis to decrease the need for re operations dr mirza says in the past during spine surgeries if he became concerned about whether screws or implants were perfectly placed he would close up an incision and wheel his patient two floors down for a scan in some cases he would bring the patient back to revise the surgery or in other cases accept slightly imperfect results to avoid more cutting revisions in addition to adding to the patient s risks use up costly operating room and staff time he says last fall jack deliso then needed surgery to remove a painful mass wrapped around his lower spine that made it increasingly hard for him to walk an initial biopsy to test for malignancy had been inconclusive dr mirza and a pediatric neurosurgeon david bauer proposed cutting out the entire tumor in one procedure jack s parents michael and lisa deliso were fearful that if nerves were damaged during surgery his ability to walk as well as his bladder and bowel function could be impaired the technology was reassuring they explained to us that they were able to take the pictures with the mri while they were operating to make sure they got everything without having to damage nerves or disturb the tumor mr deliso says jack says he was calm going into surgery because it just had to be done and there was no use being scared of it he was tired of lying awake at night when he says he felt excruciating pain during the hour procedure surgeons could see only the back of jack s spine because they didn t know if the tumor was malignant they were determined to avoid cutting into it which could spread potentially cancerous cells elsewhere in the body as they drilled into bones to detach and remove the tumor they used a ct scan of the spine to help navigate accurately and avoid removing bone that wasn t directly involved next they performed an mri to make sure the nerve roots were unscathed and they hadn t missed any part of the mass toward the end of the procedure they did a second ct scan which showed there was enough bone left so jack wouldn t need reconstruction with rods screws and bone grafts they finished up and closed the incision jack was in the hospital for three nights a week later pathology tests came back showing the tumor had been benign and the surgeons had gotten all of it now years old jack says he would like to play soccer or football and be an orthopedic surgeon when he grows up intraoperative scanning is costly for hospitals for example imris inc of canada makes visius surgical theatre systems found in operating rooms world wide including at brigham and women s and at dartmouth each system consists of a two or three room suite with mri units costing from about million to million and ct scanners ranging from about million to million jay miller president and chief executive says over procedures have been performed to date with imris systems intraoperative imaging has its own risks says bernadette henrichs director of the nurse anesthesia program at barnes jewish college and nurse anesthesia research and education at washington university school of medicine both in st louis because of the strong magnetic force used in mri ferrous metal objects and tools must be kept out of the operating room along with pagers cellphones jewelry and hair pins anesthesia teams stay with patients during scans and use equipment such as aluminum oxygen tanks and instruments made from plastic titanium and other materials compatible with mri at barnes jewish hospital or teams get training before they can work with live mri imaging they do annual safety drills including emergency procedures in the event a patient has a cardiac arrest while undergoing a scan these are exciting advances but we have to be vigilant in making sure patients and health care workers aren t harmed and take necessary safety

it s hard to talk about carbs without talking about wheat and it s hard to talk about wheat without talking about gluten gluten is not a carbohydrate it s a mix of proteins found in wheat and its close relatives including spelt kamut and farro as well as in barley and rye it s what gives bread its elasticity but it also sets off the immune system of people with celiac disease damaging the small intestine and sometimes producing painful and unpleasant symptoms even some people who don t have celiac disease feel better when they don t eat wheat they may assume that they have gluten sensitivity but some researchers believe that it s not the gluten they re sensitive to instead it s fermentable oligosaccharides disaccharides monosaccharides and polyols or fodmaps never was a group of molecules more desperately in need of an acronym fodmaps are a group of carbohydrates that don t get broken down and absorbed in the small intestine instead they pass through to the large intestine where they draw water into the gut and start to ferment the process by which fodmaps are broken down and fermented can cause gastrointestinal distress diarrhea bloating pain flatulence and constipation wheat and rye are high in fodmaps as are onions garlic apples stone fruit pistachios and many other foods research by peter gibson a professor of gastroenterology at australia s monash university has found that some people who believed they were gluten sensitive were instead fodmap sensitive a low fodmap diet eased their symptoms as it does for about percent of people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome a condition that causes abdominal pain and bowel changes gibson estimates that overall about percent of the population may be fodmap sensitive but there s a problem with a low fodmap diet the fermentation that is painful to that percent is good for your gut because it stimulates growth of the kind of bacteria associated with digestive health following strictly the low fodmap diet is associated with changes in the microbiota that many would not equate with good health says gibson who stresses that a low fodmap diet should be used to reduce specific symptoms not as a way to improve health if your gut can handle fodmaps foods that contain a lot of them can be very good choices partly because the fermentation helps your gut biome and partly because the way fodmaps are digested means you re absorbing fewer calories than indicated on a fodmap rich product s label unless you have specific symptoms that a low fodmap diet alleviates gibson says enjoy your fodmaps food list high fodmaps protein legumes low fodmaps protein meat fish chicken tofu high fodmaps vegetables garlic onions asparagus artichokes sugar snap peas celery sweet corn low fodmaps vegetables green beans carrots cucumbers lettuce tomatoes zucchini high fodmaps fruit and nuts apples mangoes pears peaches plums watermelon cashews pistachios low fodmaps fruit and nuts bananas oranges grapes almonds high fodmaps cereals grains breads pastas wheat products barley rye low fodmaps cereals grains breads and pastas gluten free bread and pastas oats rice quinoa high fodmaps dairy products soft cheeses cow s milk cream ice cream yogurt low fodmaps dairy products lactose free milk and yogurt hard cheese,1
an ancient herbal remedy is getting fresh attention this cold and flu season some parents and even pediatricians believe elderberry extract or syrup can help kids stay healthy and lessen the symptoms when they do get sick the brennan family in glen rock new jersey believes it works so we give the kids and we take it ourselves elderberry every morning right after breakfast kevin brennan told cbs news he whips up a homemade concoction using frozen elderberries blueberries and honey some medical research suggests elderberry may reduce swelling in the mucous membranes to help relieve congestion the brennans pediatrician dr lawrence rosen explains elderberry contains chemicals which are flavonoids which are anti inflammatory agents raw elderberry is poisonous istockphoto one small study found an elderberry extract called sambucol could shorten the duration of flu symptoms after a person gets sick by about days that would be similar to prescription antiviral medications like tamiflu or relenza which have been proven effective in much larger studies and approved by the fda to shorten the duration of the flu there is not enough research about whether elderberry works in children and there is also isn t enough information about the proper dose in children dr anna minta of johns hopkins children s center told cbs news before you start popping elderberries beware eating them raw can make you sick the university of maryland medical center says european elder also called black elder is the variety most often used for medicinal purposes raw or unripe elderberries as well as other parts of the plant contain a toxic compound related to cyanide if the berries are not cooked thoroughly they can be poisonous but kevin brennan says for his family the natural alternative seems to be working the duration and the severity of how they get sick is much less and they get healthy quicker he said,1

two highly effective contraceptives the intrauterine device iud and the implant actually last much longer than they are currently recommended according to new research in a new study published in the journal obstetrics gynecology researchers discovered that the hormonal iud and the implant are highly effective a year after they are currently approved for use more the iud answer why the best form of birth control is the one no one uses the researchers followed women who were using an implant like implanon and nexplanon and women using the mirena hormonal iud the implants are currently approved for three years and the hormonal iud used in the study is approved for five there is also a non hormonal iud that is approved for years but it was not included in the current study all the women were between the ages of and and their contraceptives were within six months of expiring before they enrolled in the study the women were informed of the pregnancy risk associated with using their device longer than recommended and the researchers called them for followup every months for months or until the women had their device removed by the end of the trial period none of the women using the implant were pregnant and there was one pregnancy among the women using the iud still the failure rate was similar to the failure rate of the iud when used during the five year period which is under the study is still ongoing and the researchers plan to recruit up to women and ultimately test whether the iuds and implants were effective for up to three years after their current fda approved duration the benefit of being able to use the implant and iud for a longer period of time is that it could reduce costs for individuals and insurance the longer use also makes the iud and implant more convenient for women since maintenance is reduced though the data is preliminary the researchers say they believe that the hormonal iud and the implant can both be used for an additional year longer than the fda recommends that doesn t mean you should extend your own use of the contraceptives without talking to your doctor the study is still continuing and it could be quite a long time before any changes to clinical recommendations are considered contact us at,1
as a young girl rachel brathen lived with crippling back pain born with scoliosis a curvature of the spine she was later in a car accident then a white water rafting accident that made her back problems worse i had so much pain that i would wake up and reach my arm out to touch my alarm and something would just snap the year old who now lives in aruba said when she was a teen doctors recommended surgery to straighten her spine both her aunt and grandmother also were diagnosed with scoliosis her aunt opted for the back surgery which helped alleviate pain but also left her with very limited movement in her spine then a friend suggested brathen try yoga she decided to try a few classes before undergoing the knife more than million people practice yoga in the united states according to the sporting goods manufacturers association many of them practice to improve flexibility and find pain relief according to the yoga journal but as dr richard besser abc news chief health and medical editor noted it s difficult to pin down whether yoga is effective at easing symptoms of those who have back pain there are many types of yoga and so many different causes of back pain he said despite the lack of conclusive research besser said there is some recent evidence to suggest that people with chronic low back pain who do a carefully adapted set of yoga poses may experience less pain and improve their ability to walk and move ben kane in one randomized controlled trial published in the annals of internal medicine back pain patients who learned yoga had better back function and were better able to manage their pain another study in the same journal showed that yoga improved disability from chronic back pain more than exercise or self care instructions there is also a close relationship between yoga and stress so taking yoga might reduce stress and in turn provide some relief to someone with a tense achy back noted dr amit sood professor of medicine at the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota but as good as yoga may be for soothing stress and a sore back sood recommended getting medical clearance first and taking it slow and easy to start that s exactly what brathen did she started with gentle restorative classes that focused on improving the core strength of her middle muscles little by little she noticed the pain was less intense and less frequent she said it took years to move from a slow meditative practice to more rigorous poses today she is not only nearly pain free she is able to do advanced moves like handstands and acrobatic arm balances brathen said she is so grateful for her yoga practice she became an instructor now she travels the world teaching yoga and sharing her story she started a social media challenge with the hashtag yogaeverydamnday that has million fans on instagram but she said yoga has done more for her than just heal her lower back yoga helps with a feeling of well being on so many levels she said the world could benefit more from people with flexible hearts than flexible bodies ben kane tweet chat on the health benefits of yoga today at pm et has your mind body and spirit been helped in some way by yoga join our tweet chat today on the health benefits of yoga at p m et and share your story dr richard besser abc news chief health and medical editor will moderate joining is easy here s how additional reporting by abc news liz neporent,1
jenny chang buzzfeed rachel george was used to being sick a genetic condition left her with intellectual disabilities and a weak immune system by she had endured dozens of bacterial infections kidney ear sinus heart bone and more and taken hundreds of antibiotic pills but when she entered the harborview hospital in seattle for a foot operation her body s defenses were pushed to a new limit hospitals are hotbeds for nasty and sometimes deadly infections after her surgery rachel s lungs picked up two methicillin resistant staphylococcus aureus mrsa and pseudomonas aeruginosa both bugs are part of a growing category of bacterial infections that don t respond to traditional antibiotics rachel was supposed to be in the hospital for five days she stayed nine weeks she developed pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome and was put on a ventilator with a tube down her throat when her doctors finally released her they told her mother she had three years to live at most before the bugs won three years later in january rachel was indeed close to death she was spending half of every month in intensive care the other half at home an iv constantly dripping into her bloodstream by then she had cycled through more than a dozen powerful antibiotics each time the doctors would give her a new drug then watch helplessly as the bacteria overpowered it every time we took her back to the hospital it was a question of whether or not this was going to be it her mother rose george told buzzfeed news one day the nurse on duty asked rose if she d ever considered phage therapy rose had never heard of it and that s unsurprising the therapy which uses specialized viruses called bacteriophages to kill bacteria is only available in a handful of former soviet countries rose asked her daughter s doctor but she d never heard of phage either soon rose was on the phone with doctors at a small clinic in tbilisi in the republic of georgia ordering glass vials of viruses at a pop she s one of at least people desperate enough to try this little known viral therapy from eastern europe it s an extreme solution to what may be this century s biggest medical crisis the death of antibiotics since the discovery of penicillin in scientists have amassed a medical arsenal of more than antibiotics the drugs have prevented soldiers from losing limbs and mothers from dying during childbirth with access to antibiotics parents no longer worry about losing their kid to an ear infection or bad scrape but now antibiotics are everywhere not just in orange pill bottles but in the food given to pigs cattle and chicken and the more the bugs interact with antibiotics the quicker they evolve defense mechanisms at least strains of bacteria have evolved into superbugs becoming resistant to most of our drugs and pharmaceutical companies more interested in profitable blockbusters like viagra and zoloft haven t developed a new class of antibiotics in years we re dying because of it more than people in the u s die each year from antibiotic resistant infections by an estimated million people worldwide will die by superbug after two decades of warnings from the scientific community the problem is finally getting serious attention in his budget proposal released today u s president obama threw billion at tackling the antibiotic resistance crisis nearly double the amount allocated last year if approved by congress this money will go toward screening soil samples for new antibiotics reducing the drugs in livestock feed boosting hospital surveillance and perhaps making phage therapy a viable option in the u s phages are bacteria s natural enemies they work by injecting their dna inside bacterial cells where they replicate wildly produce new phages and eventually cause the bacteria to rupture releasing even more viruses to hunt for bacterial prey phages power comes from two places they are the most common and diverse organisms on earth and each phage harms only specific strains of bacteria when you turn on the faucet millions of phages flow out with your tap water that leaves a nearly inexhaustible supply of potential agents to use in the fight against infection doctors have been using phages to kill bacteria for nearly a century just not in the u s in a georgian doctor named george eliava set up the first phage therapy clinic the eliava institute in tbilisi antibiotics hadn t been discovered yet so phages were a revolutionary weapon against all kinds of infections ryland young head of the center for phage technology at texas a m university told buzzfeed news it was kind of pre scientific no one knew what these phages were except that they worked five years later penicillin came along effective cheap and quick to produce in large quantities doctors in the u s u k and france quickly seized upon the miracle drug as a key to winning world war ii that also meant keeping this weapon away from the soviets with no access to antibiotics scientists behind the iron curtain bolstered their use of phages instead at its very peak when they were supplying the russian army the eliava institute was producing two to three tons of phages per day zamphira alavidze a microbiologist in tbilisi who worked at the eliava institute for years told buzzfeed news but after the fall of the soviet union eliava s phage production dropped significantly and it downsized into a small research center today georgian doctors frequently use antibiotics to treat infections but often in combination with phages every clinic everywhere in georgia everybody uses the phages alavidze said the last decade she added has brought another big change two small phage clinics in tbilisi have sprung up to cater specifically to the boom of international patients like rachel ten or fifteen years ago nobody believed the phages would be so popular they thought we were crazy alavidze said now it s not too easy to come to georgia but we try to help somehow because sometimes nothing else works randy wolcott a wound care doctor in lubbock texas first went to tbilisi in he was fed up with the lack of options for his patients with drug resistant infections and wanted to investigate phages as a treatment of last resort wolcott spent a week at the eliava institute it looked nothing like the gleaming and sterile high rises of most u s hospitals the building was small some of the equipment looked ancient and the walls were unpainted but after observing the georgian clinicians at work wolcott was sold he walked into a city pharmacy and bought hundreds of vials of phages concocted for wound infections they were very cheap and i bought them by the case wolcott told buzzfeed news the only hiccup came when explaining his viral cargo to u s customs officials it can cause some problems when our government hears that you re bringing viruses back from a former soviet country wolcott said chuckling it s hard to explain it s a virus but it s a virus only for bacteria not for us phages aren t approved for use in the u s so once back in lubbock wolcott wrote to the texas board of medicine and asked for permission to use the viruses on his wound patients the board decided that because these patients had exhausted all other options wolcott would be allowed to use the experimental treatment in a legal arrangement known as compassionate use wolcott s patients saw improvement within days in of the cases the patients wounds healed enough to save their limbs he treated hundreds of patients using the original batch of phages he brought over from tbilisi five years ago he went back for more wolcott usually uses the phages in combination with traditional antibiotics but he says he couldn t have offered the same quality of treatment without the viruses someone needs to do this in america wolcott said to have a bank of stuff that we can turn to for these chronic infections that would be huge until that happens though patients are looking abroad rose george s internet search led her to a clinic in tbilisi called the phage therapy center it was set up in by phage international a fledgling medical tourism outfit founded in danville california by a computer scientist named chris smith the center s doctors asked rose to send over a bacterial sample from rachel s lungs over the course of a month rose attempted to send several samples but each was rejected by u s customs rose s son tried driving a sample across the border into canada which led to a seven hour interrogation by canadian agents followed by two more hours with the fbi on the u s side finally smith suggested that rose ambiguously label the package as medical records she did and the shipment slipped through a few weeks later the georgian doctors called rose with good news they would be able to design a concoction of phages to treat rachel s infections after convincing rachel s doctor to write a prescription for the viruses so they could cross the u s border rose paid the georgian clinic for a three month supply she was surprised that phages were so inexpensive in contrast her insurance company was forking over roughly a month for rachel s antibiotics a couple of weeks later boxes filled with vials of phages landed on the georges doorstep rose used a nebulizer to administer the phages twice a day so that rachel could breathe the liquids into her lungs within three weeks rachel s mrsa the same infection she d been fighting with antibiotics for three years disappeared it hasn t returned in the five years since advocates of phage therapy see it as a powerful new weapon in the war we re quickly losing against bacterial infection but phages are certainly not a cure all just ask roger mintey a year old retired accountant from the sleepy english town of reigate in mintey caught a severe sinus infection that left him with a near constant cold he s had it on and off ever since in the first decade of fighting his illness mintey sought help at five english hospitals underwent two surgeries and took more than two dozen courses of antibiotics nothing worked in he heard about phage therapy from his cousin s wife who d gone to tbilisi to treat a chronic bladder infection she pointed roger to phage international the same company that helped rose george get her daughter s phages the georgian doctors affiliated with the company said they could treat his sinus infection so mintey cut phage international a check for and sent a sample of his nasal discharge to georgia via fedex then accompanied by a friend he boarded his first ever plane to fly to the company s phage therapy center they landed in tbilisi at a m and were met by someone from the clinic who escorted them to their hotel mintey was instructed to drink a phage preparation three times a day from his hotel room every couple of days he would go into the clinic for additional phage treatments the clinic was inside a nondescript building set up something like an indoor mall you went through a set of double doors passed by a suntanning place and there you were one office two treatment rooms and that was it mintey told buzzfeed news a doctor and two nurses had him sit on a cushioned patient s chair they tipped the chair back so his nostrils faced up and poured the phage liquid into his nose he was instructed to say the word cuckoo as the phages slowly slid into all of his sinuses seeping out from his nasal passages into his forehead and cheekbones his nose started bleeding but the clinicians told him it was nothing to worry about they also gave him a shot of manuka honey extract in his butt telling him it had antimicrobial properties it was all quite uncomfortable mintey said after two weeks mintey flew back to england three days later his infection was back i realized the entire treatment had done absolutely nothing he said mintey claims to have called emailed faxed and sent physical letters to his doctors in georgia and to phage international s headquarters in california he heard nothing back smith of phage international claims that emails sent to roger at the time were bouncing and that he only had mintey s friend s phone number eventually the clinic sent mintey more phages in the mail but the infection persisted he says he has not heard from them since i was very disappointed mintey said by the end of i had given up on phages mintey s situation highlights many of the difficulties surrounding a therapy only accessible through a small and largely unregulated medical tourism industry smith says phage international has served more than patients to date with some registered on its website he wants to open a new phage therapy clinic in trinidad which could be easier for american patients to visit during the past years you d go to an investor or venture capitalist and they d never heard of phage and they didn t want to know about it he said now that s changed nothing about phage international is decidedly illegal i glenn cohen a law professor at harvard s petrie flom center for health law policy biotechnology and bioethics told buzzfeed news but there are many ethical issues at play what happens when something goes wrong or as in roger s case when a patient feels like he s not getting what he paid for who do you go after where do you do it cohen said that s where things get more tricky,1
leonard guarente one of the best known antiaging researchers in the region and the roster of eminent scientists have formed elysium health which on tuesday will debut its first product a pill called basis they say it will enable the body to produce more of a natural compound that supports a healthy metabolism a leading biologist at the massachusetts institute of technology with backing from five scientists who are nobel prize recipients is wading into the murky world of dietary supplements with a new antiaging pill that is said to restore muscle tissue improve brain function and increase energy levels by improving metabolic health advertisement many products in the supplement business are launched with questionable science but elysium said studies in mice show a clear connection between increased levels of this compound called nad and improved health in older mice there have been a lot of new findings in the past five years identifying some extremely promising compounds that promote wellness and health we want to make them available for people to improve their health before they get sick said guarente an elysium health founder and its chief scientific officer we are filling a space by combining natural compounds with scientific validation the active ingredients in basis are nicotinamide riboside a substance that makes nad and is found in traces in many foods such as milk and pterostilbene an antioxidant found in blueberries both substances are available individually as dietary supplements at a recommended dose of two gel caps daily a month s supply of basis will cost with a membership and will be available online only the company s chief executive is eric marcotulli previously a partner at the silicon valley venture firm sequoia capital among the scientific heavyweights advising elysium health are martin karplus emeritus professor of chemistry at harvard and a nobel laureate tom sudhof a stanford school of medicine professor who received a nobel in eric kandel a biochemist and biophysicist at columbia university and a nobel laureate aaron ciechanover distinguished research professor at technion israel institute of technology and a nobel recipient and jack szostak a professor of genetics at harvard medical school who received a nobel in advertisement szostak said his role at elysium health is to scour scientific literature for new natural compounds that are shown to improve health and bring them to the company s attention as potential ingredients in new products what interests me in this is that it is a different challenge to apply what we are learning through basic research not just to curing disease but to keeping people healthy said szostak who runs a research lab at massachusetts general hospital if you go to whole foods or cvs you see miles of dietary supplements and vitamins most of them have no scientific basis and you don t know what you are getting guarente was involved in several other efforts to develop antiaging medicines that did not pan out he was a founder of elixir pharmaceuticals and then became involved with sirtris pharmaceuticals which conducted research into the potential antiaging properties of a chemical found in red wine with elysium guarente and his colleagues are entering an industry with a mixed reputation at billion annually and growing vitamins and supplements are hugely popular among consumers but the business has often been criticized by mainstream medicine for making ambitious claims about quick cures and miraculous health improvements that are not subjected to rigorous scientific scrutiny advertisement if elysium health were developing basis as a drug it would have to conduct clinical trials with humans to prove that it works and the food and drug administration would have to sign off on its scientific evidence before it could be sold as medicine but as a supplement basis and similar products only have to be shown to be safe for humans to take with labels that are not misleading with basis for example there is no scientific evidence yet that the pill would produce the same beneficial effect in humans as in mice indeed one scientist not involved with elysium questions the company s marketing pitch saying there is too little information to know what basis can do it is not quite clear to me what they want to target with this pill said pere puigserver a biology professor at harvard medical school what does it mean to improve metabolic health and what exactly is being repaired in the body and is the outcome the same for everyone puigserver who runs a cancer biology lab at dana farber cancer institute noted that addressing health and aging through metabolism involves a complex web of pathways and mechanisms we need more information on how this works precisely in people before we can advise them to take anything he said guarente pledged that elysium health would be unlike most other companies in the business it is conducting studies of its pill in humans and will release the results advertisement as soon as we have analyzed the data we will publish them on our website he said one of the venture capitalists backing elysium health acknowledged that skepticism is among the company s greater challenges this space is traditionally driven by marketing language said kal vapuri whose new york firm trisiras group is one of elysium s initial funders but we will be data driven and will communicate the complexities of science in simple ways stefanie friedhoff can be reached at stefanie friedhoff globe com

reuters health adding spice in the form of curcumin supplements to the daily diets of people with risk factors for heart disease may lower inflammation a new study suggests inflammation is implicated in a wide range of illnesses from heart disease to cancer and joint pain in the eight week trial researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation such as c reactive protein and other blood markers curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the asian countries said the study s senior author amirhossein sahebkar two key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties said sahebkar researcher at the mashhad university of medical sciences in iran in an email these properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies he noted but there have been relatively few studies in people so his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome a cluster of risk factors for heart disease having a large waistline high blood pressure high blood sugar low levels of hdl good cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome people with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome sahebkar s team writes in the journal clinical nutrition they set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study half were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside all the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks at the beginning of the study and again at the end the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation including c reactive protein crp which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk they found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin a c a measure of long term blood sugar levels the comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers and no changes in the other markers the study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of crp concentrations in a total of patients the findings of our studies along with clinical findings reported by other groups indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases sahebkar said the researchers didn t examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases and it was a fairly brief study so it s not clear what the long term implications may be they caution in their report the study was funded by the clinical trial research center in tehran and the iran national science foundation one of the authors is ceo of sabinsa corporation and sami labs ltd manufacturers of curcumin supplements sahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician curcumin is a very safe natural supplement and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use even at high doses sahebkar said however owing to limited safety information pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement sahebkar said in addition patients with malabsorption syndrome gall bladder problems gastric ulcer bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement sahebkar said sahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements whilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin he said sahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin usually less than percent and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally source bit ly swsz y clinical nutrition online january,1

take a deep breath and relax behind that common piece of advice is a complex series of physiological processes that calm the body slow the heart and help control pain breathing and controlling your breath is one of the easiest ways to improve mental and physical health doctors and psychologists say slow deep and consistent breathing has been shown to have benefits in treating conditions ranging from migraines and irritable bowel syndrome to anxiety disorders and pain if you train yourself to breathe a little bit slower it can have long term health benefits said murali doraiswamy a professor of psychiatry at duke university medical center in durham n c deep breathing activates a relaxation response he said potentially decreasing inflammation improving heart health boosting your immune system and maybe even improving longevity to help foster the habit of healthful breathing a san francisco technology startup recently launched a wearable device called spire that tracks breathing patterns and tells users when they are too tense or anxious one of the goals of this work was how do you make it so simple to shift into calm or focus that people don t have to stop what they re doing said neema moraveji co founder of spire and director of the calming technology lab at stanford university many early buyers of the spire are office workers who spend a lot of time on computers research has found people working on computers often hold their breath an action referred to as screen apnea he said belisa vranich a new york city based clinical psychologist has been conducting breathing workshops around the country for just over a year among her biggest clients corporate managers eager to learn how to better manage stress dr vranich says she instructs clients to breathe with their abdomen on the inhale this encourages the diaphragm to flatten out and the ribs to flare out most of us by instinct breathe vertically using our chest shoulders and neck she says abdominal or diaphragmatic breathing is often taught in yoga and meditation classes experts say air should be breathed in through the nose and the exhale should be longer than the inhale dr vranich recommends trying to breathe this way all the time but other experts say it is enough to use the technique during stressful or tense times or when it is necessary to focus or concentrate slow breathing stimulates the vagus nerve which runs from the stem of the brain to the abdomen it is part of the parasympathetic nervous system which is responsible for the body s rest and digest activities by contrast the sympathetic nervous system regulates many of our fight or flight responses the vagus nerve activity causes the heart rate to decrease as we exhale said richard gevirtz a psychology professor at alliant international university in san diego vagal activity can be activated when breathing at about five to seven breaths a minute said dr gevirtz compared with average breathing rates of about to breaths a minute the vagus nerve s response includes the release of different chemicals including acetylcholine a neurotransmitter that acts as an anti inflammatory and slows down digestion and the heart rate said stephen silberstein director of the jefferson headache center at thomas jefferson university in philadelphia who is working on an article on the vagus nerve and its functions getty images when medical conditions are severe such as with epilepsy medical devices are sometimes implanted to stimulate the vagus nerve for most people slow steady breathing is a natural way to stimulate the nerve certain conditions including asthma and panic disorders have been shown to benefit from a different breathing technique taking shallow breaths through the nose at a regular rhythmic speed of eight to breaths a minute for these patients already anxious about their symptoms deep breathing can cause them to take in too much air and hyperventilate heart rate variability biofeedback uses breathing to train people to increase the variation in their heart rate or the interval between heartbeats the technique has been shown to have benefits for conditions including anxiety disorders and asthma biofeedback also makes breathing more efficient said paul lehrer a clinical psychologist at robert wood johnson medical school part of rutgers university in new jersey on average most people reach this balance when breathing seconds per breath spire the device that tracks individual breathing patterns is a pedometer like device that can be clipped onto pants or a bra strap and can sense breathing patterns without touching the skin a sensor detects subtle torso expansions and contractions said stanford s dr moraveji the device identifies people s baseline breathing patterns and can tell users when they are tense or may need to take a deep breath it includes an app that guides people in breathing exercises as short as seconds dr moraveji s research includes a stanford study of students that found subjects on average took breaths a minute when they were doing normal computer work compared with breaths a minute when they were relaxed he said the study was published in the proceedings of the annual acm symposium on user interface software and technology a follow up study involving subjects found that giving feedback of breathing patterns on a computer screen allowed the subjects to control their breathing without decreasing their performance on an analytical task dr moraveji said we proved that because the breath is so easily controllable you don t have to interrupt your task in order to regulate your nervous system he said the study was presented at the acm chi conference on human factors in computing systems in dr vranich the breathing coach

because of the widespread impact of high blood pressure researchers are likely to investigate in some depth any simple dietary interventions that could potentially benefit the wider population according to the centers for disease control and prevention cdc high blood pressure is either the primary cause of or contributes to more than deaths in the united states every day researchers have concluded that one glass of beetroot juice a day is enough to significantly reduce blood pressure in people with high blood pressure they conducted a placebo controlled trial with dozens of participants medical researchers have recently returned to this plant product to investigate its effect on blood pressure and explore opportunities to put it to use in modern medicine and the home management of conditions beetroot has been used since the middle ages as a treatment for ailments particularly those relating to the blood and digestion if you buy something through a link on this page we may earn a small commission how this works high blood pressure is a serious public health concern it increases the risk of more dangerous health conditions such as heart attack stroke and chronic heart failure high blood pressure is also a major risk factor for kidney disease share on pinterest beetroot juice has been investigated for the powerful effect of its nitrate content on blood pressure beetroot contains high levels of dietary nitrate no which the body converts into biologically active nitrite no and nitric oxide no in the human body no relaxes and dilates blood vessels other leafy vegetables such as lettuce and cabbage also have high levels of the compound they take it up from the soil through their roots a meta analysis of trials was published in the journal of nutrition in the researchers found that inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure one major trial was carried out at queen mary university of london qmul in the united kingdom and published in the journal hypertension the research was funded by the british heart foundation they found the following results this interesting study builds on previous research by this team and finds that a daily glass of beetroot juice can lower blood pressure in people with hypertension even those whose high blood pressure was not controlled by drug treatment dr shannon amoils british heart foundation senior research advisor for the trial prof amrita ahluwalia of the vascular pharmacology department at qmul and her colleagues recruited people aged between and years half of the participants were taking prescribed medication for high blood pressure but did not reach their target blood pressure and the rest had been diagnosed with high blood pressure but were not yet taking medication for it the participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups one group consumed a milliliter ml glass of beetroot juice and the other group had the same except their beetroot juice was nitrate free the nitrate free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group all groups consumed the juice daily for weeks they were also monitored for weeks before and after the study bringing the total trial period to weeks the trial was double blind which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement during the weeks in which they were taking the juice patients in the active supplement group whose beetroot juice contained inorganic nitrate experienced a reduction in blood pressure of millimeters of mercury mmhg the first figure is systolic pressure generated when the heart is pumping and the second figure is diastolic pressure created when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood the mmhg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range in the weeks after they stopped drinking the juice their blood pressure returned to the higher levels noted at the start of the study this is the first study that shows evidence of dietary nitrate supplementation s long lasting benefit in a group of patients with high blood pressure share on pinterest high blood pressure is a common health issue in the u s and beetroot juice acts as a natural aid the patients in the active supplement group also experienced a percent or so improvement in blood vessel dilation capacity and their artery stiffness reduced by around percent studies show that these changes are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease there were no changes in blood pressure blood vessel function or artery stiffness in the placebo group the authors note that the reduction achieved in the active supplement group is close to that achieved by medication the average reduction in blood pressure caused by a single anti hypertension drug is mmhg the study concludes these findings suggest a role for dietary nitrate as an affordable readily available adjunctive treatment in the management of patients with hypertension to put the importance of these findings in context the authors note that large scale observational studies show that for every mmhg increase in blood pressure the risk of death from heart disease goes up percent and the risk of stroke by percent,1

in a bid to increase treatments for the nation s million obese adults the food and drug administration has approved u s marketing of an implantable device that stimulates weight loss by manipulating key appetite signals passing between the brain and the gut the new device is the maestro rechargeable system manufactured by enteromedics of st paul minn while the fda has approved four medications for weight loss in the past years the maestro system is the first weight loss device to be approved since using electrical leads implanted just above the stomach and a regulator carried under the skin near the ribcage the device suppresses signals carried by the vagus nerve the device adopts a variant of a neuromodulation technique long used in the treatment of epilepsy by applying intermittent bursts of electrical current to the vagus nerve it disrupts the signals that prompt the stomach to relax expand and prepare for an influx of food advertisement we think it will be a very important tool in the toolbag of surgeons and physicians treating obesity and its co morbidities said gregory s lea senior vice president and chief financial officer of enteromedics when patients leave the diet counseling and drug world and have nothing more they turn to surgical procedures and only to of patients who might be eligible for bariatric surgery are getting it the fda approved the use of the device in adult patients with a body mass index or bmi between and who have at least one other obesity related condition such as type diabetes delivered by the maestro device vagal blocking therapy or vbloc offers obese patients a weight loss therapy that does not permanently alter the digestive system in the way that gastric bypass surgery does and which may be less expensive said lea he added it poses no risk of the malabsorption problems that often come with such surgery in a month clinical trial considered by the fda of subjects who received the active maestro device lost at least a quarter of their excess weight and of subjects lost at least of their excess weight on average weight loss in those subjects with an active device was about greater than that seen in subjects who received a maestro electrical pulse generator that was not activated advertisement the human body s longest cranial nerve the vagus or wandering nerve stretches from the lower abdomen up to the brain stem passing through the heart esophagus and lungs a key node in the body s involuntary nervous system it carries signals between body and brain that control heart rate digestive processes and respiration in a to minute laparoscopic procedure physicians trained to implant the new device will attach its electrical leads to the anterior and posterior trunks of the vagus nerve right at the gastric junction during a patient s waking hours the device is designed to alternate between delivering five minute bursts of high frequency energy and five minutes of inactivity during sleep the device powers down by suppressing the exchange of messages that cue hunger and ready the stomach for food the intermittent electrical currents make most feel less hungry feel full sooner and to feel full for longer most eat less and lose weight researchers testing the device also observed that like bariatric surgery it might have beneficial effects that go beyond weight loss suppressing signals between gut and brain on the vagus nerve appeared to improve the metabolic function of obese patients who got the device you actually see the effect before patients actually have had that much weight loss said dr ken fujioka a scripps institute endocrinologist and weight management expert who conducted some of the studies that led to the enteromedics device that suggests that the device may be especially beneficial for those who have developed obesity related type diabetes he said the on again off again nature of the maestro device s stimulation serves another purpose it prevents the vagus nerve s gut signals from going silent a communication loss that would likely prompt the central nervous system to find a compensatory workaround as a result said lea the maestro device appears to be safe and effective for long term use and unlike surgical alterations to the digestive system reversible women who have had the device implanted and became pregnant were able to have it inactivated during their pregnancy and then reactivated afterward he said while the cost of the device has not yet been set lea said that getting the device implanted and activated will likely cost somewhere between and an amount that is more than gastric banding but less some of the most complex gastric bypass surgery advertisement the company has begun negotiations with private insurers and the device has been been recognized as exploratory by the board that sets policy for medicare reimbursements and lea expressed hope that some might agree to cover the procedure as early as later this year

photo can a cup of blueberries keep the doctor away maybe researchers conducted a randomized double blind placebo controlled study of postmenopausal women ages to with high blood pressure half ate grams of freeze dried blueberry powder equivalent to a cup of blueberries daily for eight weeks the others consumed an identical looking and tasting placebo the study in the journal of the academy of nutrition and dietetics found that those who ate the blueberry preparation saw an average percent decrease in systolic blood pressure the top number and a percent decrease in diastolic pressure levels of nitric oxide known to be involved in relaxing and widening blood vessels increased significantly in the blueberry eaters there were no significant changes in the placebo group the improvement the scientists write was moderate compared with that of blood pressure medicines but they say eating blueberries in larger amounts or for longer periods could increase the effect the lead author sarah a johnson a postdoctoral researcher at florida state university said she saw no reason for people to radically change their diet but that if they are not eating blueberries they might want to try them there is something very special about the composition of blueberries that is responsible for their effect on blood pressure she said other fruits and plant extracts have not produced the same result,1
the results of the comparison showed that slow metabolizers did just as well on a nicotine patch or the drug varenicline marketed as chantix a drug that works on the nicotine receptors in the brain but the patch costs less and has fewer side effects than varenicline including nausea difficulty sleeping and abnormal dreams so the researchers concluded that slow metabolizers should be put on the patch ad ad normal metabolizers of nicotine meanwhile had more success with varenicline because they tend to rid their systems of nicotine faster limiting the effectiveness of the patch varenicline contains no nicotine the slower metabolizers they do very well with the patch and they get no incremental benefit from varenicline lerman said in an interview why spend the money why have the side effects this may seem like common sense but no one had ever tested it before she said and given how difficult it is to kick the habit smokers need all the help they can get to succeed the first time they try lerman said each time somebody fails it affects their self confidence lerman said the trial and error approach is not optimal ad researchers did not test nicotine gum because it delivers a less consistent flow of nicotine to the user she said the patch worn on the skin delivers a steady flow of the drug she said in some of the test groups overall success rates were fairly low lerman noted but the study was conducted during the great recession a time when financial stress may have depressed the chances of succeeding for everyone regardless of which approach was used this post has been updated ad,1

just an avocado a day can significantly lower your cholesterol and reduce the risk of heart disease a new study shows avocados are rich in so called healthy fats and other nutrients and the study published in the journal of the american heart association shows the creamy fruit can work within weeks to lower cholesterol just like olive oil and nuts avocados have plaque busting monounsaturated fatty acids and the effects seem similar to all the benefits from a mediterranean diet the researchers said and it s one more piece of evidence in favor of adding good fats to the diet avocados can lower your cholesterol a new study shows today in the past we used to substitute carbohydrate for saturated fat and that would result in a low fat diet said penny kris etherton chair of the american heart association s nutrition committee and distinguished professor of nutrition at pennsylvania state university now we re seeing that it s better for people to have good fats in their diet at the expense of saturated fat and so the current message is to replace saturated fat with unsaturated fat and in so doing consume a moderate fat diet not too much and also not too little kris etherton told nbc news kris etherton and colleagues did an intensive study with typical americans all overweight or obese but with healthy cholesterol and blood pressure levels it s tough to test diets in real life because people eat so many different things but the team controlled what everyone ate feeding them carefully calibrated diets one was a lower fat diet without avocado another was a moderate fat diet without avocado and the third added one avocado per day to the moderate fat diet trending stories celebrity news and all the best of today this site is protected by recaptcha privacy policy terms of service the two moderate fat diets looked a lot like the average american diet with about a third of calories coming from fat the lower fat diet provided percent of calories from fat everyone spent five weeks on each diet no one lost weight but their low density lipoprotein ldl or bad cholesterol levels changed all diets decreased ldl cholesterol the main lipid risk factor for cardiovascular disease but the diet with the avocado decreased ldl cholesterol the most kris etherton said americans are advised to keep total cholesterol below and preferably below ldl should be below while they were eating the avocado a day diet the volunteers saw their ldl go down by more than points compared to their usual levels kris etherton s team reported in the journal of the american heart association ldl was points lower on the moderate fat diet without the avocado and points less on the lower fat diet the volunteers all ate hass avocados which have bumpy green skin the hass avocado board helped pay for the research which was also funded by the u s government in addition to monounsaturated fats the avocados contain fiber phytosterols and polyphenols all of which can help lower cholesterol avocados also contain natural sugars that may help regulate blood sugar we need to focus on getting people to eat a heart healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient rich food sources of better fats kris etherton said all the foods were exactly the same except the avocado versus oils that were high in monounsaturated fat on the moderate fat diet so that was the only difference between the two diets which then tells us that it s the avocado that has additional benefits which are beyond the unsaturated fat the findings are similar to a batch of studies that showed people who were given olive oil and nuts and told to add them to their diets ended up healthier they were less likely to have strokes or heart attacks and they were less likely to die over a period of years than people who didn t get the extra oils saturated fat the kind found in meat and butter has a different chemical structure from the unsaturated fats found in plant products repeated studies have shown it raises the risk of heart disease we studied avocados but maybe a lot of other fruits and vegetables have these bioactive components which have additional cholesterol lowering effects kris etherton said and certainly there s an emerging research base showing that some of these bioactive components may affect another lipoprotein particle favorably like high density lipoprotein i think we need to stay tuned for that americans may not be used to eating avocado but kris etherton says it s easy to add consumers can include avocados in their diet in salads they can include avocados on top of a sandwich or in a sandwich they can make guacamole and use vegetables rather than chips as the dip she said i love guacamole and with my recipe i ll use avocados cilantro lime juice and garlic and then sometimes i ll put salsa in or red pepper flakes but like anything too much of a good thing can be harmful avocados are definitely not low calorie food one avocado has around to calories so i would strongly urge people not to just add an avocado a day to their diet but they have to substitute nutrient poor calories which are so popular in the u s diet kris etherton said erika edwards contributed to this story,1
a new study claims that consuming one avocado a day as part of a moderate fat diet could help lower bad cholesterol among people who are overweight or obese share on pinterest consuming one avocado a day alongside a moderate fat diet was found to lower bad cholesterol among overweight and obese individuals the researchers including senior author penny m kris etherton phd distinguished professor of nutrition at pennsylvania state university publish their findings in the journal of the american heart association it is well known that avocados are high in fat but the majority of an avocado s fat is monounsaturated which is deemed a good type of fat it is known that monounsaturated fats can help lower levels of bad cholesterol reducing the risk of heart attack and stroke for their study kris etherton and colleagues set out to assess how avocado consumption by replacing saturated fatty acids or bad fats affected risk factors associated with cardiovascular diseases the team recruited healthy participants aged years who were either obese or overweight every participant was required to follow each of three cholesterol lowering diets for weeks the diets consisted of a lower fat diet without avocado a moderate fat diet without avocado or a moderate fat diet with one hass avocado a day prior to starting each diet subjects ate what the researchers deem an average american diet which was made up of of calories from fat from protein while around half of calories were from carbohydrates from both of the moderate fat diets participants gained of calories from fat of which were from monounsaturated fatty acids mufas the lower fat diet provided participants with of calories from fat of which was from mufas moderate fat diet with one avocado a day lowered bad cholesterol by mg dl the researchers found that participants levels of low density lipoprotein ldl referred to as the bad cholesterol were an average of milligrams per deciliter mg dl lower after following the lower fat diet without an avocado and mg dl lower after following the moderate fat diet without an avocado compared with their baseline average however after participants followed the moderate fat diet with one avocado a day their ldl levels were found to be an average of mg dl lower than their baseline average what is more the team found that a number of additional blood measurements such as total cholesterol small dense ldl triglycerides and non hdl high density lipoprotein were better after participants followed the moderate fat diet with one avocado a day compared with the other two diets although these findings demonstrate that an avocado a day alongside a moderate fat diet has the potential to reduce bad cholesterol the team notes that their research was a controlled feeding study that is not the real world says kris etherton so it is a proof of concept investigation still the team believes their findings indicate that people should consider replacing saturated fatty acids in their diet with healthier fats from avocados and other sources kris etherton adds we need to focus on getting people to eat a heart healthy diet that includes avocados and other nutrient rich food sources of better fats in the united states avocados are not a mainstream food yet and they can be expensive especially at certain times of the year also most people do not really know how to incorporate them in their diet except for making guacamole but guacamole is typically eaten with corn chips which are high in calories and sodium avocados however can also be eaten with salads vegetables sandwiches lean protein foods like chicken or fish or even whole it should be noted that this research was supported by the hass avocado board but the researchers say the organization played no other role in the study in january medical news today reported on a study suggesting that consuming half an avocado with lunch each day may satisfy hunger in overweight individuals and help with weight management our knowledge center article on the health benefits of avocado reveals some of the other ways the food may be good for us as well as the potential risks of avocado consumption,1
bite back at bad cholesterol eat an avocado a day enlarge this image toggle caption tastyart ltd rob white getty images tastyart ltd rob white getty images new research finds that eating an avocado per day as part of an overall diet rich in healthy fats may help cut the bad kind cholesterol known as ldl researchers at pennsylvania state university recruited overweight participants who agreed to try three different types of cholesterol lowering diets their study was published wednesday in the journal of the american heart association one was a low fat diet that included lots of fruits low fat dairy poultry whole grains and small amounts of red meat the other two diets were moderately high in fat with about percent of total calories consumed per day coming from fat the types of foods and meals were similar to the low fat diet but included more nuts and oils one of the moderately high fat diets included a daily serving of one avocado in one sample meal plan lunch was chicken salad with half an avocado and dinner included turkey tacos with another half an avocado the diets were similar in terms of macronutrients like protein and fats and calories the only difference between the two was the avocado the other diet had the same amount of fat from other sources at the end of the study the researchers found that the avocado diet led to significant reductions in ldl cholesterol compared with the other two diets to put the difference in perspective the avocado diet decreased ldl cholesterol about milligrams per deciliter of blood compare that with a decrease of about mg dl for the low fat diet and about a mg dl drop from the moderate fat diet i was surprised to see the added benefit of the avocado penny kris etherton a nutrition scientist at penn state and the lead author of the study tells us it s something in the avocado other than just the fat composition she says she says she d like to do follow up research to look at the bioactive compounds in avocados which may explain the added reduction in ldl cholesterol in the study participants it s also possible that the fiber in avocados plays a role in the cholesterol lowering effect she says but one caveat for anyone who loves guacamole when it s served up with chips the calories can add up a mere half cup of guacamole has about calories all on its own kris etherton s study was funded in part by the national center for research resources part of the national institutes of health it was also supported by a grant from the hass avocado board an industry group that the researchers say had no role in the design of the study or the interpretation of the data we asked kris etherton if she would have published the results had there been no positive findings for the avocado oh absolutely she told us the agreement was to publish no matter the results and given the reduction in funds available for research it s become increasingly common for researchers to carry out these kinds of industry supported studies,1
women who want to quit smoking may find it easier if they time their efforts just right a new study finds hormone fluctuations that occur over the course of a woman s menstrual cycle may impact her ability to kick the cigarette habit according to small study conducted by researchers at the university of montreal women are more likely to crave cigarettes and have trouble quitting when in the follicular phase of their monthly cycle this is the time right after her period and before ovulation while overall more men than women smoke cigarettes women and girls take less time to become dependent after initial use and have more difficulties quitting the habit the researchers write in their study one of the factors contributing to these differences may be that women crave cigarettes more than men and that their desire to smoke is influenced by hormonal fluctuations across the menstrual cycle the study which was published in psychiatry journal involved women and men who were all chronic smokers but otherwise healthy none of the study participants were enrolled in a smoking cessation program or were trying to quit researchers asked each participant to smoke one cigarette to minutes before undergoing an fmri or brain scan they were asked to view photos both related and unrelated to smoking after undergoing the brain scans they viewed the photos a second time and reported on a scale from zero to if the pictures triggered cigarette cravings the researchers tested of the female participants twice to assess how their response changed at a different point in their menstrual cycle the brain scans showed that during the follicular stage cigarette imagery activated five areas of the brain which the researchers say are linked to higher level cravings however during the luteal phase after a woman ovulates and before her period only one area of the brain was activated by images of cigarettes and smoking during the luteal phase estrogen and progesterone levels are at their highest which may help a woman keep addictive cravings at bay and reduce feelings of cigarette withdrawal previous studies have found women s monthly hormone fluctuations can affect everything from food cravings and digestive problems to joint pain and a whole host of other health issues this result emphasizes the need for gender specific programs to quit smoking as well as taking into consideration a menstrual cycle phase during addiction treatment in women the researchers conclude they called for more studies to help understand all the factors that contribute to sex and gender differences in smoking,1
photo phys ed gretchen reynolds on the science of fitness active older people resemble much younger people physiologically according to a new study of the effects of exercise on aging the findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is to a large degree up to us aging remains a surprisingly mysterious process a wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older but science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays or result at least in part from lifestyle meaning that they are mutable this conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays and being sedentary affects health making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older in the new study which was published this week in the journal of physiology scientists at king s college london and the university of birmingham in england decided to use a different approach they removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit we wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best case scenario said stephen harridge senior author of the study and director of the centre of human and aerospace physiological sciences at king s college london to accomplish that goal the scientists recruited men and women aged between and who bicycle regularly the volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes the men had to be able to ride at least miles in six and a half hours and the women miles in five and a half hours benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people the scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests the scientists determined each cyclist s endurance capacity muscular mass and strength pedaling power metabolic health balance memory function bone density and reflexes they also had the volunteers complete the so called timed up and go test during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms briskly walks about feet turns walks back and sits down again the researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging if a particular test s numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages the researchers considered then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age as it turned out the cyclists did not show their age on almost all measures their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age as a group even the oldest cyclists had younger people s levels of balance reflexes metabolic health and memory ability and their timed up and go results were exemplary many older people require at least seconds to complete the task with those requiring or seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty dr harridge said but even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely seconds for the walk which is well within the norm reported for healthy young adults the study authors write some aspects of aging did however prove to be ineluctable the oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their s and early s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent dr harridge said even if we exercise but even so both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged or above all in all the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active if you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results dr harridge said it would be impossible on paper they all look young of course this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults dr harridge said he and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and years which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging but even in advance of those results said dr harridge himself almost and an avid cyclist this study shows that being physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person s,1

reuters a new type of asthma drug meant to attack the underlying causes of the respiratory disease slashed episodes by percent in a mid stage trial making it a potential game changer for patients with moderate to severe disease researchers said on tuesday overall these are the most exciting data we ve seen in asthma in years said dr sally wenzel lead investigator for the patient study of dupilumab an injectable treatment being developed by regeneron pharmaceuticals inc and french drugmaker sanofi the drug also met all its secondary goals such as improving symptoms and lung function and reducing the need for standard drugs called beta agonists although far larger trials will be needed to confirm findings from the proof of concept study researchers expressed optimism they noted that dupilumab has also shown the ability to tame atopic dermatitis or severe eczema an allergic condition that is not well controlled by current treatments results of the week asthma study are being presented on tuesday at the annual scientific meeting of the american thoracic society in philadelphia the medicine if approved could hold promise for patients with moderate to severe persistent asthma that is not well controlled by standard drugs we have been treating asthma with sort of band aid therapies that didn t get at the underlying causes wenzel said in an interview adding that dupilumab could be an important step in going to the root of the problem the drug works by simultaneously blocking proteins that have been linked to inflammation interleukin il and interleukin il hits elusive targets wenzel director of the asthma institute at the university of pittsburgh said other drugmakers have tested medicines that block one or both of the proteins but without success the trial recruited patients with high levels of eosinophils a biomarker that shows immune system cells called type helper t cells th cells associated with allergy and asthma have been activated such patients were deemed likely to benefit from treatment all patients initially stayed on their standard asthma treatments meaning medium to high doses of inhaled glucocorticoids as well as long acting beta agonists but patients gradually tapered off on those drugs and were no longer taking either of them after weeks throughout the phase iia trial half the patients also received weekly injections of dupilumab while half received placebo injections after the ninth week percent of those on placebos had experienced exacerbations a catch all term that included the need to take a beta agonist a decrease in lung function the need for an oral or inhaled corticosteroid or if the patient went to the hospital or emergency room for worsening asthma by end of the trial after weeks percent of those in the placebo group had exacerbations compared with percent of those on dupilumab wenzel said that represented an percent reduction in exacerbations which was highly statistically significant wenzel said dupilumab was well tolerated with side effects similar to placebo but she cautioned that longer trials are needed to fully assess the drug regeneron and sanofi said standard drugs are unable to control asthma in to percent of patients they estimate that inflammation caused by th cells the type of inflammation among patients they tested affects up to million people in the united states and up to million worldwide dupilumab has also shown strong hints of safety and effectiveness in two early stage trials that involved patients with atopic dermatitis larger studies are slated to begin later this year atopic dermatitis is inherited and involves patches of highly itchy skin on any part of the body patients many of whom also have asthma and hay fever have compared the sensation to having unending poison ivy this asthma data and the data we already have in atopic dermatitis really raises the possibility the scientific community has finally hit upon the key pathway across all these allergic diseases george yancopoulos regeneron s research chief said in an interview trial results were also reported on tuesday in the new england journal of medicine along with an editorial that said results of the study appeared compelling at first glance and superior to those seen in previous studies of other asthma drugs but the editorial said effectiveness of dupilumab has been established in just a limited subpopulation of patients with asthma because only percent of those screened for enrollment in the study met its criteria we do not know whether dupilumab will be effective in other patient populations the editorial said including patients that stay on their standard therapies and who do not have high levels of eosinophils,1
they made some interesting observations about gene mutations that were already known to cause heart diseases but the del sontros offered the possibility of discovering an entirely new genetic pathway to heart disease now eight family members have joined the study and dr biesecker is searching for more even so finding the tiny troublemaking genetic glitches in the family s genes is an intimidating task there are genes in each person s dna and each gene is can be made up of a string of hundreds of dna letters and can harbor variations most of the variations are meaningless in the entire dna which contains genes and regions that control genes there are six billion dna letters to check to figure out what dna changes might be important the researchers are comparing the dna sequences of rick del sontro and his family with those of others in the study looking for genetic changes that occur in every member of the del sontro family who has heart disease but that are not generally found in healthy people dr biesecker acknowledged that there was no guarantee of success he and his colleagues know the gene mutation in the del sontro family must be rare otherwise lots of people would have early heart disease but no obvious risk factors to keep the focus on truly rare mutations the researchers are excluding those that are present in both members of the del sontro family and percent or more of the other study participants that strategy alone dr biesecker said has eliminated the vast majority of candidate genes the researchers are now searching for culprits among genes that remain a search that could take years or the change might be in a poorly understood region of dna that controls genes rather than in a gene itself researchers ignorance of these control regions and what many of them do might doom the effort so the researchers are hoping the del sontro family s heart disease is caused by a mutated gene our main job is to find the gene dr biesecker said still mr del sontro is preparing for the worst he has life insurance and long term care insurance i keep waiting for the day when i have shortness of breath he said when his heart disease was first diagnosed four and a half years ago mr del sontro now told his cardiologist he wanted to run one more bay to breakers race a century old kilometer race in san francisco his doctor told him absolutely not saying you are the kind of guy we will read about who dies during the race of a massive heart attack mr del sontro could still exercise his cardiologist said but no more than minutes a day,1
getty images maskot getty images maskot a breakthrough in helping the body to produce more insulin could make tedious injections of the hormone history in type diabetes the body gradually loses its ability to make enough insulin to keep up with the sugar coming in from the diet eventually the overwhelmed system leaves these sugars in the form of glucose to build up in the blood which can lead to obesity damage the heart and cause other metabolic problems and while insulin injections are an effective way to break down the glucose keeping track of blood sugar levels with regular finger pricks and repeated insulin shots aren t an ideal way to treat a chronic disease but despite decades of research scientists haven t found a better way to address the problem more half of diabetes cases are undiagnosed now researchers working with mice at the harvard stem cell institute report in the journal cell that they have discovered a hormone betatrophin that can prompt the body to generate more insulin producing beta cells and if the work is confirmed the hormone could potentially do away with the need for regular insulin shots we don t understand the cause of type diabetes but everyone agrees that having more beta cells is better says douglas melton senior author of the paper and co director of the harvard stem cell institute no one doubts that s not a good idea more should you take statins study says heart benefits outweigh diabetes risk it s an exciting breakthrough in diabetes research which for many years was focused on finding ways to externally supplement the body s waning insulin levels that s because experts believed that once the pancreatic islet cells the body s insulin making factories were compromised they couldn t be made to work again what s more they also surmised that only a specialized set of beta cells were equipped to make insulin and that once diabetes set in too few of these cells remained to pump out the critical hormone melton however whose work focuses on understanding how stem cells might enhance beta cell production admits that he is obsessed with the insulin making cells and reported in that all beta cells appeared to have the ability to produce insulin his pursuit of a better understanding of this population and the forces that cause them to falter in diabetes led his team to the discovery of betatrophin more stem cell research the quest resumes in animal studies mice that were treated with another compound that compromised their ability to respond to insulin suddenly revved up production of more beta cells to compensate and melton s team was able to isolate the hormone responsible betatrophin over the course of a few weeks mice bred to develop diabetes but injected with betatrophin were increased their beta cell population by times i was impressed by the fact that the number of beta cells in the mice doubled in one week with one injection says melton that s a huge difference what s more it appears the cells are relatively long lasting which could indicate they are robust enough to bring glucose levels in diabetics under control in theory if the same results occur in people it s possible that those on the verge of developing diabetes might never progress to develop the disease since the high blood sugar levels that can cause damage to tissues and lead the body to become less responsive to insulin could be avoided it s also possible that diabetics could lower their dependence on insulin and might even be able to wean themselves off of the injection altogether if their beta cell production is robust enough to provide the insulin they need more type diabetes is tougher to treat in kids and teens even if it doesn t address insulin resistance what betatrophin will do is lower blood sugar and anything that lowers blood sugar can make you healthier he says more work will be needed to confirm what benefit betatrophin might have on diabetic patients before that might be possible however john anderson president of medicine and science for the american diabetes association says it s very promising and opens up new avenues of research but we are a long way from replacing insulin or a cure or even knowing how this hormone will work in human tissue those concerns aren t lost on melton who also recognizes that more research is needed to confirm that betatrophin may benefit patients i am aware of the fact that given our level of ignorance everything seems simple and straightforward he says but i am prepared to have it become more complicated,1
en español by alan mozes healthday reporter sunday april healthday news a method designed to target freeze and destroy a tumor s cellular function seems effective in combating lung tumors a small ongoing study finds at least in the short run meaning three months after the procedure the intervention known as cryoablation appeared to kill all targeted tumors that had spread to the lung from elsewhere preliminary results suggest however some patients developed new tumors in that time period the researchers noted the study authors cautioned that while the initial findings are encouraging the treatment should not be seen as a cure for this type of metastatic spreading lung disease rather they said that for certain patients who may not be eligible for more standard surgical approaches the therapy has potential as an alternative means for offering an improved quality of life for a longer period of time promising is the perfect way to describe our findings said study lead author dr david woodrum an interventional radiologist at the mayo clinic in rochester minn but whether or not this minimally invasive approach would ultimately become a primary method of treatment in the future will depend on the long term results of this trial which is still under way at this point i would say that cryoablation has the most applicability as a kind of last ditch treatment for patients who are not good surgical candidates for a variety of reasons woodrum and his colleagues are scheduled to discuss their findings sunday in new orleans at the annual meeting of the society of interventional radiology funding for their work was provided by galil medical a medical device manufacturer based in arden hills minn because this study was presented at a medical meeting the conclusions should be considered preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal the u s national cancer institute points out that while cryoablation also known as cryosurgery is a well known practice researchers are still in the process of assessing its long term benefits the procedure is performed by an interventional radiologist on patients coping with metastasized lung tumors the researchers noted using ct imaging equipment the physician inserts a small needle like instrument directly into the tumor to deliver the freezing power at temperatures as low as minus degrees celsius of liquid nitrogen to cancer cells while sparing healthy surrounding tissue to date the team behind the new study has used the procedure to tackle a total of tumors in american and french patients men and nine women whose average age was fifteen patients had just one tumor while the rest had two or more none of the patients was deemed eligible for standard surgical interventions the targeted tumors were less than centimeters about inches which woodrum described as being small to medium in size the procedure was performed under either general anesthesia or conscious sedation and lasted anywhere from minutes to nearly three hours typically patients were able to return home the following day the result among the patients seen roughly three months post procedure tumor control was found to be percent although six patients were found to have developed new lung tumors in the interim among five patients seen six months after the procedure tumor control continued to be percent the authors noted that side effects were minimal typically involving air or fluid around the lungs after the procedure and in all cases were resolved quickly the team concluded that cryoablation appears to be both safe and effective at least in the short term but they acknowledged that more research needs to be done to track the treatment s impact over the long haul it would be overreaching to say that we re curing cancer with this woodrum said but this is one of many therapy options that is looking to turn cancer into a chronic fight and to give patients for whom the choices are limited a chance at a good quality of life with minimal treatment complications for his part dr david carbone a professor and director of the james thoracic center at the ohio state university wexner medical center said that the findings regarding cryoablation are not incredibly novel given that the procedure has been around for years and i would say that there are multiple different technologies for doing this kind of very localized approach he added he mentioned stereotactic radiosurgery which targets the tumor with high power x rays as another way to go while i ve done cryoablation myself in the past it s not what i typically do carbone noted stereotactic is noninvasive and doesn t require general anesthesia so that s what i d tend to do although certainly what approach is ideal will depend on a particular patient s situation and symptoms but there s no situation in which cryoablation would be the only theoretical option more information for more about cryoablation visit the u s national cancer institute,1

en español by alan mozes healthday reporter monday march healthday news an experimental breath test designed to quickly identify patients suffering from heart failure simply by analyzing the contents of a single exhaled breath has demonstrated promise in early trials a team of researchers says the investigators stressed that their evaluation is based on a small group of participating patients and that more extensive research will have to be done to confirm their initial success but by subjecting a patient s breath to a rigorous but fast analysis of the hundreds of so called volatile organic compounds contained therein the study team said it has so far been able to correctly diagnose heart failure among newly hospitalized patients with a percent accuracy every individual has a breath print that differentiates them from other people depending on what s going on in their body explained study lead author dr raed dweik a staff physician in the department of pulmonary allergy and critical care medicine with the respiratory institute at cleveland clinic and that print can tell us a lot about a person what they ve been exposed to and what disease they have he added that s what makes the new field of breath testing so promising because it is non intrusive so there is no risk involved dweik said and you can do it anywhere in a clinic in a hospital anywhere the findings were published march in the journal of the american college of cardiology the study authors pointed out that the most common reason american patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure a tough to treat condition in which the heart s pumping action grows gradually weaker over time currently a diagnosis of heart failure comes from a variety of factors according to the u s national heart lung and blood institute these include medical history and symptoms and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient s heart and lung sounds and check ankles feet legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists in the new study to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure the team collected exhaled breath samples from patients who had been admitted as in patients to the cleveland clinic of those had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of acute decompensated heart failure while another patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues a single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within hours of admission as well as from an additional patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison within two hours of collection all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis which relied upon mass spectrometry technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure the result the breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue dr gregg fonarow a professor of cardiology at the university of california los angeles said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness a breath driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation but more so in a doctor s office or clinic than in the hospital if it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive then yes it would be a welcome advance he said but i would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting because that is where it s most challenging to identify heart failure today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient s history and exam but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses and the blood work that would be taken in a doctor s office might not come back until the next day delaying identification he noted so a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation fonarow said but in an emergency room while there are challenges as well bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes so there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting study author dweik added that the test is theoretically cheap but of course we re still early in the process of exploring its potential this study is really a proof of concept there is much more work that needs to be done to get it to the point where it would become widely available more information for more on heart failure visit the u s national heart lung and blood institute,1
correction a previous version of this story had an incorrect spelling of physical therapist patrick kennelly s name and an incorrect location for his practice this version has been updated hip replacement involves removing the joint the damaged bone and cartilage and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal plastic or ceramics in a break from past practice some surgeons prefer to cut into the joint from the front anthony unger anthony unger over the past two decades the number of americans having total hip replacements has more than doubled to more than a year though most patients eventually walk again without pain or the aid of a cane recovery and rehabilitation can be rigorous painful and lengthy the surgery is extensive as its name suggests it involves removing the joint the damaged bone and cartilage and replacing it with prosthetic parts made of metal plastic or ceramics typically surgeons enter the joint from the rear which requires cutting through muscle and cartilage but with a relatively new procedure surgeons enter from the front and only stretch the muscles aside avoiding the cutting and minimizing pain and recovery time according to those who use this anterior technique the benefits are substantial anthony unger medical director at the institute of bone and joint health at sibley memorial hospital and a clinical professor of orthopedic surgery at george washington university hospital says the anterior approach is truly minimally invasive unger who has done about hip replacements over years and has used the anterior technique for the past eight years says patients have better overall functionality can sleep on their sides and be confident the new hip won t dislocate but as with many transitions in medical techniques some surgeons have been reluctant to change although agencies and hospitals don t track hip replacements by the type of procedure used unger says that based on statistics from the american association of hip and knee surgeons only percent of its members choose the anterior approach joshua jacobs a vice president of the american association of orthopaedic surgeons and chairman of orthopedic surgery at rush university in chicago says the aaos doesn t endorse or promote one specific technique or procedure over another jacobs prefers the posterior approach which he says has been reliable for him he says that while he s heard about the benefits of the anterior approach he s not aware of a randomized controlled trial comparing the posterior and anterior approach that shows a definite superiority of one over the other what s key is that surgeons need to do the approach they re most comfortable with to get the best outcomes teetering like chaplin a study by unger in the journal of bone and joint surgery in found that with the anterior procedure there was less muscle damage and inflammation both in the immediate postoperative period and two days later than with the posterior approach others surgeons who prefer the anterior procedure say it preserves more of the normal anatomy which also means fewer medications and shorter hospital stays michael bollinger who operates at palm drive hospital in sebastopol calif switched methods a few years ago with the anterior approach bollinger says we can take x rays during the operation to see if the new hip is placed correctly and adjust it when necessary many surgeons use a special operating table that makes this possible although surgeons can also take x rays during the posterior procedure it is much more difficult and they wait until patients are in the recovery room where bollinger says there s not much that can be done he explains that while the body tolerates an imperfect alignment pretty well if a new hip gets dislocated it s often because it s not in perfectly the anterior approach offers other benefits robert saunders a nurse at alta bates summit medical center in berkeley calif sees about hip replacement patients a year he says that nurses love the anterior approach because there s less worry about dislocating the joint with the posterior approach we have to spread patients legs apart and strap them to a pillow to keep the new joint in place if they want to move or roll over they can t he says saunders says the anterior patients also have an easier time with physical therapy which can start the same day as the surgery those who ve had the posterior procedure have a lot of pain since when they sit up they re right on top the incision he explains patrick kennelly a physical therapist with smartherapy in chevy chase says people who have the anterior procedure don t feel so weak because their hip muscles haven t been cut if they ve had the posterior procedure even if they don t consciously feel weak they tend to shift their weight onto one foot and teeter like charlie chaplin cautious surgeons given benefits such as these why haven t more surgeons switched methods unger says that most surgeons have used the posterior approach for years have fine results and see no need to switch also he says they work in a very high stress high liability environment for this reason new techniques are adapted slowly with extreme care and in some cases not at all unger adds that surgeons are naturally cautious and typically wait to see results from many studies before they switch methods besides his study there have only been a few others one a prospective randomized study by william barrett an orthopedic surgeon in the seattle area compared the two approaches in a peer reviewed paper he presented at the annual aaos meeting and found benefits with the anterior approach another obstacle to the widespread use of the newer approach is that if established surgeons want to switch they face time and cost constraints they must get training in classes and cadaver labs and the learning curve can be steep unger says his was relatively short about cases others say it took about cases and this creates economic issues if you re a busy surgeon you have a volume to maintain bollinger says and it s hard to go from doing three a day to one during the learning period christopher chen a surgeon who uses the anterior approach at alta bates summit adds that most doctors still use the posterior approach because it s the one they were taught and he says the majority of younger surgeons learn the older approach because established surgeons are typically the ones who staff the residency training programs and demonstrate the method they know best most surgeons don t profit from choosing one approach over another chen says if there is a financial incentive for promoting the newer technique he says it is that more patients will want the anterior approach so that the surgeon does more surgeries and therefore collects more professional fees for that william hamilton who operates at the anderson orthopaedic clinic at inova mt vernon hospital trains young surgeons to do the anterior approach in a year long hip and knee replacement fellowship program hamilton says that during this time they re taught both approaches but he adds that since of the fellows he trained use the anterior procedure as their primary approach in their practices hamilton says that a decade ago very few residencies and fellowships taught the anterior approach now several institutions around the country have at least one surgeon teaching it so when students leave and begin their practices it s no longer foreign to them hamilton who has performed anterior procedures and strongly supports the method says that despite growing interest it will take a generation of new surgeons before use of the anterior approach is widespread patients aren t informed many patients aren t aware of the option the case of daniel ellsberg who in released the pentagon papers a secret study about u s involvement in vietnam is instructive his hip had been hurting for about a year and when he decided to have surgery his primary care physician recommended a respected surgeon just days before the operation last july a friend told him about the anterior approach i d never heard of it and neither my doctor nor surgeon mentioned it i called the surgeon s office learned he did the posterior procedure asked for and got a recommendation for one who performs the anterior one and my experience was amazing the same day as the operation i walked down the hall with a walker i was home in three days and a week later i walked one or two blocks without pain or a cane in a month i bodysurfed at the beach says ellsberg who is margot machol who is two decades younger and lives in washington had both hips replaced the first with the posterior procedure several years ago the second with the anterior procedure last october unger performed both surgeries after the first i needed pain medicine when i came home from the hospital also i had a long list of restrictions of what i could and couldn t do so the hip wouldn t pop out for six weeks i had to sleep on my back couldn t cross my legs and wasn t able to drive after the second i didn t take any pain pills once i was home slept on my side soon after the surgery had almost no rules and drove my car in two weeks i even wanted to ski over christmas because i felt fine machol says koeppel is a writer based in washington,1
deep brain stimulation device helped stabilise mood half of patients in small trial gained weight anorexia among most common psychiatric disorders in girls by kate kelland london march reuters scientists have for the first time reported successful use of a brain stimulating implant to help patients with severe anorexia whose condition had not improved with other treatments doctors implanted a device similar to a pacemaker in the brains of six severe anorexics and found at least half put on weight and showed improvements in mood under previous therapies none had shown progress this success in a small study designed as a pilot to test the safety of the technique suggests larger trials will confirm the effectiveness of the deep brain stimulation dbs device the researchers wrote in the medical journal the lancet anorexia has one of the highest mortality rates of any psychiatric disorder and is among the most common psychiatric disorders in girls aged between and years symptoms include deliberate weight loss induced and sustained by the patient and a need to control calorie intake and output treatment usually focuses on changing behaviour but experts say up to percent of patients get no benefit from such treatments and are at risk of dying prematurely commenting on the results of this small trial janet treasure and ulrike schmidt of king s college london s institute of psychiatry said the technique looked promising and would give hope to patients with especially pernicious forms of anorexia the fact that the procedure was associated with improvements in affective and obsessional symptoms is of key importance they said this will go some way towards reassuring patients that dbs is not just another treatment designed to fatten them up without making them feel better dbs is used to treat several neurological illnesses including parkinson s disease and chronic pain scientists are also investigating its use in depression and epilepsy but this was the first time it had been used in patients with anorexia implanting the dbs device requires minimally invasive surgery which can be completely reversed if problems occur the researchers said for their study a team at the krembil neuroscience centre and university health network in canada identified an area of the brain known to be important when using dbs in depression they implanted electrodes into the area and connected them to a pulse generator under the skin the devices were activated days later and researchers measured changes in the patients mood and anxiety to help find the correct level of stimulation the patients all women were aged between and and had had anorexia for between four and years initially all six lost weight but researchers said this was expected since studies of dbs in patients with depression also found a delay of a few months before treatment starts to work three months after treatment the weight loss began to reverse in some patients and after nine months three patients weighed more than before treatment the longest period of sustained weight increase since they had become ill around half also had better moods and less obsessive compulsive behaviour andres lozano who led the study said the results were encouraging because they pointed to a genuine therapeutic effect rather than a placebo or hunger increasing effect he also said the improvements in mood and anxiety even in patients who were still underweight were especially striking given that severely anorexic patients did not respond well to conventional medicines or psychotherapies editing by andrew roche,1

taking folic acid before pregnancy and through the first several weeks of pregnancy may help reduce the risk of autism for those children according to a new study published tuesday in the journal of the american medical association jama researchers in norway looked at data from pregnancies and found that women who took the supplement four weeks before pregnancy and through the eighth week of pregnancy were less likely to have children with autism the norwegian study is the largest to date on the benefits of folic acid for autism prevention and marks one of the first tangible things a woman can do to reduce her risk of giving birth to a child with the disorder this is pretty exciting said alycia halladay senior director for environmental and clinical sciences for autism speaks an autism advocacy group it actually supports the idea of actionable things women can do before they become pregnant and right as conception happens experts have known for some time that taking folic acid can prevent neural tube birth defects like spina bifida in developing fetuses american congress of obstetricians and gynecologists acog guidelines call for all women of child bearing age not just those who plan to get pregnant to take micrograms of folic acid daily to prevent birth defects the same dose appears to provide some benefit in preventing autism according to the research this is another piece of evidence that supports the beneficial uses of folic acid during pregnancy said halladay who was not connected with the study the research strongly suggests that taking folic acid prior to pregnancy may reduce the risk of autism in children said dr edward r b mccabe medical director for the march of dimes the organization also recommends women of child bearing age take micrograms of folic acid daily before conceiving and to micrograms per day while pregnant but some experts aren t quite ready to tout the benefits of folic acid too loudly particularly for autism prevention it is possible that folic acid might provide protection against other neurodevelopmental disorders like autism said zachary warren director of the treatment and research institute for autism spectrum disorders at vanderbilt university who was also not involved in the study while the current study suggests such protection the data really do not establish anything close to a causal connection the norwegian researchers do admit that more studies should be done to confirm the link warren says he wishes the solution were as simple as just taking folic acid caring for individuals with autism and their families would be a whole lot easier if we had simple answers about cause and risk he says the reality is autism is a complex disorder and our best answers about causes and treatment are going to be complex as well despite the fact that a link between taking folic acid and reducing autism risk isn t fully proven halladay says there s no harm in taking the supplement and women should be taking it anyway to prevent birth defects,1
by barbara bronson gray healthday reporter friday feb healthday news for people with celiac disease everyday foods such as bread pizza crust and muffins are potential enemies but scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat rye or barley products the only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten free diet a new study however offers some potential for hope researchers have re engineered a naturally occurring enzyme kumamolisin as to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces called peptides they say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms the re engineered enzyme named kumamax appears to be highly effective at least in a test tube it dismantled more than percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease according to the study which was published recently in the journal of the american chemical society ideally the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies beano or gas x and offer it without a prescription said lead study author justin siegel assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the university of california davis but this could take a few years to develop if the researchers opt to make a prescription drug the process of clinical trials and obtaining u s food and drug administration approval could take a decade or more he said an enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing and their function is defined by their shape and structure in this case the researchers re engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment we did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein siegel said the next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals it shouldn t be toxic it s just a protein you re eating siegel said how effective might the enzyme be for some people even flour in the air makes them stop breathing some are very sensitive and in some it just upsets their stomach a little siegel said for those who are hypersensitive this probably is not going to solve the problem but it would allow them to go to dinner and in case any gluten ended up in their meal they wouldn t have to worry about it for those less sensitive they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want he added the process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution siegel said we can design a small molecule a pill that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects if any he said some experts identified limitations to the research this is the earliest phase and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human said dr joseph murray a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the mayo clinic in rochester minn let s see how it goes with a whole slice of bread murray said that dismantling percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection it will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low level exposure to glutens by accident he said but celiac disease is a common problem with about million to million americans suffering from it people need alternatives and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease murray said more information learn more about celiac disease from the u s national library of medicine,1
getty images a study shows that not all good fats are the same when it comes to protecting your health for decades the message about fats has been relatively simple reduce the amount of oils and fats you eat from animal and dairy products less red meat and cheese and substitute them with healthier fats from plants or fish olive oil omega fatty acids the difference came down to the specific type of fats that make up these foods animal and dairy fats tend to be saturated which means all of the free bonds available in a chain of carbon atoms are bound to hydrogen atoms while plant fats are unsaturated meaning some of carbon atoms have double bonds with each other saturated fats are more likely to build up within artery walls and form plaques that can trigger heart attacks but in the latest study on fats published in the bmj researchers found convincing evidence that not all plant fats are created equal and that linoleic acid or omega fatty acids may be associated with a higher risk of early death from any cause as well as increased risk of heart disease and death from heart related conditions the study is actually a reanalysis of data that had not been included in the original publication of results from the sydney diet heart study a trial that was conducted from to for more than three years researchers at the time followed men aged to years old who had a history of heart disease about half were told to replace the saturated fats they consumed from animal and dairy sources with omega linoleic acid which is commonly found in safflower oil or margarines made from it the other half were not told to change their diet in any way when that study was published in researchers noted an increased risk of early death from any cause among the omega group but did not break down the data by what caused the deaths more study good fats even better for the heart than we thought so dr christopher ramsden a clinical investigator at the national institutes of health who was interested in understanding the effects of linoleic acid on heart health contacted one of the original authors and reviewed data that had not been included in the study this information involved deaths from heart related causes and the new analysis showed that the omega group had a higher risk of dying during the study period from heart disease compared with among the control group the american heart association aha currently recommends that people replace to of their daily saturated fat intake with foods containing unsaturated fats such as canola and olive oils the aha further breaks down the unsaturated fat advice by suggesting that people devote about to of their daily calories to foods containing linoleic acid the recommendation is based on a review of the available data more study eating omega s may help reduce alzheimer s risk the latest results however raise questions about that advice ramsden says the findings provide some refined understanding of unsaturated fats which come in different chemical forms that may have varying benefits or risks i wouldn t necessarily say that the current advice is necessarily completely wrong he says what happened is that in the s all polyunsaturated fats were considered the same they were grouped together under one mechanism of being able to lower blood cholesterol levels then over the ensuing decades it became clear as science progressed that there were multiple types of polyunsaturated fats and these compounds potentially have distinct biochemical and health effects there has been some evidence to suggest that omega fatty acids for example may trigger inflammation a condition that is linked to an increased risk of heart problems while omega fatty acids found in deepwater fish like salmon tend to inhibit inflammatory reactions ramsden says the results highlight the need to study dietary ingredients in more detail rather than lumping them together and assuming they have the same effect on the body more can olive oil help prevent stroke recognizing that need the aha says it is considering re evaluating all its dietary recommendations and will make the issue of polyunsaturated fats part of this assessment reviewing the dietary advice as a whole is important says alice lichtenstein a spokesperson for the association since changes in one area could have unexpected and potentially harmful effects on other eating habits when health organizations advised people to lower their intake of saturated fats for example many replaced the fats with carbohydrates which can increase risk of diabetes and lead to higher levels of another type of fat in the blood triglycerides one of the things we learned is that we need to look at the whole picture says lichtenstein just looking at one individual component puts undue emphasis on that component and may lead to unanticipated consequences we need to look at dietary patterns rather than individual nutrients or individual food components whether the association will change its advice about consuming linoleic acid isn t clear yet but ramsden says the results of the latest study could have important implications for the way people eat if they want to stay heart healthy,1
by alan mozes healthday reporter wednesday feb healthday news enduring dietary wisdom that polyunsaturated vegetable fats are better for your heart than saturated animal fats may be turned on its head by a fresh analysis of a nearly year old study the reasoning has been that a diet rich in omega polyunsaturated fats lowers cholesterol and is therefore good for heart health but an updated look at the study indicates that heart disease patients who follow this advice may actually increase their risk for death the original sydney diet heart study was initially conducted between and at a time when the cholesterol lowering benefits of all polyunsaturated vegetable acids pufas were touted with a broad brush but in the ensuing years researchers have come to understand that not all pufas are alike with key biochemical differences and perhaps varying cardiovascular impacts observed among multiple types of omega s found in fish oils and omega linoleic acids there is more than one type of polyunsaturated fatty acid explained dr christopher ramsden who headed the re analysis and is a clinical investigator with the laboratory of membrane biophysics and biochemistry at the national institute on alcohol abuse and alcoholism part of the u s national institutes of health and so we were interested in trying to evaluate just one of these compounds linoleic acid by looking at this old trial using modern statistical methods and also by re including some original data that had gone missing from the first analysis ramsden explained the findings appeared online feb in the bmj the male participants in the original study had been between the ages of and at enrollment and all had a history of heart disease with most having survived a heart attack the men were placed into two groups the first group was told to consume linoleic acid in the form of safflower oil and safflower oil polyunsaturated margarine at levels equal to percent of total calorie intake this said ramsden is equivalent to roughly twice the amount that americans currently consume while omega consumption was not affected the men were also asked to lower their saturated fat intake so that it made up less than percent of their diets they did so by substituting safflower oil for animal fats common margarines and shortening oils salad dressings baked goods and other products according to the study the second group continued their routine nutritional habits and both groups kept food diaries and underwent regular assessments during the three year plus study period by newly crunching all the original data the nih team found that compared to the no dietary change group the linoleic acid group faced a higher risk of death from both heart disease specifically as well as from all causes overall in turn ramsden s investigators included their sydney conclusions in a new review of all studies to date exploring the impact of omega consumption despite the fact the american heart association aha currently recommends that percent to percent of all calories come from polyunsaturated fat principally from omega the nih team found no evidence to support the notion that linoleic acid confers health benefits the review highlighted the possibility that boosting omega consumption may actually increase the risk for developing heart disease ramsden acknowledged that the sydney study had been narrowly focused on a specific group of people middle aged men with a history of heart disease who were asked to consume linoleic acid in quantities far exceeding both aha guidelines and the dietary habits of most americans so yes one of the limitations of this kind of study is always the question of its generalizability to other populations he cautioned but he also suggested that his team s rigorous look back offered valuable insights into how nutritional science has evolved what to many people had at one time seemed pretty straightforward in the s has turned out to form a much less black and white picture he said polyunsaturates are not just involved in cholesterol lowering they may also be involved in inflammation oxidation or clotting so it s a very complex picture and though our goal is not to come up with diet advice it may be that our conclusions will have important implications for nutritional guidelines on that score american heart association spokesperson penny kris etherton a registered dietician and professor of nutrition at pennsylvania state university suggested that the controversy concerning linoleic acid is not new and will continue but i don t think this is going to change aha recommendations she said because there s very robust evidence showing the cardiovascular benefit of linoleic acid the aha science advisory board did not just look at one study or a couple of studies there are lots of studies that form the basis for their guidelines so i don t think anybody should get alarmed and change their diet kris etherton said those who are concerned should wait for more research to come out on this topic before taking any drastic measures to change their eating habits in a way that could be harmful more information for more on aha guidelines regarding

getty images yoga does the body good and according to a new study it may ease the mind as well yoga has also become such a cultural phenomenon that it has become difficult for physicians and consumers to differentiate legitimate claims from hype researchers from duke university medical center write in their study published in the journal frontiers in psychiatry in order to explore the widely held belief that practicing yoga can relieve mental stress the team reviewed more than studies on the effect of yoga and mental health most individuals already know that yoga produces some kind of a calming effect individually people feel better after doing the physical exercise says lead study author dr p murali doraiswamy a professor of psychiatry and medicine at duke university medical center mentally people feel calmer sharper maybe more content we thought it s time to see if we could pull all the literature together to see if there s enough evidence that the benefits individual people notice can be used to help people with mental illness more yoga can help stroke survivors regain their balance their findings suggest that yoga does in fact have positive effects on mild depression and sleep problems and it improves the symptoms of psychiatric disorders like schizophrenia and adhd among patients using medication the researchers focused on studies that recorded the effects of practicing yoga on mental health issues ranging from depression schizophrenia adhd sleep complaints and eating disorders to cognitive problems they found positive effects of the mind and body practice for all conditions with the exception of eating disorders and cognition those studies involved too few participants or produced conflicting results to draw any meaningful conclusions some of the studies included in the analysis even suggested that yoga might affect the body in ways similar to antidepressants and psychotherapy for instance yoga may influence brain chemicals known as neurotransmitters boosting levels of feel good agents like serotonin lower inflammation reduce oxidative stress and produce a healthier balance of lipids and growth factors just as other forms of exercise do more we tried this aerial vinyasa or upside down yoga embracing yoga as a complementary treatment for mental disorders is not uncommon yoga is a feature in many veterans centers throughout the country backed by research funded by the department of veterans affairs the huffington post reported that many troops use yoga as a form of treatment for ptsd for example with companies like warriors at ease training instructors in yoga techniques specifically catered to those in the military a study published earlier this month of active duty troops found daily yoga eased anxiety and improved sleep the researchers say there s enough evidence to warrant a larger study on the effects of yoga on mental health and it should be considered as part of treatment for more disorders many millions of americans are doing yoga and many millions of americans have mental illnesses and are popping psychiatric pills daily despite all of this the vast majority of studies looking at the benefits of yoga are all small studies we did not come across a single study where there was a coordinated effort done by some large agency to really conduct a large national study says doraiswamy more does yoga really drive people wild with desire but while the research is promising yoga likely won t be a panacea for mental illness nor should patients try to replace their medications with the practice what we are saying is that we still need to do further large scale studies before we are ready to conclude that people with mental illnesses can turn to yoga as a first line treatment says doraiswamy we are not saying throw away your prozac and turn to yoga we re saying it has the promise and potential if a large national study were done it could turn out that yoga is just as good and may be a low cost alternative to people with unmet needs in the meantime he says it doesn t hurt to add yoga to existing treatments so patients can take advantage of any potential benefits,1
by kathleen doheny healthday reporter monday jan healthday news breast conserving surgery for early stage breast cancers may result in better survival than mastectomy according to a new study for those with early stage breast cancer lumpectomy is just as effective if not more effective than mastectomy said researcher dr shelley hwang chief of breast surgery at duke cancer institute in durham n c there are lots of women who think the more treatment they do the better they will do she said this refutes that the findings published online jan in the journal cancer are especially strong for women over with hormone sensitive cancers the researchers found earlier research had also concluded that the two procedures are similarly effective but hwang s is a more real world study hwang s team looked at years of data from the california cancer registry following more than women with early stage breast cancer stages or between and ages ranged from to more than half percent had lumpectomy and radiation while percent had mastectomy complete breast removal alone hwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone not mastectomy plus radiation we wanted to look at early stage disease and those patients typically don t get radiation after mastectomy she said the researchers tracked the women s progress for a median of more than nine years half followed longer half less during that time more than women died nearly percent of them from breast cancer the others died of other causes for the first three years after treatment those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy this may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier hwang said over the entire follow up those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer the group that benefited the most who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival were those women over with estrogen receptor positive disease hwang said this means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow among those women the lumpectomy group had a percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy not all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy hwang said in this procedure just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed sparing the rest of the breast among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large or those who have different cancers in the same breast the percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently after a dip in previous years hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it the new research which was funded by the u s national cancer institute suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible it may actually increase survival hwang said the findings may reverse the mastectomy trend said dr laura kruper co director of the breast oncology program at the city of hope comprehensive cancer center in duarte calif who was not involved in the study the study is scientifically sound in many ways kruper said they broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category she said they looked at socioeconomic status and they kept it early stage dr wendy woodward section chief for breast radiation oncology at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in houston said that for women with early cancers the study clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast conserving surgery candidates but woodward added i am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival but it may be the study was observational hwang stressed it found a link or association but could not provide cause and effect proof that the breast conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer hwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information however i don t want women who chose mastectomy to think they did the wrong thing hwang said at the end of the day personal preference trumps everything else i fully support the patient s options to choose the best treatment for themselves more information to learn more about lumpectomy visit the american cancer society,1

getty images the benefits for the heart of eating strawberries and blueberries can build up over a lifetime according to the latest research bright colored berries have long been a part of any healthy diet owing mainly to the anthocyanins that give them their vibrant color and act as antioxidants to fight off damage to cells now a study published in the journal circulation confirms and quantifies that benefit women who ate three or more servings of blueberries and strawberries per week reduced their risk of heart attack by up to one third in the study researchers from the harvard school of public health and the university of east anglia in the u k analyzed data from women ages to enrolled in the nurses health study ii for years the women filled out surveys detailing their diets at four year intervals more study flavonoids may help protect against parkinson s during the study the women experienced heart attacks but women who consumed the most blueberries and strawberries had a reduced risk of heart attack compared with the women who ate berries once a month or less the women who ate more berries also tended to eat healthier overall consuming more vegetables and fruits than those who didn t eat as many berries but when the scientists broke down the women s diets they found that the highest consumers of berries even had a lower risk of heart attack compared with women who still ate plenty of fruits and vegetables but fewer berries the effect remained even after the researchers adjusted for other things that can influence heart disease risk such as obesity high blood pressure smoking low levels of physical activity and a family history of heart disease these foods can be readily incorporated into diets and simple dietary changes could have an impact in reducing risk of heart disease in younger women says study author aedin cassidy from the university of east anglia this supports growing lab data showing that these compounds can help keep arteries healthy and flexible so what is it about berries that help the heart the researchers focused on blueberries and strawberries because these are the most widely consumed varieties in the u s both berries contain high levels of anthocyanins as well as other flavonoids which fight the effects of stress and free radical damage to cells as they age they can also keep heart vessels more elastic and flexible which helps combat the growth of plaques that can build up and rupture causing heart attacks more can eating fruits and veggies outwit bad heart genes the results are particularly encouraging because they showed that a change in diet could affect heart disease risk for relatively young women that means that regular consumption of berries might be a relatively easy way to lower a woman s risk of having a heart attack later in life possibly even insulating her from heart problems although we know about the effects of antioxidants and flavonoids and their effects in wine and chocolate it is interesting to look at their effects in such a large group of women over a long period of time says dr suzanne steinbaum director of women and heart disease at lenox hill hospital in new york city who was not involved in the study the take home lesson is that even if you are eating these early in life you re getting benefits that last for life when we re making choices in our s we may think that a burger and fries is great but the message is that there are alternatives that make a difference for the rest of your life it is a powerful message that we can prevent cardiovascular disease by what we eat something worth remembering the next time you re in the produce aisle,1

drug fulfills promise of research into cystic fibrosis gene toggle caption jeffrey sauger the promise of genetic medicine is beginning to be fulfilled but it s been a long hard slog take the story of kalydeco it s designed to treat people with a lung disease called cystic fibrosis while not quite a cure the drug is extremely effective for some cf patients but the success of kalydeco has been more than two decades in the making a good starting point for the story is aug that s the day scientists from the u s and canada announced the discovery of the gene associated with the disease it was the early days of gene hunting and the cf gene was a big prize cf is the most common genetic disease in caucasians when people inherit a damaged form of the cf gene a critical protein inside cells doesn t work properly as a result sticky mucus builds up in a patient s lungs causing infections and making it hard to breathe the announcement was supposed to be made in conjunction with three papers in the sept issue of science but a reporter for reuters got hold of the story early science took the unusual step of allowing the scientists to speak to the media before publication at the time scientists predicted that a genetic test for cf was just around the corner but they also thought a drug to treat the disease was in reach the first prediction turned out to be right but it wasn t until years later that we were able to find drugs that directly target the underlying cause of cystic fibrosis says fred van goor who led the team at what is now vertex pharmaceuticals that developed kalydeco so it was a long time between the discovery of the gene and the discovery of kalyedco toggle caption vertex pharmaceuticals inc it took awhile to find a drug that would help restore the function of the protein the cf gene makes we tested over chemicals in cells with the defective protein that causes cystic fibrosis says van goor one of those chemicals ultimately became a successful drug but it had to be modified so patients could take it by mouth and so it would last the right length of time in a patient s body from the start van goor and his colleagues knew there was a problem with kalydeco it only works on a small subset of people with cf they have to have a particular mutation in the cf gene or the drug is of little use but for people who do have that mutation the drug works remarkably well emily schaller was in one of the early studies of kalydeco as part of the study researchers first gave her a placebo then switched her to the active drug she knew within days that something was different i was with my brother in florida and we were walking down the street and i took a deep breath and when i took a deep breath in and i let it out i didn t cough says schaller but not only did i not cough but i felt that my lungs were clear and that something huge had happened it was just something i had never felt in my life before schaller isn t cured she still has a damaged cf gene the only way to fix that would be gene therapy where a healthy form of the gene would supplant the damaged one although it seems simple in theory in practice gene therapy has been incredibly difficult to accomplish schaller isn t particularly bothered by that everyone talks about curing a disease cure cf cure these other diseases but kalydeco controls cf at the basic defect so i m ok with the other c word control because i m living it and i ve never felt better in my life the time from gene discovery to successful drug may be shortening but there are only a handful of successful drugs so far and for a while at least the appearance of new ones will be slow they re also likely to be expensive kalydeco costs in the neighborhood of per year,1

influence medical practice the study involved an estrogen blocking pill called tamoxifen a standard therapy for the roughly two thirds of breast cancer patients whose tumors are sensitive to estrogen taking tamoxifen for five years after diagnosis reduces breast cancer mortality by about one third in the new study women with early tumors who took tamoxifen for years cut their risk of dying from breast cancer by another compared to women who stopped after five years in absolute terms of women on tamoxifen for years died of breast cancer within five to years after diagnosis compared to of those who stopped at five years overall women who take tamoxifen for a decade cut their risk of dying from breast cancer nearly in half compared with those who don t take it at all says study co author richard gray of the university of oxford in the united kingdom that s significant given that tamoxifen is used by hundreds of thousands of women worldwide says gray whose study was presented wednesday at the annual san antonio breast cancer symposium oxford funded the study which included more than women from countries while tamoxifen delays tumor growth in some women it appears to cure others gray says this is a dream come true for women says v craig jordan a researcher who led tamoxifen s development but who wasn t involved in the new study it s very exciting tamoxifen which has been used for decades is far cheaper than most new chemotherapies and biological drugs which cost thousands of dollars a month a generic version costs about a month in the usa according to susan g komen for the cure in the u k tamoxifen costs only a month in india it s cents a pill says jordan scientific director at georgetown s lombardi comprehensive cancer center jordan says the new findings will quickly change care for some patients younger women with more aggressive tumors may want to extend their tamoxifen use says jennifer litton an assistant professor at m d anderson cancer center in houston who wasn t involved in the study tamoxifen is the only hormonal option for women before menopause litton says doctors may not want to change the care of older patients however she says that s because postmenopausal women have the option of tamoxifen or another class of hormonal therapies called aromatase inhibitors or ais these drugs are slightly more effective than tamoxifen although they don t work before menopause litton says because the study didn t include ais doctors can t say how whether tamoxifen would benefit women who ve taken them litton says other researchers are conducting trials comparing five versus years of ais although these results won t be out for several years gray noted that tamoxifen has risks in his study doubling the length of treament also doubled the risk of endometrial cancer which affects the uterine lining to about however because this cancer is very treatable death rates were low of those on tamoxifen for years died of endometrial cancer compared to of those taking it for five years doctors saw no increase in strokes which has long been a concern with tamoxifen gray says breast cancer survivors have mixed reactions to the results some women will be glad to have another treament option says breast cancer survivor lillie shockney administrative director of the johns hopkins cancer survivorhip program in baltimore patients get very nervous when they stop any hormonal therapy because they feel like now they aren t doing anything says shockney the opportunity to do something might be appealing despite the side effects shockney says she d like to see research on other ways to prevent recurrences such as weight loss if someone lost pounds would that do as much as another five years on tamoxifen shockney asks some patients may be reluctant to prolong their use of a drug that causes so many side effects says boston breast cancer survivor alicia staley studies show that only of women take tamoxifen for five years litton says some switch to an ai although these drugs can also cause problems such as joint pain and osteoporosis staley say she tamoxifen gave her many many side effects including severe hot flashes dry eyes joint pain weight gain you name it i had it she says after ½ years staley and her doctor stopped the drug to regain a measure of quality of life for shockney tamoxifen took a heavy toll on her marriage causing dryness that made sex unbearably painful patients and their partners need to have honest talks with doctors about how extended treatment will affect their relationship she says if we are going to look at giving women tamoxifen for years by golly we better get the partners involved shockney says yet shockney says her husband of nearly years would have wanted her to do everything possible to survive if someone said to my husband i know this has been a rough road for you and a big impact on your sex life but if she stays on it another five years it could affect her survival he would have said please please take the pill,1

en español wednesday nov healthday news patients with rheumatoid arthritis are more likely to suffer hip dislocation after hip replacement surgery than those with osteoarthritis a new study says in addition rheumatoid arthritis patients have a higher infection risk after total knee replacement than osteoarthritis patients the study authors found rheumatoid arthritis which is felt throughout the whole body is caused when a person s immune system attacks his or her own tissues osteoarthritis which is usually felt only in the joints is caused by wear and tear on the body for the study the investigators analyzed the findings of studies published between january and december the studies included arthritis patients aged or older who had hip or knee replacements the findings are published in the nov online edition of arthritis rheumatism joint arthroplasty is successful in relieving the pain and disability caused by hip or knee arthritis study author dr bheeshma ravi from the university of toronto and women s college research institute said in a journal news release while complication rates are low there are some cases with serious consequences that include infection joint dislocation blood clots and even death the study team found no differences between the two groups of arthritis patients in rates of follow up surgery or day blood clot or death risk rheumatoid arthritis affects about million people in the united states while osteoarthritis affects million americans aged and older according to the american college of rheumatology more information the u s national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases has more about hip replacement,0
nov researchers say they ve been able to use nanoparticles to stop multiple sclerosis ms in mice that are bred to have the disease the particles are about times smaller than the thickness of a human hair they are made from the same material that s used to create dissolving stitches when researchers attach specific proteins to the particles they say they re able to teach the body not to attack its own tissues if the approach succeeds in human studies it may one day lead to more targeted treatments not only for multiple sclerosis but also for other kinds of autoimmune disorders including type diabetes and rheumatoid arthritis this technology could be very effective says timothy coetzee phd chief research officer for the national multiple sclerosis society what remains to be seen is whether the researchers have picked the right proteins that might turn off the disease in humans he says will these peptides actually induce tolerance in people we just don t know it s rational but we won t know until we get it into people says coetzee who was not involved in the research the research is published in the journal nature biotechnology the study was funded by grants from the national institutes of health the myelin repair foundation the juvenile diabetes foundation and the australian government,1
researchers trying to find a way to treat multiple sclerosis think they ve come up with an approach that could not only help patients with ms but those with a range of so called autoimmune diseases from type diabetes to psoriasis and perhaps even food allergies so far it s only worked in mice but it has worked especially well and while mice are different from humans in many ways their immune systems are quite similar if this works it is going to be absolutely fantastic said bill heetderks who directs outside research at the national institute of biomedical imaging and bioengineering part of the national institutes of health which helped pay for the research even if it doesn t work it s going to be another step down the road in autoimmune disease the body s immune cells mistakenly attack and destroy healthy tissue in ms it s the fatty protective sheath around the nerves in type or juvenile diabetes it s cells in the pancreas that make insulin in rheumatoid arthritis it s tissue in the joint currently the main treatment is to suppress the immune system an approach that can leave patients vulnerable to infections and cancer the new treatment re educates the immune cells so they stop the attacks the approach uses tiny little balls called nanoparticles made of the same material used to make surgical sutures that dissolve harmlessly in the body they re attached to little bits of the protein that the immune cells are attacking the researchers report in sunday s issue of the journal nature biotechnology stephen miller of the northwestern university feinberg school of medicine in chicago had been trying a slightly different approach to treating ms when normal cells die naturally through a self destruction process called apoptosis immune cells called macrophages come in and eat up the mess the macrophages are carried to the spleen where they show these ground up bits of cells to other immune cells called t cells it s a kind of introduction that familiarizes the t cells with the body s normal cells then t cells know not to attack healthy cells miller s team had been trying to find ways to use this process to re educate the t cells they have been attaching bits of the myelin that t cells mistakenly attack to healthy cells from ms patients that were self destructing then infusing the concoction back into ms patients the idea would be to introduce the myelin to the t cells at the same time they were meeting the healthy tissue and educate them to leave the myelin alone so far the team has only shown the process is safe a phase clinical trial but miller says the experiment also seemed to show they were beginning to repair the patients immune systems however it was hideously expensive it cost probably about a million dollars to treat patients using live cells he said obviously the researchers needed something cheaper miller got together with lonnie shea a professor of chemical and biological engineering at northwestern they substituted cheap little balls of plastic called polystyrene nanoparticles for the self destructing cells these new nanoparticles stopped the course of a ms like disease in mice the researchers found but polystyrene is no good to use in people it doesn t break down and contains a compound styrene that may cause cancer shea had another possibility called poly lactide co glycolide or plg for short it turns out this is an fda approved substance that is used in resorbable sutures said miller there is nothing rare or exotic or strange here said nibib s heetderks the particles are easy to produce he said this worked just as well in mice it only takes an hour in a chemical bath to attach little bits of myelin to the nanoparticles of plg when infused into a vein they re carried by the blood right to the spleen where the nanoparticles meet the t cells if the treatment was done as soon as the mice had their first ms like attack the attacks stopped the effects lasted for the entire lives of the mice miller said what s great about the approach miller says is that it can be used to treat any autoimmune disease for diabetes little bits of pancreatic beta cells could be attached to the nanoparticles for a food allergy the part of the food that causes the allergic response could be attached you can try to induce tolerance to peanuts or eggs or shellfish or whatever you are allergic to he said one shortcoming is that scientists don t always know what s causing an autoimmune disease we know that in rheumatoid arthritis your joints get attacked but what we don t know really well is what specific protein in your joints is being attacked we really need to know that before we can apply this therapy miller said now the researchers are looking for funding so they can test this new approach in people they re in discussions with the juvenile diabetes research foundation to test it in people with type diabetes and the myelin repair foundation to test it in ms patients miller said they may form their own company to develop it as a medical treatment something that would be years away mice don t live very long and it s not clear if human patients would need repeat treatments but the t cells that are re educated usually live for a long time in the body and have long memories miller said it s also clear the approach would not repair any damage already done by the disease so the best candidates would be patients having their very first symptoms but it might be possible down the road to combine the nanoparticle treatment with another treatment to replace the damaged tissue in more advanced patients miller said related stories new drug may help ms approach turns off peanut allergies can pot smoking ease ms symptoms,1
most doctors say meditation can t hurt you but now there s reassuring evidence that it may help you as well when it comes to warding off disease nicolas hansen getty images most doctors say meditation can t hurt you but now there s reassuring evidence that it may help you as well when it comes to warding off disease previous studies have linked better health outcomes among heart patients who practiced meditation compared to those who did not but none of those trials could definitively credit the brain focusing program with the better health results in the latest trial to address those limitations however meditation does appear to have an effect on reducing heart attack stroke and even early death from heart disease at least among african americans more losing focus studies say meditation may help the main finding of our research is that added on top of usual medical care intervention with a mind body technique transcendental meditation can have a major effect on cardiovascular events says robert schneider lead author on the study published in circulation cardiovascular quality and outcomes and a professor at the maharishi university of management an institution in iowa that was founded by the creator of transcendental meditation he and his colleagues followed african american men and women who are at higher risk of heart disease than whites but who also had addition reason to worry about heart attacks and strokes since they were also diagnosed with coronary heart disease the participants were randomly assigned to participate in either a health education class about heart friendly diet and exercise or to attend a transcendental meditation program transcendental meditation involves shutting out the outside world and focusing thoughts inward or resting while remaining alert all of the participants continued to receive their normal medical care as well including appropriate medication more medical meditation say om before surgery after roughly five years of follow up the researchers found a reduction in the overall risk of heart attack stroke and death from any cause among members of the meditation group compared to those from the health education group the meditating group enjoyed an average drop of mm hg in systolic blood pressure compared to the control group and also reported less stress and less anger it s like discovering a whole new class of medications schneider says of the power of meditation in improving the patients health but while the magnitude of those results is remarkable the study involved a relatively small number of participants and did not reveal how meditation may be lowering heart disease risk on the surface it s intuitively obvious that stress management can affect heart health for the better anxiety and stress cause blood pressure to shoot up and leave us on edge triggering spikes in heart harming stress hormones like cortisol but many experts are skeptical of the alleged benefits of techniques such as transcendental meditation that claim to reduce stress by a substantial amount in the past these benefits have been hard to test scientifically largely because study participants who volunteered for meditation programs may have been biased to see them succeed practitioners have also made strong and essentially unsubstantiated claims about the powers of meditation leading heart experts and scientists to be especially skeptical in fact in more than brain researchers signed a petition albeit an unsuccessful one to protest a scheduled lecture on the neuroscience of meditation by the buddhist spiritual icon the dalai lama at a major conference organized by the society for neuroscience more mind over matter can zen meditation help you forget about pain the great lengths to which the researchers of the circulation study went to make their trial scientifically rigorous however should reinforce the results in the eyes of some skeptics the scientists adjusted for the effects of weight smoking behavior and diet all of which can influence heart attack stroke and early heart death rates and while the participants in both groups exercised more and cut back on alcohol during the study they did so at similar rates making these changes unlikely to be responsible for the differences in health outcomes either while the findings aren t likely to resolve questions over whether meditation should become a standard part of heart disease care the results should give more doctors confidence in discussing the practice with their patients and giving them some scientifically based information that s an improvement over the advice that it can t hurt to try video practicing meditation for female pleasure,1

en español monday oct healthday news a large amount of beta amyloid or plaques in the brain may trigger more significant memory loss in healthy older people than the genetic risk factor associated with alzheimer s disease known as the apoe ɛ allele according to new research from australia our finding that brain plaque related memory decline can occur while people still have normal memory and thinking shows that these plaque related brain changes can be detected and measured while older people are still healthy said study author yen ying lim of the university of melbourne this provides an enormous opportunity for understanding the development of early alzheimer s disease and even a sound basis for the assessment of plaque targeting therapies the researchers had nearly older adults with no thinking or memory problems undergo a pet brain scan the participants who were an average age of also were tested for the apoe gene the group s brain function was monitored for months using computer based tests card games and having the participants memorize word lists the study results are published in the oct issue of the journal neurology over the course of the study the people who began with more brain plaques had up to percent greater decline on the computer based assessments of memory than the people who had fewer brain plaques the researchers also found the participants who carried the apoe gene had greater memory loss than those who did not have this genetic risk factor they noted however that carrying the gene did not affect memory decline associated with the plaques our results show that plaques may be a more important factor in determining which people are at greater risk for cognitive impairment or other memory diseases such as alzheimer s disease lim said in a journal news release unfortunately testing for the apoe genotype is easier and much less costly than conducting amyloid imaging although the researchers discovered an association between plaques and increased memory loss they did not prove a cause and effect relationship more information the u s national institute on aging provides more information on alzheimer s disease,0

a widely anticipated study suggests that hormone therapy started soon after menopause can ease depression anxiety hot flashes and other adverse symptoms that many women face without increasing risks for cardiovascular disease there was no increase in breast cancer stroke heart attack or blood clots but the study s researchers said the sample size was too small and the study time too short to draw firm conclusions the preliminary findings presented wednesday at a conference of the north american menopause society in orlando fla were in starkcontrast to those of the women s health initiative that much larger government funded study of hormone therapy was halted in because the risks of heart disease and stroke seemed to outweigh the benefits those findings had sparked concern among women who turn to hormone therapy to alleviate the symptoms of menopause the women in the whi were older on average years old and largely a decade or more past menopause and critics suggested women closer to menopause might get more benefit with less harm nevertheless use of estrogen and progesterone in the u s dropped by more than half between and according to ims health a health care technology and information company the new study will be reassuring to many people who were anxious about using estrogen for short term therapy particularly health care providers who were nervous about their patients taking this said mary jane minkin a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at yale university school of medicine one of the study s eight sites the trial known as keeps for kronos early estrogen prevention study was funded by the kronos longevity research institute a nonprofit organization in phoenix that conducts research on age related diseases the four year randomized placebo controlled trial enrolled women aged to who were within three years of the onset of menopause they received either a low dose estrogen pill one made with horse estrogen or a skin patch one with estradiol made from plants but closer to what women s bodies make or a placebo women on estrogen also took a natural progesterone the whi used a synthetic form neither type of estrogen had any significant impact on blood pressure coronary calcium levels or atherosclerosis as measured by ultrasounds of the carotid artery key markers of cardiovascular health researchers speculated that was because the women were generally healthy and yet at an age where such problems are rare women taking estrogen in pill form had an increase in hdl or good cholesterol and a decrease in ldl or bad cholesterol but an increase in triglycerides women on the patch had an improvement in insulin sensitivity making them less likely to develop type diabetes women on both forms of estrogen reported fewer hot flashes night sweats and mood swings as well as an improvement in bone density a second branch of the study funded by the national institute of aging found that estrogen in pill form but not the patch improved symptoms of depression anxiety and tension without causing memory or cognitive ability which the whi had found in older women researchers said those findings underscored the need for women and their doctors to make individual decisions about whether to go on hormone therapy and if so which kind a woman who has low hdl cholesterol and borderline high ldl and has some mood symptoms might find some advantages on the oral estrogen whereas a woman who has high risk for type diabetes some excess weight might benefit from the skin patch form said joann manson chief of preventive medicine at brigham and women s hospital in boston and one of the lead keeps researchers the researchers who haven t yet submitted the findings for publication plan more analysis on the impact of hormone therapy on breast density they also say they hope to continue monitoring the participants for any future effects on heart disease cancer or cognitive function whether they continue to take hormones or not margery gass executive director of the menopause society and who wasn t involved in keeps said it confirmed her group s view on hormone therapy there seems to be very small risks for healthy women at menopause but there is no strong evidence that women should be taking it long term write to melinda beck at,1
a new detailed mammography exam catches more cancers while causing fewer false alarms according to the company that sells it the downside some physicians say is that it costs more and delivers twice as much radiation as traditional mammograms tomosynthesis or three dimensional mammography has been available in the u s since february from hologic inc bedford mass in just a few months radiologists say they are finding cancers they would have missed with the standard exam others though urge caution we really have to wait for the scientific evidence says barbara monsees who heads the american college of radiology s breast imaging commission adding that the technology looks promising many digital mammogram centers are increasingly offering the option of paying a supplement out of pocket for a d image standard mammograms miss to of tumors in part because small ones can be hidden behind tissue we discuss with robert cascella ceo of hologic which manufactures a d mammography machine photo hologic a study of some women now under way by an international team of researchers and partially funded by hologic is examining whether d mammography finds more cancers preliminary results presented at a scientific meeting in november showed a increase in cancer detection but no conclusion can be drawn until the full results are published in a peer reviewed journal says dr monsees the american cancer society recommends women get annual mammograms starting at years old a d mammography machine is similar those used for standard d mammography but instead of taking just top and side pictures of each breast the x ray arm of a d machine moves in an arc and collects detailed data used to create or razor thin slices for each view the d scans show what breast tissue looks like at various depths radiologists say they can now see tumors that would have been obscured by surrounding tissue i think we re going to find more cancers at an earlier stage says liane philpotts chief of breast imaging at yale school of medicine in new haven conn adding that one recent tumor difficult to see on a standard exam jumped right out at us on a d scan the benefit is particularly noticeable in women with dense breasts in which tumors can be hard to see but the d exam produces better results in all women she says the new exam will likely save lives by finding cancers earlier and give women more options such as skipping chemotherapy or getting a lighter dose says laurie margolies director of breast imaging at mount sinai medical center in new york dr margolies has briefly consulted for hologic but has no continuing relationship with the company in addition to finding more tumors early experience shows the d exam may reduce anxiety producing recalls in which women are told to return for a diagnostic work up after the mammogram looks unclear or concerning recalls are mostly false alarms in a woman study at yale university the recall rate of women screened with d and d mammography combined was compared with for d alone the full exam typically includes a standard d view as well as a d one and has a patient under compression for a total of about seconds compared with for a standard exam hologic says insurance often doesn t cover the d portion so doctors say you often need to pay about out of pocket the d exam is done in part to aid in comparing results with earlier scans hologic says the combination exam delivers milligray of radiation per exam around double what is given during a standard exam on hologic d machines the company says the double radiation dose could potentially cause cancer in in women who get d mammography annually from age until instead of the standard exam according to the food and drug administration the more detailed exam will save lives overall over the d scan if at least more cancers are detected which appears likely from preliminary data says peter soltani senior vice president of breast health at hologic he adds that small amounts of radiation from mammography have never been proven to cause cancer hologic has applied to the fda for approval to market a technology that would synthesize a d image from detail taken in the d sweep and which physicians say would significantly lower the radiation because you d only have to take one set of images instead of two general electric co is also applying to the fda for permission to market a d mammography machine the company declined to say when it expects a decision email,1
monday oct healthday news a new anti clotting drug called apixaban was better than warfarin at preventing stroke in patients with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation a new study found data from more than patients also found that apixaban was safer overall than warfarin and tended to cause less bleeding in the skull in patients who faced the highest risk of bleeding the findings suggest that the current risk scoring systems for tailoring anti clotting anticoagulant treatment to individual patients may be less relevant when using apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for stroke according to the duke university medical center researchers the benefits of apixaban are preserved regardless of the risk score used and regardless of the patient risk category study author and cardiologist dr renato lopes said in a duke news release with new oral anticoagulants such as apixaban we might not need risk scores to guide treatment decisions for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation this may simplify how physicians make decisions and also improve patient care study co investigator dr jack ansell agreed this analysis provides further support for the benefit of apixaban but given the very low risk of bleeding with apixaban it also suggests that the current stroke and bleeding risk scores may not be sensitive enough to tease out those patients with the very lowest risk of stroke who might benefit from apixaban therapy said ansell who is chairman of the department of medicine at lenox hill hospital in new york city and a consultant to bristol myers squibb and pfizer the companies that are marketing the drug as eliquis the drug has not yet been approved by the u s food and drug administration the study was published online oct in the lancet apixaban showed a percent relative reduction in the incidence of strokes or systemic embolisms clots when compared to warfarin a percent relative reduction in major bleeding and an percent relative reduction in overall mortality the researchers found atrial fibrillation affects more than million people in the united states in people with atrial fibrillation disorganized electrical activity causes ineffective contraction of the upper chambers of the heart this increases the risk for blood clots that can cause stroke current practice guidelines permit the use of either anti clotting therapy with aspirin or warfarin aspirin is less effective than warfarin but carries a lower risk of bleeding for patients with atrial fibrillation and one risk factor for stroke more information the u s national heart lung and blood institute has more about atrial fibrillation,0
saturday sept healthday news researchers say they ve discovered a two drug combination that delays treatment resistance in patients with advanced melanoma by targeting different points in the same growth factor pathway the kinase inhibitor drugs dabrafenib and trametinib postponed the development of drug resistance in patients with braf positive metastatic melanoma the study authors said melanoma is the most serious and often deadly form of skin cancer in about half of patients with melanoma that has spread tumor growth is caused by genetic mutations that keep the braf protein part of the mapk cell growth pathway constantly activated drugs that inhibit braf activity can rapidly stop and reverse tumor growth in about percent of patients but the response is temporary in most cases and tumor growth resumes in six or seven months the researchers explained previous research suggested that this drug resistance develops because the mapk pathway gets turned back on through activation of mek another protein that is part off the mapk pathway we investigated this drug combination because of research we and others have conducted into the molecular underpinnings of resistance to braf inhibitor therapy study lead author dr keith flaherty of the massachusetts general hospital cancer center said in a hospital news release the phase and study was sponsored by glaxosmithkline which developed both drugs we found that adding the mek inhibitor trametinib to braf inhibitor dabrafenib clearly delays the emergence of resistance in fact the combination was at least twice as effective as braf inhibition alone he said one expert agreed that the results were encouraging this study addresses the problem of resistance to the mitogen activated protein kinase mapk pathway this study combined dabrafenib a selective braf inhibitor and trametinib a selective mapk kinase mek inhibitor these drugs can be safely combined and the survival was significantly improved without untoward side effects said dr michele green a dermatologist at lenox hill hospital in new york city the study was conducted at sites in the united states and australia and included patients who received different dose combinations of the drugs two daily milligram mg doses of dabrafenib plus one mg dose of trametinib the same dabrafenib dose with a mg dose of trametinib or treatment with dabrafenib alone patients who received dabrafenib alone were able to receive the full dose combination treatment if their cancer resumed progression treatment with both combinations of dabrafenib and trametinib led to a four month longer delay in drug resistance than treatment with dabrafenib alone after one year of treatment percent of patients receiving the full dose combination treatment had no progression of their melanoma compared with percent of those receiving dabrafenib alone among patients receiving the combination treatment the development of side effects such as skin rash and a less dangerous type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma was similar to that typically seen in patients taking only one of the drugs the study was scheduled for presentation saturday at the european society for medical oncology meeting in vienna and simultaneous publication in the new england journal of medicine the drug combination is now being tested in a larger phase study which is required for u s food and drug administration approval more information the american cancer society has more about melanoma,1
for men diagnosed with prostate cancer the decision about how to treat it or even whether to treat it can be agonizing surgery radiation or some combination of both may lead to miserable side effects such incontinence impotence and rectal damage doctors usually can t predict whether a man will suffer all or none of those side effects while some risk factors are well known including age diabetes and poor cardiovascular health whether a man suffers harsh side effects is often chalked up to random luck so what if it were possible to know before treatment which men might be more likely to suffer complications new research published thursday in the international journal of radiation oncology discovered a set of genetic markers that appear to indicate a significantly greater risk of collateral damage from radiation treatment for prostate cancer knowing a man s susceptibility to fallout from radiation may steer a doctor toward surgery instead of other potentially damaging therapy more often than not it s not clear cut which way to go explained barry rosenstein professor of radiation oncology at mt sinai school of medicine in new york city if you see a surgeon he s likely to say surgery is best if you see a radiation oncologist he ll say oncology determining what type of treatment a man should receive is only part of the dilemma of prostate cancer the debate whether to even test for it is ongoing this early stage study represents a big step toward doctors and their patients making that decision the researchers started with a pool of men treated with radiation for prostate cancer patients were assessed every three to six months for signs of sexual dysfunction for up to five years the number of men studied was eventually winnowed down to patients with erectile dysfunction and controls the scientists then performed dna analyses on the men looking for genetic variations called single nucleotide polymorphisms or snps pronounced snips slight differences in the spelling of our dna after sifting through hundreds of thousands of snps they settled on suspect genetic variations it turned out that when the snps were combined to create a score that could be used to measure individual risk of treatment complications having just one of the snps more than doubled the risk the more of the a man had the greater his chances of radiation therapy complications it is cumulative rosenstein explained if a man has five or six it increases his chances quite a bit the research is still in the early stages so doctors aren t likely to be using the genetic markers to determine treatment any time soon this is still not nearly good enough yet he said but he s part of an international consortium that is trying to make that very scenario a practical reality the next step he said is for group members to validate the predictive power of the markers his team found if they can then doctors really will be able to assign patients to treatments and see if we maintain the same level of control of cancer and lower the incidence of complications he said and if we can do that then there ll be enough confidence to put it into use in the clinic even better he suggested it may one day be possible to use drugs to target the snips or the biological processes they influence as a way to prevent damage from therapy that hope is evident to other researchers such as dr ithaar derweesh a urologic oncologist and associate professor of surgery at the university of california san diego moores cancer center this is a study that in certain ways is groundbreaking and also elegantly performed derweesh said while derweesh agreed with rosenstein that such a technique will take time to validate and be used to steer patients toward a particular therapy something he called the holy grail he suggested that in the nearer term such markers might be used as a trigger to pre emptively begin erectile rehabilitation or to take measures that might lessen the potential damage this kind of work is important not just for prostate cancer but all cancers while there has been greater success in treating cancer survivors may live many years with side effects after treatment if rosenstein s hopes are fulfilled it may one day be possible to prevent some of the damage before it s done and still effectively treat the cancer brian alexander www brianralexander com is co author with larry young ph d of the chemistry between us love sex and the science of attraction www thechemistrybetweenus com now on sale related,1
by kathleen doheny healthday reporter tuesday sept healthday news a new device meant to help surgeons determine in the operating room if they have removed all cancerous breast cancer tissue may help reduce repeat surgeries after lumpectomy without compromising cosmetic effects according to a new study the device called marginprobe emits an electric field and senses a return signal from the tissue examined cancerous tissue provides a different electromagnetic signature than normal tissue the researchers explained this can potentially decrease having to go back to the operating room and with no real effect on your cosmetic outcome said study leader dr susan boolbol chief of breast surgery at beth israel medical center in new york city the study of nearly patients undergoing breast conserving surgery found little difference in the volume of tissue removed when the device was used compared to traditional detection methods the reality is most of the time we leave the operating room and we don t know if we have a clear margin with all cancer removed or not boolbol said doctors wait for the pathology report to find that out which can take a week or two with the new device the wait time is about five minutes everything still goes through pathology boolbol said but the marginprobe is another tool that might help reduce the odds of needing a subsequent surgery she said boolbol is scheduled to present the findings thursday at the american society of clinical oncology s breast cancer symposium in san francisco in june the radiation free device won the blessing of a u s food and drug administration advisory panel the fda usually follows the advisory panel s recommendations so device approval is anticipated for the study boolbol and her colleagues randomly assigned breast cancer patients to receive the marginprobe after lumpectomy or not receive it of those had early cancer known as ductal carcinoma in situ the others had invasive cancers where the device detected cancer cells near the edge or surface of the sample examined surgeons removed additional tissue in the same procedure typically about percent of lumpectomy patients need another surgery because of the difficulty distinguishing between healthy and cancerous cells in tissue around the tumor we looked at whether we could lower the repeat surgery rate by using this device boolbol said the patients were followed for two months to see if they needed a repeat surgery for those with ductal carcinoma in situ percent of the probe group needed a repeat surgery compared to percent of the control group among women with invasive breast cancer percent in the device group and percent in the comparison group required more surgery looking at the volume of tissue excised the researchers said not much more tissue was removed when the device was used compared to tissue removed in the initial and subsequent surgeries among the control group patients boolbol said dr laura kruper director of the cooper finkel women s health center and co director of the breast cancer program at city of hope comprehensive cancer center in duarte calif said the device looks promising however she thinks more research is needed i would like to see it used in a larger population she said if the results are repeated in larger studies it could be a welcome addition to doctors techniques she said the expected cost of the marginprobe in the united states if approved is not yet known said michael graffeo a spokesman for its maker dune medical devices in europe where the device is available each probe one per patient sells for about euros or he said this is much less than the cost of re operation he noted the device is also being studied for use with prostate cancer the company said data and conclusions presented at meetings should be considered preliminary until published in a peer reviewed medical journal more information to learn more about breast cancer surgery visit the american cancer society,1
new york reuters health acupuncture may help relieve chronic back joint and shoulder pain according to a new review of the evidence but some of its benefit is likely due to the placebo effect researchers concluded a patient lies on a bed as he undergoes acupuncture treatment at beijing s capital medical university traditional chinese medicine hospital april reuters david gray in an analysis of studies they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn t but patients treated with fake or sham acupuncture using retracting needles that don t stick in the skin for example estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure a doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options such as medications and physical or talk therapy said lead author andrew vickers from memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york this provides evidence that they would be justified in considering acupuncture he told reuters health acupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia some think it has potential as an add on or alternative to standard treatment while others argue any acupuncture related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them that either means many of the three million americans that get acupuncture every year are wasting their time or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits vickers said to try to help sort out which is the case he and his colleagues analyzed studies they deemed to be high quality comparisons of acupuncture fake acupuncture and no treatment those trials included close to patients in the united states and europe with back and neck pain shoulder pain chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis the researchers found that on average people treated with acupuncture reported a modest improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment and a larger effect compared to untreated patients they estimated in their archives of internal medicine report that about percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture compared to almost percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and percent with no acupuncture like therapy a typical acupuncture session runs for about and is often not covered by health insurance usually not the first step i have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture said jongbae park head of asian medicine acupuncture research at the university of north carolina at chapel hill school of medicine it s usually not their first approach to address the condition he said rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain park who was not involved in the new study said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain rather than treating the pain itself as medications would i am a biased clinician park told reuters health but he added i would sincerely say more than percent of my patients will see improvement vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed in those cases he said acupuncture is very safe and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic source bit ly mbblbb archives of internal medicine online september,1
photo for two decades patricia digiusto struggled with severe asthma powerful medications and frequent use of her inhaler could not prevent repeated trips to the emergency room on one particularly bad night ms digiusto watched from her hospital bed as doctors and nurses prepared to insert plastic tubing down her windpipe to help her breathe gasping for air she was certain she would not survive i ll never forget that feeling said ms digiusto a speech pathologist in braintree mass the feeling that i m never going to see my kids or husband again and that asthma is finally going to get me two years ago ms digiusto s doctor told her about a new procedure called bronchial thermoplasty the first non drug therapy approved by the food and drug administration for patients with severe asthma during the procedure a doctor guides a bronchoscope into a patient s airways there it heats the lungs to degrees fahrenheit cooler than a cup of coffee but warm enough to shrink the smooth muscle in the airways which swells during an asthma attack and restricts breathing after the procedure the airways no longer are so prone to constricting studies show asthma patients suffer fewer attacks and need fewer hospital visits ms digiusto had the procedure in march since then she has ended most of her medications and has not had a single asthma attack i m a language therapist she said but i can t even think of the word to describe how much better this has made my life across the country about million people suffer from asthma every year about die because of it avoiding allergens and using inhaled medications are enough to keep asthma under control in most patients but for the minority with severe persistent asthma medication and lifestyle changes are not enough frequent hospital trips are almost inevitable and powerful steroids like prednisone which can cause thinning bones cataracts depression and other debilitating side effects become a necessity nationwide asthma treatment costs exceed billion a year and over half of that is spent on severe asthmatics who make up only percent of the asthma population doctors say bronchial thermoplasty has given them a new weapon in the battle against severe asthma and many patients call it life changing but the procedure is expensive costing around and insurers have been reluctant to cover it as a result many people who need it doctors say are forced to go without it for those of us in the field who work with severe asthmatics and see how limited they are it s frustrating because we have this new therapy we ve seen it work and the data says it works said dr roy st john a pulmonary disease specialist at columbus pulmonary and critical care in ohio but the big insurers have all denied it although bronchial thermoplasty was approved by the f d a only two years ago clinical studies on it began in since then about patients across the country have had the procedure it takes place in three steps each separated by about three weeks each time a different section of the lungs is treated some patients report temporary coughing mucus and other respiratory symptoms brought on by irritation of airways but several five year studies showed no long term safety issues and researchers at washington university school of medicine found that compared with a control group bronchial thermoplasty patients saw their asthma attacks drop by a third their emergency room visits fall by percent and the number of days they lost from work and school drop by percent this isn t a cure but it is definitely a breakthrough said dr pratik s patel director of interventional pulmonary medicine at newark beth israel medical center in new jersey it s not going to get rid of asthma but it is going to reduce symptoms and hospitalizations and make patients more functional in their daily life for now the procedure is only for severe asthmatics who unlike a vast majority of asthma patients cannot keep flare ups at bay with standard medications said dr kyle hogarth an assistant professor of medicine at the university of chicago who was involved in clinical studies of the treatment there are millions and millions of asthmatics he said there will not be millions of thermoplasty patients still even patients with severe asthma often are denied insurance coverage for the procedure susan pisano a spokeswoman for america s health insurance plans the industry trade group said insurers are awaiting the results of an additional five year clinical trial required by the f d a when it approved bronchial thermoplasty that trial will not be completed until at least until then ms pisano said many insurers are denying coverage on the grounds the procedure is experimental the issue here for health plans is the long term safety and efficacy have yet to be established she said but three five year studies have already been completed many asthma specialists believe that insurers are taking a shortsighted approach the one time cost of they say is dwarfed by the tens of thousands of dollars in hospital bills and medication costs that a severe asthmatic can easily accumulate in a single year one such patient alberto gaulion a retired importer in miami estimated that for much of the last decade his insurer blue cross blue shield spent about a year on his medical care every two or three weeks i had to go to the hospital he said and i was taking everything that was on the market i was on a cocktail of drugs blue cross would not cover the procedure for him so mr gaulion paid out of pocket when he had it in since then he has had no hospital visits and no asthma attacks and takes only one medication instead of five now i can breathe he said and i m saving my insurance company a fortune dr charlene mcevoy a director of an asthma center run by health partners the largest health plan in minnesota believed in thermoplasty enough to push the insurer to start covering it dr mcevoy argued that it made economic sense and earlier this year health partners agreed when plans look at the cost savings i think they re going to cover it said dr mcevoy an assistant professor of medicine at the university of minnesota you have to show that there s a return on investment,1

catch tumors earlier to screen or not to screen here s why experts still can t agree mike albans ny daily news archive via getty images psa blood testing at long island college hospital in brooklyn n y if you re wondering why experts still can t agree on prostate cancer screening you re not alone just two months ago a major u s government panel said that basically no one should get screened for prostate cancer claiming the simple blood test for prostate specific antigen or psa does more harm than good now a new study looks at government data and finds that without psa testing the u s would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal almost all men with clinically apparent metastases at initial diagnosis will die from prostate cancer urologist and study author edward messing told reporters as he explained the importance of his study the new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community between public health experts who have largely turned away from psa screening and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely more men should forgo psa testing u s panel advises no one denies that psa tests can help to catch prostate cancer early but two issues are still unresolved one is how well screening can actually work to prevent cancer deaths the other is what kind of negative effects screening brings along with its benefits on the first issue there is still some uncertainty in the u s a large randomized trial found no mortality benefit of screening but an even larger randomized clinical trial in europe has found a benefit in its latest results published this spring the european study team said that men who undergo routine testing have significantly lower risk of prostate cancer death after years still the real crux of the debate on psa testing is the second issue the possible negative effects of screening no diagnostic test is accurate and if a psa test comes back positive for prostate cancer the patient will usually be referred for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis that test can have side effects then if the patient does have cancer the available treatments for it surgery radiation as well as other options also have side effects chief among them impotence incontinence and urinary incontinence the same european trial that found lower cancer mortality with psa testing also found that to save just one life through screening an extra men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated many health experts think that s too much risky treatment to justify the results so when the government advisory panel the u s preventive services task force recommends against routine psa testing it s making a judgment call it s saying that for most men the albeit small risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it given the even smaller chance that psa testing could save your life but that decision does remain a judgment call it depends on how much you value certain quality of life measures versus how much you value having any life at all more surgery for early prostate cancer doesn t save lives as for the new paper this week which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren t for psa testing that study is published in the journal cancer and its numbers deserve a little explanation to calculate the total number of metastatic cases we d get without screening the study takes today s population of the united states and applies the rates broken down by age and race of advanced stage prostate cancer that were observed before psa testing was introduced that is the rates way back in in other words it tells us what the current u s population would look like if today we faced the same risks that americans faced in the s it finds we d have roughly u s men diagnosed with advanced stage prostate cancer each year compared to just today but is going back in time years really the same thing that we d get if we abolished psa testing today who knows the rate of new diagnoses of all cancer types combined has been falling consistently in recent years however prostate cancer is one of the few cancers that s not strongly linked to smoking and falling cigarette consumption over the past years is a major reason for falling cancer rates it is however linked to obesity which has been on the rise since the s one further fact to keep in mind is that psa testing works to cut the number of newly diagnosed advanced stage cancers but it does so by increasing the number of cancers that are caught early and as the debate over psa testing shows us early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives preventing progression to advanced stage cancer down the line but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process that s what experts can t agree about many doctors do have very strong opinions though as a patient if you re deciding whether to get a psa test or whether not to get a psa test remember you do have a right to your own opinion too there s no easy answer more prostate cancer screening what you need to know,1
take two slices of cherry pie and call me in the morning ok that s not quite the advice doctors are wont to give but it might make at least a sliver of sense cherry pie contains the same sort of anti inflammatory compounds as aspirin and other non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs at least the cherries do they re tart or sour cherries which as far as is known contain more of these anti inflammatory compounds than any other food says dr kerry kuehl assistant director of the human performance laboratory at oregon health and science university in portland kuehl is a coauthor of a new study suggesting that tart cherries could someday provide an alternative treatment for patients with inflammatory osteoarthritis who can t tolerate the standard drug therapy advertisement participants in the study presented at the american college of sports medicine conference in san francisco in may were women to years old who had all been diagnosed with inflammatory osteoarthritis and had experienced joint swelling at least once in the last year twice a day half of the women drank fluid ounces of tart cherry juice the other half drank that much fake cherry juice with the same calorie content flavor and consistency after three weeks the women who got the real stuff had significantly less inflammation as measured by c reactive protein in their blood than those who had been drinking the counterfeit the anti inflammatory powers of tart cherries can make them a smart choice for healthy people too in a number of studies athletes who drank tart cherry juice before running a race or doing intensive strength exercises felt less pain afterward and bounced back faster than those who didn t but tart cherries aren t just loaded with wham bam anti inflammatories they re chockablock with antioxidants and a study in the european journal of nutrition suggests that drinking tart cherry juice during the day may pay off in better snoozing at night thanks to high levels of the sleep regulating antioxidant melatonin advertisement these studies have been done with people but other promising research has only been done with lab animals so far in one study in the journal of medicinal food tart cherries helped fat rats not our favorite role models perhaps but the obese beasties risk of type diabetes and heart disease were reduced significantly and parallel studies are now in the works with members of our own species says lead author e mitchell seymour there are some interesting and potentially exciting results on the horizon stay tuned so what s not to like about tart cherries not much except for maybe the tart part let s just say the cherry topping off your hot fudge sundae is not a tart cherry the alluring cherries in the produce aisle are not tart cherries and those cherries that a happy life is supposedly just a bowl of they re not tart cherries either tart cherries are extremely bitter raw kuehl admits unpalatable but hey there is a solution don t eat tart cherries raw eat them dried or frozen in smoothies or drink them in juice even unsweetened something about juicing makes them taste better kuehl says some people really like it and of course you can always bake a pie,1
after her mother unexpectedly died from a tear in the wall of her heart at age patricia walters talked to her doctor leslie cho about how to better monitor her own heart health pregnant at the time with her own daughter ms walters now says she was a nervous wreck worrying that she too might face serious cardiac risk as part of an overall health evaluation after the pregnancy dr cho director of the women s cardiovascular center at the cleveland clinic recommended a simple blood test called hs crp for high sensitivity c reactive protein which is a marker for inflammation in the body easily done at the same time as a cholesterol screening and covered by most insurance the test is increasingly being used as a routine screening tool for patients with one or two risk factors to help assess their heart attack and stroke risk greater accuracy the hs crp test is a newer more sensitive version of a standard crp check and experts say it can more accurately detect lower concentrations of the protein making it more useful in predicting a healthy person s risk for cardiovascular disease it measures crp in milligrams per liter of blood less than mg l is considered low risk to mg l is average risk and greater than mg l is considered high risk for cardiovascular disease the american heart association and the american college of cardiology both have endorsed the use of hs crp for intermediate risk individuals and one major study suggests that even people with minimal risk factors in their late s and early s should have the test while inflammation is the body s natural response to a variety of physical states including fever injury and infection research shows it also plays a role in a range of chronic illnesses including cardiovascular disease inflammation of the arteries has been linked to heart attack sudden death and stroke dr cho notes those who smoke have high blood pressure and are overweight and sedentary tend to have high levels of crp and those who are thin and fit have lower levels but genetic factors can also contribute to elevated crp in people without traditional risk factors research shows that elevated levels of crp are at least as predictive of cardiac risk as cholesterol levels a study of healthy physicians published in the new england journal of medicine was the first to show that relative risk of first heart attack or stroke was directly related to elevated crp levels and the harvard women s health study which looked at different markers of inflammation in healthy postmenopausal women found that after three years crp was the strongest predictor of risk not so low risk while some experts don t think the hs crp test adds much to current cardiovascular risk prediction strategies others say a large study known as the jupiter trial supports broad use of the test to find people who may assume their low cholesterol levels protect them from heart trouble and determine whether they might be candidates for treatment with statin drugs the study showed that in patients with low levels of ldl the bad cholesterol but high hs crp levels the statin crestor reduced the risk of heart related death heart attacks and other serious cardiac problems by compared with those given placebos paul ridker a harvard university researcher who led the jupiter study says we know that those with elevated hs crp are at high risk even if cholesterol levels are low and that statin therapy can reduce the risk of heart attack and stroke in this group while the study showed inflammation contributes as much to cardiovascular risk as does high blood pressure or high cholesterol dr ridker says the core research question now is whether or not reducing inflammation per se will reduce that risk his team has now launched two major clinical trials one funded by the federal government and one by industry to address that question dr ridker is co inventor on patents held by brigham and women s hospital related to the use of inflammatory biomarkers including hs crp in evaluating risk for cardiovascular disease something to talk about dr cho at the cleveland clinic says the test can help identify those patients at intermediate risk and open the discussion about prevention and treatment if you are and chubby with high blood pressure and borderline high cholesterol but your crp is normal i m not sure i would throw the whole kitchen sink at you says dr cho but if your crp was elevated i would want to talk to you about the jupiter results and discuss starting a statin she also counsels patients with elevated levels about lifestyle changes including weight loss nutrition and exercise ms walters didn t have high levels when she was first tested but they began to rise in later screenings she now takes a statin and has her blood monitored regularly she also joined weight watchers to drop a few pounds and runs with friends for exercise a former teacher who is now a stay at home mom ms walters says i have a little girl and i plan to be here for everything ms landro is an assistant managing editor for the wall street journal and writes the paper s informed patient column she can be reached at corrections amplifications patricia walters had an hs crp test following her pregnancy an earlier version of this article incorrectly implied that she had the test while pregnant,1
bathing suit season is here and with it anxiety over cellulite a new laser device that burrows under the skin is getting praise from some doctors who say it gives more dramatic and longer lasting results than previous treatments but others caution that more research is needed cellulite is a dimpled uneven appearance of skin caused by fat underneath it affects some of women and about of men until recently the main treatments to battle cellulite have been external treatments such as creams and radio frequency and massage devices the creams are largely ineffective and the devices have a modest effect that typically lasts about six months doctors say aches claims looks at a new laser that burrows under the skin to treat cellulite cellulaze cuts fibers under the skin believed to be part of a major cause of the ugly dimpling phenonenom that affects of women leslie yazel has details on lunch break photo cynosure a therapy called cellulaze which uses a laser machine sold by cynosure inc in westford mass hit the u s market in february some doctors say the results are impressive the results are nothing short of remarkable says los angeles plastic surgeon grant stevens a clinical professor of surgery at the university of southern california s keck school of medicine in los angeles dr stevens who isn t affiliated with cynosure said he and another doctor in his practice together have treated about patients with cellulaze the cellulaze laser machine cynosure based on the published scientific data cellulaze is promising says mathew m avram director of the dermatology laser cosmetic center at massachusetts general hospital in boston but we need more clinical experience before we can make any definitive statements as to the efficacy of the device cellulaze is different from earlier treatments in that it tackles the root causes of cellulite including thinning skin and connective fibers called septae that are believed to create tension by pulling down the skin contributing to an uneven appearance says gordon h sasaki a clinical professor of plastic surgery at loma linda university medical university center in loma linda calif dr sasaki is a paid consultant to cynosure how cellulaze works tiny incisions are made so a cannula or tube can be inserted into the skin local anesthetic is inserted through the cannula laser light through the cannula cuts septae which scientists say help cause cellulite dimples the underside of the skin is heated and some small amounts of fat are melted bruises and tiny scars result but fade with time compression garments recommended to prevent fluid buildup cellulaze is done by plastic surgeons in their offices under local anesthetic it typically costs to for a bilateral area such as the thighs and another or more for each additional area one or more tiny incisions are made so a narrow tube called a cannula can be inserted into the skin laser light delivered through the cannula cuts the septae and melts small amounts of fat dr sasaki says it heats the underside of the skin which stimulates collagen production and makes skin thicker and more elastic he adds cellulaze leaves tiny scars about two millimeters long which fade with time surgeons say typically compression garments are recommended for at least two or three weeks to prevent fluid buildup and there will be bruises so patients typically need to wait three to six weeks before venturing out in a bathing suit surgeons say patients typically wait three to six weeks before going out in a bathing suit associated press the procedure can cause a buildup of fluid in the area that has been treated which can last for months and needs to be drained regularly by a doctor in a written statement cynosure says a few patients in early trials had the buildups called seromas adding that they need to be drained to prevent infections and other complications the company says it has since lowered the recommended laser dosage and it isn t aware of any seromas since the device hit the u s market according to a company funded study of women published last year in aesthetic surgery journal cellulaze resulted in skin that was thicker after a year cellulite reduction was good to excellent as graded by physicians dr sasaki in data obtained as part of a company financed trial that has yet to be published says of patients he treated are still enjoying substantial improvement two years after the surgery lawrence bass director of the minimally invasive plastic surgery program at new york university langone medical center in new york says the procedure appears to reduce the depth of cellulite dimples a person with less pronounced dimples is most likely to get a home run out of the procedure says dr bass who has attended scientific presentations of the data but hasn t performed the procedure but if you have really deep ones he adds it might not be enough to make the lifestyle change you want to make such as wearing shorts in the summertime the cannula cynosure if a deep dimple is still visible fat can be injected with a syringe later to even it out dr sasaki says another new laser treatment both for cellulite and body contouring is i lipo i lipo from chromogenex technologies ltd south wales england the laser which hit the u s market in december is noninvasive and involves pads placed externally on the skin i lipo provokes a chemical reaction that breaks down fat into its components says company clinical manager donna freeman after the treatment a cardiovascular workout of to minutes is recommended to burn off the components the ultra model of the device comes with a vacuum massage device aimed at smoothing cellulite but the effects on cellulite haven t yet been tested in a clinical trial the company says a patient study unpublished found eight minute sessions with the device reduced midsection size by inches measured by a tape measure compared with only a third of an inch for a sham therapy which looked the same to patients dr bass says he is skeptical because measuring tape data has a large margin of error chromogenex says the measurements used scientifically accepted standards

by amanda gardner healthday reporter monday july healthday news men may one day have a birth control option other than the condom or vasectomy if early research on a new contraceptive gel pans out preliminary findings suggest that when applied to the skin the gel dramatically lowers sperm counts thus also lowering though not eliminating the risk for pregnancy this is the first time that a combination of testosterone and a synthetic progestin called nestorone has been tested as a gel that could be applied topically previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch said study senior author dr christina wang a professor of medicine at los angeles biomedical research institute the combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available although men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control dr joseph alukal an assistant professor of urology at nyu langone medical center in new york city thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved i think men would use it more than is realized said alukal who was not involved in the new research plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy almost as much as women unfortunately condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men the results of the study funded by the u s national institutes of child health and human development were presented at the recent endocrine society annual meeting held in houston according to wang the gel was applied in two spots the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen the gels were applied every day for six months the study conducted in conjunction with the university of washington involved men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a placebo gel with no progestin up to percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than million sperm per milliliter versus just percent of those receiving only testosterone normal sperm concentration is more than million sperm per milliliter according to the mayo clinic s website up to percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all versus only percent of men taking testosterone alone the testosterone progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes wang explained one important and unanswered question is what the long term side effects of this regimen might be the answer said wang is we just don t know that s apart from mild to moderate acne or an increase in acne which was seen in about percent of participants a new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem wang speculated another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts alukal said in addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone which is more potent than testosterone because the new study was presented at a medical meeting the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer reviewed journal more information there s more on contraception at the american college of obstetricians and gynecologists,1
en español tuesday june healthday news electroencephalogram eeg a test that shows the electrical activity of the brain might be used to spot autism in children a new study suggests the study conducted by researchers at harvard university medical school looked at the synchronization of brain activity across different brain regions as measured by eeg these scientists used sensors to record electrical brain activity across many different regions on the scalp explained geraldine dawson chief science officer at the advocacy group autism speaks they then looked at the extent to which brain activity from one region was synchronized with brain activity from another region a phenomenon known as eeg coherence said dawson who was not involved in the research synchronization between different brain regions indicates that those regions are functioning in a coordinated rather than independent fashion in other words they are functionally connected and communicating with each other she said in the new study dr frank duffy and dr heidelise als compared eeg measurements of nearly children with and without autism they found that the two groups had widespread differences in terms of brain connectivity eeg revealed that the children with autism had a reduced short range connectivity indicating poor function of local brain networks this was especially true in the left hemisphere regions of the brain responsible for language the children with autism also had increased connectivity between brain regions that were farther apart which might be a mechanism developed to compensate for reduced short range connectivity the researchers said the research was conducted at boston children s hospital and was published online june in the journal bmc medicine the use of eeg based testing may help diagnose autism in children and may improve early detection in infants leading to more effective treatments and coping strategies the researchers said what was unique about this study is the very large number of children studied dawson noted consistent with many previous studies using eeg and functional mri with both children and adults with autism these investigators found that overall children with autism show reduced coordination coherence across brain regions she said the findings are important because they help us understand why individuals with autism have difficulty with complex behaviors such as social interaction and language as children s brains develop the different brain regions become increasingly connected allowing for the acquisition of complex behaviors that require coordination across different brain regions language for example requires coordination across the auditory visual and motor brain regions as well as the participation of the prefrontal cortex she said this reduced functional connectivity in the brain helps us understand impairments associated with autism she added the hope is that early behavioral intervention can help mitigate these functional impairments helping to form the connections that natural develop in typical children another expert agreed although autism is still principally a clinical diagnosis this study may allow for a new approach to classifying children with autism and may even assist in the early identification of affected children at a younger age said dr andrew adesman chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the steven alexandra cohen children s medical center of new york in new hyde park ny the number of children diagnosed with autism in the united states has recently increased to one in more information the u s national institute of neurological disorders and stroke has more about autism,1
if you re one of the estimated million americans with osteoarthritis you re probably all too familiar with the feeling of aching swollen or stiff knees nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs such as ibuprofen may relieve those painful symptoms in most patients but for others doctors may prescribe a more invasive treatment that involves injecting hyaluronic acid in to the knee called viscosupplementation now a new report questions the efficacy of this treatment for osteoarthritis in the knee hyaluronic acid is a lubricating fluid that is naturally found in the knee but degenerates over time in people with osteoarthritis the effect of the injection used in viscosupplementation is to stimulate cells in the knee to increase production of hyaluronic acid in a meta analysis of reports that included data on more than patients with osteoarthritis in the knee researchers at the institute of social and preventive medicine at the university of bern in switzerland concluded that the treatment has minimal benefits and potential for harm they write that because of increased risks for serious adverse events and local adverse events the administration of these preparations should be discouraged dr john richmond disagrees he is the chairman of the orthopedics department at new england baptist hospital and the previous chair of the american academy of orthopaedic surgeons aaos working group on treatment of osteoarthritis in knees we have an epidemic of osteoarthritis of the knee and we have limited treatment options says dr richmond who was not affiliated with the analysis but who reviewed the same data it was based on this needs to remain one of those limited treatment options and should be used appropriately by the physician giving it the most common side effects patients undergoing viscosupplementation may endure are flare ups where the knee becomes hot and swollen within hours after the injection and effusions where excessive joint fluid collects inside the knee the researchers in switzerland reviewed the existing studies and concluded that viscosupplementation was associated with an increase in these and other adverse events dr richmond who has independently reviewed the same research when the aaos was drafting their recommendations to treat osteoarthritis of the knee argues that despite infrequent instances of those side effects viscosupplementation remains a solid treatment choice for some patients this is most effective in relatively younger patients to to year olds and in people with mild to moderate forms of the disease says richmond this is not a first line treatment but it s a reasonable treatment in those people who have been appropriately screened the authors of the study discourage patients from getting this treatment however richmond says patients considering viscosupplementation should discuss this as a treatment option with their doctor,0

en español by amanda gardner healthday reporter tuesday june healthday news a simple blood test may help gauge prognosis and tailor treatments for women who have been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer the test described in the june online edition of the lancet oncology measures how many tumor cells are circulating in the blood in the new study if even one cell was detected in the bloodstream a woman had a greater chance of her cancer recurring and of dying this may help with prognosis and staging of the cancer and in the future with targets for breast cancer treatments said study lead author dr anthony lucci a professor of surgery at the university of texas md anderson cancer center in houston commenting on the findings dr stephanie bernik chief of surgical oncology at lenox hill hospital in new york city said we are moving into a state where we re looking at a person s individual tumor and this is another way to do that potentially leading to treatment whether or not cancer has spread to the lymph nodes is currently the best way to predict survival in women with breast cancer even so a substantial number of patients whose cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes will have a recurrence while some of those who do have lymph node involvement won t relapse blood tests similar to the one investigated in this study have been found to be useful to gauge how well patients who already have metastatic cancer will do for this study researchers counted circulating tumor cells in breast cancer patients who were about to undergo surgery but who hadn t yet received chemotherapy circulating tumor cells were detectable in about one quarter of the participants the investigators found fifteen percent of these individuals had a relapse and percent died during a five year follow up compared with percent and percent respectively of patients who did not have circulating tumor cells the more tumor cells a woman had in her bloodstream the higher the likelihood of relapsing or dying according to the report although the test may not be far off in terms of clinical practice we need additional studies lucci said one area for study is how well these circulating cells predict recurrence and death in patients who have already had chemotherapy currently the american society of clinical oncology does not recommend that clinicians measure circulating tumor cells in patients and in an accompanying comment article justin stebbing a professor in the department of surgery and cancer at imperial college in london said that despite increasing evidence supporting the use of circulating tumor cells as biomarkers how this information can be integrated into present practice is uncertain according to bernik though it makes sense that women who have circulating tumor cells would potentially be at higher risk of distant disease at some later date the problem is that just having circulating tumor cells may not be enough information to foretell the future she noted the cells also need to have a propensity to grow elsewhere she said not every cancer cell becomes a metastatic cancer cell hopefully gaining the ability to tell which cells are more likely to spread potentially could guide therapy bernik added according to lucci circulating tumor cells are also showing promise in predicting melanoma prognosis so the method may be effective in several different tumor systems more information the u s national cancer institute has more on breast cancer,1
many of us theorize that the two are tied inflammation causes seizures and seizures cause inflammation said orrin devinsky director of the comprehensive epilepsy center at the new york university langone medical center and william s doctor over time both of them may feed off each other about million people worldwide including more than million people in the united states are struggling with epilepsy in some form half of all patients are children epilepsy can result from brain injury but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic refractory epilepsy its intractable form and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning memory and behavior an epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function motor function and behavior it s not known what sets off a seizure but lately scientists like dr devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation the immune system s response to injuries or foreign organisms plays a pivotal role scientists have known since the s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called rasmussen s encephalitis which starts seizures and usually affects children inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy the surgical removal of one of the brain s hemispheres some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy infantile spasms because children with the disease respond to acth a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti inflammatory effects eleonora aronica a neuropathologist at the university of amsterdam has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies annamaria vezzani a neuroscientist at the mario negri institute for pharmacological research in milan has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures the amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures she also has found this is a novel finding dr vezzani said in an interview it was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy photo normal brain function is regulated by the glial cells which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured but this response also can contribute to seizures some experts believe either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become distracted by an injury as dr devinsky noted seizures in turn may produce further inflammation perpetuating the cycle advertisement continue reading the main story now dr vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called vx that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered in one study high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two thirds in mice with treatment resistant epilepsy sixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking vx for six weeks but they did

is now the subject of a phase trial involving patients anti inflammatory therapies could at least supplement and perhaps replace anticonvulsants said dr jacqueline french a neurologist at the n y u comprehensive epilepsy center who is leading the new trial replacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself although they give many epileptics a better quality of life they do not affect the course of the disease only its symptoms researchers hope that anti inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy s underlying causes giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy as opposed to treating the seizure would be absolutely novel dr french said but there are dangers to this approach steroids potent anti inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments can have harmful long term side effects and it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti inflammatory treatment like any new field there s a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved said dr tallie z baram an epilepsy expert at the university of california irvine the challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations the boundaries the real mechanisms still whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy elisa moller says that anti inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son at william s worst point a night in july he had a seizure every time he fell asleep suffering grand mals between midnight and a m dr devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone a steroid and in desperation ms moller decided to administer a mega dose i was taking his life into my hands i know she said but the way i looked at it he was going to die anyway since that night william has not had another seizure he continues with the steroids and also follows the ketogenic diet a high fat low carbohydrate regimen that has proved beneficial for many with intractable epilepsy advertisement

john foxx getty images an aspirin a day could keep skin cancer away according to a new report in the journal cancer researchers in denmark and the u s found that people taking common painkillers like aspirin and ibuprofen were less likely to develop skin cancer including squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma especially when they took the drugs for at least seven years or used them at least twice a week it s not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a lower risk of colon lung and prostate cancers compared with non users in the current trial researchers looked at all cancer cases in the danish cancer registry from to and compared this data against that of a prescription drug database that recorded patients histories of using aspirin nsaids or cox inhibitors drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain more will an aspirin prolong your life it depends overall cases of skin cancer were included in the study each case was compared to matched controls who did not develop the disease over the study period people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin nsaids or cox inhibitors had a lower risk of melanoma and a lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions the researchers found the longer people took the drugs and the higher the dose the greater the anticancer benefit longer higher intensity use for example led to a lower risk of melanoma a lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a lower risk of basal cell carcinoma the most common form of skin cancer in the u s the relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer such as use of other medications however the researchers didn t have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to uv radiation the drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors ability to expand and develop blood supplies given the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of nsaids a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications the authors led by sigrun alba johannesdottir from aarhus university hospital in denmark wrote more aspirin a wonder drug studies show it may prevent cancer in the u s skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed affecting more than million people each year but taking aspirin and aspirin like drugs isn t without consequences they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers one cox inhibitor vioxx was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease but given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers we hope that the potential cancer protective effect of nsaids will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention johannesdottir said in a statement also this potential cancer protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of nsaid use alice park is a writer at time find her on twitter at aliceparkny you can also continue the discussion on time s facebook page and on twitter at time,1
monday may healthday news the new blood thinner xarelto appears to lower the chances of potentially fatal blood clots in high risk heart patients a u s food and drug administration review has found the review came in briefing documents that were filed monday in advance of an fda advisory panel meeting wednesday at which the panel is to vote on whether to recommend approval of xarelto for treating people with acute coronary syndrome a group of conditions brought on by sudden reduced blood flow to the heart the fda is not required to follow the advice of its expert panels but the agency typically does a final decision is expected by the end of june according to the documents xarelto rivaroxaban is one of a new class of blood thinners that have been developed to overcome some of the problems that exist with the standard treatment warfarin coumadin which requires constant dose monitoring warfarin s effectiveness also can be altered by certain foods and other medications xarelto already is approved for use by those with atrial fibrillation irregular heartbeat and by people who are having hip or knee replacement surgery in the fda briefing documents an agency reviewer recommended approving the drug for treatment of acute coronary syndrome mostly because trial data showed there was a reduction in cardiovascular death even though there was also an increased risk of potentially fatal bleeding however what is not reflected in the sponsor s analysis are minor bleeding events fda reviewer dr karen hicks wrote in the briefing documents while it is true that these bleeding events typically do not lead to death or irreversible harm these events may represent the biggest problem for both patients and health care providers if rivaroxaban is approved while reductions in cardiovascular death still trump these bleeding events if rivaroxaban is approved we should expect a number of bleeding events that will require medical attention hicks wrote carefully selecting patients for rivaroxaban therapy will be necessary to mitigate these bleeding risks in research presented at the american stroke association s international stroke conference in new orleans last february australian doctors followed more than people who took either xarelto or warfarin for a median of two years of those patients had bleeding in the brain people who took xarelto and suffered from the most common type of atrial fibrillation and didn t have heart valve damage were about one third less likely to experience bleeding in the brain than those who took warfarin the investigators found more information the u s national institute of neurological disorders and stroke has more about stroke,1
may acupuncture may allow people with the lung disease copd chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to breathe a bit easier copd is the umbrella term for chronic lung diseases including chronic bronchitis and emphysema it is often marked by a chronic cough and shortness of breath treatment typically involves the use of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators to open airways and make breathing easier in a new study of people with copd some got acupuncture along with their daily medication for three months others got a sham acupuncture treatment in which the needles did not enter their skin those who received acupuncture along with their daily medication for three months were able to walk longer without becoming breathless compared to those who got the sham acupuncture treatment the study appears online in the archives of internal medicine people who received real acupuncture also showed improvements in their quality of life and ability to exercise according to researchers from kyoto university and meiji university of integrative medicine in kyoto japan many people with copd have problems getting optimal nutrition because of their condition the study showed that acupuncture may improve stomach function making it easier for people with copd to eat a healthy diet and maintain a normal weight,1
a new method for performing a virtual colonoscopy that requires less unpleasant preparation was shown in a new study to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps and was a better experience for patients the second leading cause of cancer deaths in the u s after lung cancer colon cancer can be prevented if precancerous polyps known as adenomas are found and removed during a colonoscopy according to the centers for disease control and prevention if everyone or older were regularly screened as many as of deaths could be avoided but dr michael zalis a radiologist at massachusetts general hospital tells the health blog that many people may avoid this procedure because the preparation which requires patients to cleanse their colons with a laxative is so unpleasant in addition some patients fear the instrument used in the procedure or have concerns about the risks from anesthesia or of perforation of the bowel no one should be dying from colon cancer which is almost completely preventable with screening and if it were sufficiently easy more people would do it says zalis lead author of the study published monday in the annals of internal medicine in recent years the use of computed tomographic colonography known as ct or virtual colonoscopy has eliminated the need for the most invasive part of the procedure but though these virtual scans are performed externally patients still have to take the laxatives so the scanning machines can read the empty colon so the researchers developed a software program to electronically cleanse the bowel zalis says prior to a scan researchers asked patients to adhere to a low fiber diet for a few days and drink a special fluid to tag the colon s contents after performing the ct scan the software electronically identified polyps the researchers screened patients with the laxative free ct scan and followed up with traditional colonoscopy to find out how successfully the virtual method detected precancerous polyps of six millimeters or more the laxative free scan accurately identified of patients with polyps of mm or larger those at highest risk of becoming cancerous but was less accurate for smaller lesions the study says dr james aisenberg a gastroenterologist and clinical professor of medicine at mount sinai medical center in new york agrees that for some people the laxative requirement can be a barrier to colorectal screening however like virtual colonoscopy in general laxative free ctc will miss a subset of precancerous polyps and thus is unlikely to become the gold standard for colorectal cancer prevention says dr aisenberg who wasn t involved with the study however the laxative free method may become a useful alternative for persons who won t otherwise undergo screening and is much better than no screening at all dr zalis and some of his co investigators developed the software the american cancer society the national institutes of health and general electric co s health care unit which markets scanning devices and accessories supported the researchers dr zalis says the company had no influence on the study,1

news flash eggs are really good for you this message was brought to you by the american egg board that s right the folks who sell eggs paid for a study that comes to the shocking conclusion that eggs are an ideal breakfast food they could have just asked people if they liked eating eggs for breakfast instead they recruited volunteers who were overweight or obese and assigned them to a week of either egg breakfasts or ready to eat cereal breakfasts after a two week gap the groups were switched both types of breakfasts had the same number of calories but the egg breakfasts contained higher protein quality according to an abstract for the study posted online here the folks who carried out this egg industry funded research were from the pennington biomedical research center in baton rouge la this place conducts some serious research on diet and weight so to assess whether people who ate egg breakfasts were better off than their counterparts who ate cereal they took blood samples and measured the concentration of two key hunger hormones acylated ghrelin which stimulates hunger and pyy which is how the intestines let the brain know that you re full sure enough in the week when they ate eggs volunteers had lower acylated ghrelin and higher pyy compared with the week when they ate cereal advertisement the researchers also treated the volunteers to four buffet lunches they weren t just being nice researchers kept track of how much food everyone ate they found that volunteers ate smaller lunches after they ate egg breakfasts compared with when they ate cereal breakfasts the reason they were less hungry the study was presented saturday at the european congress on obesity in france by nikhil dhurandhar a biochemist who studies obesity at pennington according to his website dhurandhar s research usually focuses on viruses and other infectious agents that can cause obesity return to the booster shots blog,0
by jenifer goodwin healthday reporter tuesday may healthday news researchers have found new evidence showing that resveratrol a compound found in red wine may play a role in preventing cell aging the study in rodents found that when mice had a particular gene sirt knocked out or turned off resveratrol had no effect on them but tests of muscle tissue in mice with a normal sirt gene that were given resveratrol found that the substance boosted mitochondrial function mitochondria provide the energy that cells need to function a decrease in mitochondrial energy production has been linked to a variety of diseases including diabetes and alzheimer s disease as well as to the aging process itself said senior study author david sinclair a professor of genetics at harvard medical school in boston but don t go reaching for that chianti yet yes resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes but the amounts we gave to our mice would be like drinking glasses of red wine a day sinclair said instead the goal is to develop synthetic resveratrol compounds that activate sirt and could be taken as medication my colleagues are in the middle of developing better molecules that we hope will be medicines that will be used to treat diseases of aging not to extend lifespan though that may be a side effect sinclair said the study is in the may issue of cell metabolism while previous studies have also suggested that resveratrol may have anti aging properties the precise mechanism of resveratrol has been controversial several studies including work with yeast worms and flies have found that resveratrol acts on a class of seven genes known as sirtuins and in human cells sirt in particular but other researchers have argued that resveratrol may work by activating a separate energy pathway called ampk which is also related to mitochondrial energy production but does not involve sirtuin genes testing the effect of resveratrol on sirt in mice was difficult sinclair said mice that have their sirt gene deleted are born with developmental defects and are unsuitable for experiments he explained so sinclair and two graduate students nathan price and ana gomes worked for years to come up with a method for knocking out sirt in healthy adult mice our paper found you absolutely require the sirt gene for resveratrol to improve the metabolism of the mice sinclair said the paper also showed that the ampk pathway was activated in mice given high doses of resveratrol yet there was no benefit to mitochondrial function there was no effect on ampk in mice given a lower dose of resveratrol sinclair is co founder and a consultant for sirtris pharmaceuticals inc which is developing resveratrol like molecules for use as treatment for age related diseases in according to news reports the company which is owned by glaxosmithkline halted clinical trials of resveratrol but sinclair said the company continues to develop improved synthetic molecules george vlasuk ceo of sirtris said the new findings offer the first definitive evidence for a direct link between sirt and the metabolic benefits of resveratrol the work by first author price et al strongly supports the basic rationale being pursued at sirtris which focuses on the development of small molecule compounds that directly activate the enzymatic activity of sirt as a new therapeutic approach to many diseases of aging vlasuk wrote in an email to the journal philippe marambaud an investigator at the litwin zucker center for research in alzheimer s disease and memory disorders at the feinstein institute for medical research in manhasset n y said the new research adds to a body of evidence that resveratrol can potentially combat aging by boosting mitochondrial activity in this study by using an elegant adult inducible sirt knock out mouse model the authors now provide compelling evidence that sirt is required in vivo in the animal for the effect of resveratrol on ampk activation and on mitochondrial function marambaud said while studies involving animals can be useful they frequently fail to produce similar results in humans a mouse model is not a human being especially when you are genetically manipulating this animal model you want to be very careful marambaud said this field has been extremely controversial we should be very careful about claiming the importance of resveratrol for medical purposes we have to wait and see but this study is a big step forward more information the u s centers for disease control and prevention has more on healthy aging,1
if you had a history of suffering from migraines and could prevent the debilitating headaches by swallowing a few pills you d do it wouldn t you actually odds are you wouldn t neurologists say that only about one third of those who could benefit by migraine preventing medication actually use it preventive treatment involves taking a seizure drug and a beta blocker every day to reduce the frequency severity and duration of migraines neurologists estimate that about of people who suffer from migraines stand to benefit with such a regimen and studies suggest that as many as half of migraines can be prevented with drugs according to dr stephen d silberstein a neurologist at the jefferson headache center at thomas jefferson university in philadelphia silberstein was the lead author of new migraine treatment guidelines presented monday at the annual meeting of the american academy of neurology in new orleans it would seem that migraineurs would be eager to stop these headaches before they start in a summary of the guidelines written for patients and their families this is how migraines are described advertisement migraine is a condition that involves recurring headaches each headache may last from four hours to two days it can cause throbbing pain in the head other symptoms may include nausea upset stomach vomiting and extreme sensitivity to light or sound most people with migraine have attacks that happen repeatedly yuck people whose migraines are infrequent or mild may not be able to prevent them with drugs the guidelines say but for those who can the best seizure drugs are divalproex sodium depakote sodium valproate depakote depakene stavzor and topiramate topamax or topiragen beta blockers are usually taken to treat high blood pressure heart arrhythmias and other cardiovascular conditions though metoprolol lopressor or toprol propranolol inderal and timolol blocadren can also help with migraines the authors also noted that frovatriptan frova which is used to treat migraine symptoms can also help prevent menstrual migraines advertisement these medications are effective for migraine prevention and should be offered to patients with migraine to reduce migraine attack frequency and severity silberstein and colleagues wrote in the new guidelines which were based on a review of publications in addition an herbal remedy derived from a family of plants called petasites or butterbur was found to be effective according to the review the review identified a handful of drugs that are probably effective and should be considered for migraine prevention these include the antidepressants amitriptyline elavil endep or vanatrip and venlafaxine effexor the beta blockers atenolol senormin or tenormin and nadolol corgard and for menstrual migraines naratriptan amerge and zolmitriptan zomig people need to keep in mind that all drugs includingover the counter drugsand complementary treatments can have side effects or interact with other medications which should be monitored silberstein said in a statement five of the six co authors of the new guidelines including silberstein disclosed that they receive research funding speaking fees and other payments from drug companies the guidelines will be published in tuesday s edition of the journal neurology they were developed in conjunction with the american headache society you can read the new guidelines here or check out the patient friendly summary here return to the booster shots blog,1
no one wants to hear that he or she has alzheimer s disease but if the beta amyloid plaques that are the disorder s key physical hallmark could be detected before memory loss and cognitive troubles were evident to all would you want to know and since no treatment currently works to stem the inexorable progress ofalzheimer s who would pay for a costly test to detect it early and why those questions are no longer hypothetical last week the fda approved an agent called florbetapir f injection to be marketed as amyvid which will allow physicians using a positron emissions tomography pet scan to detect the presence and extent of amyloid plaques in patients concerned about declining mental function and on monday the american academy of neurology released a new study showing that an agent called florbetaben also allowed detection of amyloid plaques when used with a pet scan the florbetaben study is to be presented at the academy s emerging science program next week in new orleans both florbetapir f and florbetaben help diagnose alzheimer s by sticking to beta amyloid clumps and emitting radioactivity which can then be picked up by a pet scan until recently the diagnosis of alzheimer s disease could be made only after a patient s death when a pathologist could find physical evidence of amyloid plaques and neurofibrillary tangles a brain biopsy now can be used to detect alzheimer s plaques but is highly invasive and may miss parts of the brain where the plaques and tangles of alzheimer s are densest while diagnosis by proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy is under study for early detection accurate early detection by such noninvasive means is a ways away advertisement the fda says that amyvid is not a test to predict the development of ad associated dementia in those who have no problematic symptoms it s an early test for those who already have cognitive concerns and who wonder whether alzheimer s disease may be the cause among patients diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment about have amyloid plaques and will go on to develop dementia that is likely alzheimer s disease said dr michael w weiner of the department of veterans affairs center for imaging of neurodegenerative diseases weiner is the leading researcher on the largest and most comprehensive alzheimer s research initiative of its kind the alzheimer s disease neuroimaging initiative adni a nationwide consortium that is still enrolling subjects is a five year million project that will track participants to compare how mental and daily life skills and the brain s structure and function change in those aging normally those with mild cognitive impairment and those with dementia weiner conducted much of the research leading to amyvid s approval for now says weiner there is no consensus on which patients should get the costly new pet scans that use amyvid and large insurers such as medicare and medicaid have not made decisions about coverage for such tests and some patients may question whether they would want to know that the source of their mental troubles is alzheimer s disease said weiner but for many when you take a person to the doctor you usually want an answer whether it leads to a treatment or not this is a way of getting closer to an answer said weiner many patients experiencing cognitive lapses may also be reassured if the test fails to reveal amyloid plaques he added advertisement with growing understanding that the changes of alzheimer s disease may be decades in the making the value of early detection is gaining adherents said weiner the real game changer he says will be when one of the many experimental therapies under study for alzheimer s disease succeeds in blocking or reversing its progress once that happens physicians researchers and insurers will need to figure out who should get the test and at what cost and who will pay,1
dept of clinical radiology salisbury district hospital getty images an experimental treatment for prostate cancer tumors using high intensity focused ultrasound hifu shows promise as an effective treatment with fewer side effects than existing therapies the idea behind the new procedure is similar to lumpectomy in breast cancer patients in which doctors remove only the tumors instead of the entire breast using hifu doctors can focus on treating only the cancer cells on the prostate while causing minimal damage to the surrounding tissue unlike more common and invasive treatments such as radiotherapy and surgical removal of the prostate gland hifu may be able to avoid side effects like urine leakage and impotence more circumcision the surgery that may lower prostate cancer risk the new study designed as a proof of concept study involved just men doctors used mri and mapping biopsies to locate the cancerous tissues they then focused high energy sound waves on the affected area causing the cancer cells to heat up to around c which kills the cells none of the patients reported urinary incontinence a year after treatment and only in suffered from poor erections overall about of the men were cancer free after a full year following the trial the signal from this study is quite strong study author hashim ahmed a urologist at the university college london told bloomberg when you look at the current standard of care there s a in or in chance of having the perfect outcome in this study after months it s a in chance the men in the study were aged to with medium to high risk cancer and would likely have undergone surgery or radiotherapy down the line men who had already received chemotherapy hormone treatment or radiation therapy were excluded from the study the procedure was carried out under general anesthesia and most of the patients had hospital stays of less than hours after the treatment more cancer rates decline overall but obesity and tanning lead to upticks focal therapy of individual prostate cancer lesions regardless of whether they are multifocal or unifocal leads to a low rate of genitourinary side effects and an encouraging rate of early freedom from clinically significant prostate cancer the authors concluded in the study prostate cancer is the most common cancer among men the national cancer institute estimates new cases of prostate cancer this year in the u s and deaths ahmed told bloomberg that hifu may also be cheaper than other standard treatments noting that the cost of the mri and mapping was an estimated plus about for hifu in comparison removing the prostate costs about fewer side effects would also lower other health care costs he said more the screening dilemma the researchers are now recruiting more patients and seeking funding for larger studies while the initial results were promising they need to be replicated hifu also needs to be studied long term and compared with other therapies if the technology holds up it could also work for other cell based cancers like breast thyroid pancreas and liver ahmed said the study was published tuesday in the journal the lancet oncology,0

en español by serena gordon healthday reporter wednesday april healthday news regularly consumption of food and drink rich in substances called flavonoids such as berries apples tea and red wine can lower a man s risk of developing parkinson s disease by percent new research suggests for women however a reduction in risk was only seen when they ate at least several servings of berries a week according to the study men also had a risk reduction from frequently eating berries for total flavonoids the beneficial result was only in men but berries are protective in both men and women said the study s lead author dr xiang gao a research scientist at the harvard school of public health and an associate epidemiologist at harvard medical school and brigham and women s hospital in boston berries could be a neuroprotective agent people can include berries in their regular diet there are no harmful effects from berry consumption and they lower the risk of hypertension too gao added results of the study are published online april in the journal neurology parkinson s disease is a degenerative condition that affects the central nervous system it causes movement disorders such as tremors rigidity and balance problems about americans have parkinson s disease according to the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke flavonoids are substances found in plant foods that help prevent damage to the body s cells known as oxidative damage anthocyanins are a type of flavonoid plentiful in such berries as strawberries and blueberries for the study the researchers reviewed nutrition and health data from almost men enrolled in the health professional follow up study and more than women participating in the nurses health study the researchers looked at dietary intake of five major flavonoid sources tea berries apples orange juice and red wine over to years of follow up people developed parkinson s disease men and women when researchers compared those who ate the most flavonoids with those who ate the least they found that only men saw a statistically significant benefit lowering their risk of parkinson s by percent gao said it wasn t clear why only men benefited from the extra flavonoid intake but he noted that other studies have also found differences between men and women gao said it s not clear if there s a biological mechanism causing these differences or another factor but when the researchers looked at the dietary compounds individually it was clear that berries could benefit both men and women lowering the risk of parkinson s disease by about percent for those who had at least two servings of berries a week gao said that anthocyanins protect the cells from oxidative damage and they also have an anti inflammatory effect which may be how berries help to reduce parkinson s risk the study findings should be interpreted cautiously because the participants were mostly white professionals and the results might not apply to other ethnic groups also recollections of dietary intake may be faulty and it s possible that other properties of fruits and vegetables might have influenced the results the authors said dr michael okun medical director of the national parkinson foundation said it is exciting to see research emerging about modifiable dietary issues that may affect the risk of getting diseases such as parkinson s but he added it s important for people to realize that this research isn t applicable to people who already have the disease he also said it will be important to confirm these findings in other studies and learn the mechanism of how berries and other flavonoids appear to offer some protection against parkinson s disease more information learn more about parkinson s disease from the national institute of neurological disorders and stroke,1
saturday march healthday news a noninvasive scan might someday help doctors track the progress of prostate cancer and help guide treatment researchers report the imaging tool known as a prostate cancer specific radiotracer has so far only been tested successfully in mice but a team from memorial sloan kettering cancer center in new york city said the technology could help identify cases where prostate cancer has spread to the bone radiotracers work by injecting a small amount of a compound tagged with a radionuclide into patients using positron emission tomography also known as a pet scan doctors are then able to better visualize tumors and tumor spread in studies involving mice with prostate cancer the researchers had the radiotracer hone in on prostate specific antigen psa the same prostate cancer marker used in the psa test they found that the psa gravitated to tissues containing prostate cancer that had already grown resistant to standard hormone based therapies the study also revealed the radiotracer could help identify cases where prostate cancer had spread to the bone the researchers pointed out traditional bone scans are unable to differentiate between malignant and nonmalignant lesions the findings were to be presented saturday at the american association for cancer research annual meeting in chicago and are also being published in cancer discovery if used on people the researchers claimed that the radiotracer might someday help doctors personalize treatment strategies for prostate cancer and better manage the disease the ultimate goal is to be able to predict the response of patients to new and existing therapies at an early stage thereby personalizing their treatment and improving outcomes michael j evans research fellow in the human oncology and pathogenesis program at memorial sloan kettering cancer center explained in meeting news release encouraged by their findings the study s authors said they hope to begin a human trial next year two prostate cancer experts said the tool if borne out in patients could prove very useful dr michael schwartz is director of laparoscopy and minimally invasive surgery at north shore lij health system in lake success n y he noted that as of now doctors typically rely on results of the psa blood test and or standard diagnostic scans to help guide treatment decisions both methods have their limits and while this study is very preliminary if this radiotracer technology can prove to detect very early recurrence or metastasis in human patients it could become extremely useful in either the pre or post treatment setting in selecting a treatment algorithm schwartz said it also may help reduce the need for biopsy of possible metastatic lesions dr erik goluboff an attending urologist at beth israel medical center new york city agreed that this is an exciting study using a novel radiotracer to detect psa expressing tissues throughout the body he believes that the new tool s greatest strength would be in monitoring changes in psa expression in tissues as a result of various treatments if a treatment showed a marked change it could continue to be used in that patient hence personalized medicine if a specific change did not occur that treatment could be abandoned and another tried instead since these changes could not be detected based on a psa blood test alone this new test would be very helpful in determining early on which therapy to choose in a given patient however goluboff also noted that research from animal based studies does not always pan out in humans and further larger studies are of course required to confirm these findings more information the u s national cancer institute provides more information on prostate cancer,1
hong kong reuters boosting the effect of acupuncture needles with small electric currents may be effective in treating depression a study in hong kong has found led by zhang zhang jin at the school of chinese medicine university of hong kong the researchers used electroacupuncture to stimulate seven spots on the heads of participants who had suffered several bouts of depression in the last years the electroacupuncture was given in addition to medication that the patients were already taking and meant to augment their treatment zhang told a news conference half the patients received electroacupuncture nine times over three weeks while the other half the placebo group only had needles inserted superficially into their heads they were later assessed by experts for their depression levels and the group that received genuine electroacupuncture was found to be a lot happier the drop in depression scores among the group receiving active treatment was more significant than the placebo group said roger ng another researcher in the group which published their findings in the journal plos public library of science one when the acupoints are stimulated some brain centres responsible for producing serotonin are stimulated explained ng a consultant at the department of psychiatry at the kowloon hospital in hong kong an imbalance in serotonin levels is believed to be linked to depression depression affects about percent of people at some point in their lives the world health organisation predicts that by depression will rival heart disease as the health disorder with the highest disease burden in the world zhang said his group may consider moving into another trial using only electroacupuncture on patients suffering milder depression,0
when roasted at degrees coffee beans are sometimes described as rich and full bodied but for the full bodied person who is not so rich unroasted coffee beans green as the day they were picked may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss new research suggests in a study presented tuesday at the american chemical society s spring national meeting in san diego overweight young adults took by turns a low dose of green coffee bean extract a high dose of the supplement and a placebo though the study was small the results were striking subjects lost an average of pounds in weeks and reduced their overall body weight by if green coffee extract were a medication seeking approval from the food and drug administration these results would make it a viable candidate more than of subjects lost more than of their body weight and weight loss appeared to be greater while subjects were taking the pills than when they were on the placebo but as a dietary supplement green coffee extract does not require the fda s blessing in fact it is already available as a naturopathic medicine and antioxidant advertisement joe vinson the university of scranton chemist who conducted the pilot study said the findings should pave the way for more rigorous research on coffee bean extract s effects a larger trial involving people is being planned vinson whose research focuses on plant polyphenols and their effects on human health said it appears that green coffee bean extract may work by reducing the absorption of fat and glucose in the gut it may also reduce insulin levels which would improve metabolic function there were no signs of ill effects on any subjects vinson reported tuesday the study used a cross over design which allowed each subject to serve as his or her own comparison group for six weeks volunteers swallowed capsules three times a day ingesting either or milligrams of green coffee extract a day or taking a placebo after a two week break they moved round robin style to another arm of the trial subjects did not change their calorie intake over the course of the trial but the more extract they consumed the more weight and fat they lost altogether they reduced their body fat by on average advertisement of the volunteers six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range one downside is that the extract is extremely bitter it would be difficult to take without a lot of water vinson reported at roughly per month however green coffee extract is much less expensive than any of the weight loss medications available over the counter or by prescription the trial was conducted in india and paid for by applied food sciences inc of austin tex a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract the pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren t involved in the research this is certainly a provocative study said dr gerald weissmann a physician and biochemist at new york university but he said nutrition experts would want assurances that green coffee beans do not cause malabsorption within the human gut a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition heart arrhythmias and other problems because vitamins and minerals are not passing through the intestine dr arthur grollman a pharmacologist at the state university of new york at stony brook said coffee beans contain about different chemicals some with positive and others with negative effects on human health though vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss grollman said that claim needed further study in the meantime he said consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do,1
en español by alan mozes healthday reporter tuesday march healthday news when taken as a supplement unroasted or green coffee bean extract can help people shed pounds according to a small preliminary study the research which is being presented this week at the national meeting of the american chemical society in san diego involved just overweight and obese patients who were given daily doses of green coffee extract in capsule form all the patients were instructed to maintain their usual dietary habits while the study team monitored them for weight loss over a period of nearly six months the apparent result daily consumption of a small amount of green coffee extract translated into a nearly percent drop in body weight on average the study was conducted in india and funded by applied food sciences the american manufacturer of two green coffee extract products it has not been published in a journal and therefore has yet to undergo peer review supplements of this kind however are not subject to the rigorous u s food and drug administration safety and efficacy testing typically applied to all pharmaceutical medications this was indeed a small study acknowledged corresponding study author joe vinson a professor of chemistry at the university of scranton in pennsylvania but he noted that prior research has been conducted in both france and japan those studies demonstrated that patients experienced somewhat mild weight loss but here with higher extract doses than have been used before the patients experienced what i would call rather large weight loss while this of course needs to be confirmed with follow up i do think the subject is absolutely worthy of further exploration vinson added vinson said his team was not focused on the weight loss impact of caffeine as much as that of unprocessed unroasted coffee s primary ingredient chlorogenic acid that s the main natural compound in unroasted coffee and roasted coffee has much much less of it than unprocessed coffee vinson said so we re not talking about something that is interchangeable with the coffee we drink which is produced by roasting beans at a temperature between and degrees fahrenheit green coffee bean extracts are sold online at prices ranging from about to for capsules the study was broken into three six week sections in one section study participants who were all between the ages of and consumed a capsule filled with milligrams of green coffee extract in the second section participants took a milligram capsule the third section had participants taking a placebo each patient ultimately cycled through each section while maintaining their pre study dietary and exercise regimens the patients lost an average of pounds by the study s close on average patients lost percent and percent of their body weight and body fat respectively basically there was steady weight loss without side effects while the active green coffee extract was being taken at either dose vinson said a follow up study involving patients is now in the planning stages lona sandon a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the university of texas southwestern in dallas cautioned that the study is short on specifics making it difficult to draw any conclusions first of all you need more than people to have any statistical significance attached to these findings sandon said and we really have no idea how this might be working for example the patients were allowed to continue with their regular diet but did this extract in any way influence their hunger and what they wanted to eat and then what they actually ate we don t know what we have here is basically just a hypothesis that there s something about this compound that could be helpful just because it might cause weight loss doesn t mean it s healthy she warned because supplements are not regulated as drugs they can be put on the market with no safety or efficacy testing they don t even necessarily have to be tested for purity that means that in the past various weight loss supplements have been found to contain weight loss drugs or other drugs at higher doses than what would be allowed in a prescription dose sandon added so while people might have this perception that it s all natural since it s coming from a coffee bean with supplements in general it s still a buyer beware market more information for more on dietary supplements visit the office of dietary supplements of the u s national institutes of health,1

march a new prescription gel may quickly treat a common precancerous skin condition called actinic keratosis a new study shows the gel is derived from the sap of the euphorbia peplus plant this has long been used as a folk remedy for skin lesions the new findings are published in the new england journal of medicine actinic keratoses are typically red scaly skin lesions that can over time develop into a type of skin cancer they can often be found on sun exposed areas of the body such as the face scalp arms and legs the new gel picato ingenol mebutate is applied once daily for two or three days depending on the area being treated other available topical treatments must be used for several weeks and often irritate the skin cryotherapy or freezing the affected skin area is also used but can sometimes leave a scar because the new gel is only used for a few days any irritation is usually short lived the short duration also makes people more likely to stay the course another advantage according to the study s authors the shorter application period is what makes ingenol mebutate a breakthrough in the treatment of actinic keratosis researcher mark lebwohl md says in a news release he is a professor and chair of the department of dermatology at mount sinai school of medicine in new york city the new study included people with actinic keratoses on their face or scalp and people with these lesions on their mid section or arms and legs half got the new gel and the other half received an inactive placebo at the end of the two month study of people in the first group and of those in the second group who got the new gel showed complete clearance of their lesions by contrast only and respectively of the people who received the placebo had complete clearance the new study was funded by picato manufacturer leo pharma,0
they don t call it the big c for nothing people don t even like to say the word out loud the good news we re told is that there are many things we can do or not do in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer want to avoid lung cancer don t smoke want to lower your risk of skin cancer stay out of the sun or utilize a proper sunscreen but a new study published monday in cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make for us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer researchers at the university of washington school of medicine and the fred hutchinson cancer research center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer they concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer it s important to note right off the bat that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship as is often the case there are many additional factors at play first a bit of background it has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections as the study s authors point out the mechanism s by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an sti sexually transmitted infection is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin this tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream furthermore the moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection circumcision of course removes this protective environment why is this important infections are reported to cause almost of cancers worldwide either directly by infection or indirectly via inflammation several stis such as gonorrhea chlamydia hpv hiv have been found in the prostate participants in the study were asked about their family s medical history which may increase a man s risk of developing prostate cancer and their psa screening history which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition men were also asked to self report their circumcision status number of sexual partners and their history of stis circumcision was reported in of the cases and of the controls caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision than african american men for who reported circumcision the procedure was performed shortly after birth a few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self reporting when it comes to a man s history of stis as well as his sexual partners a cursory review of the data suggests for example that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported male to male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in stis including hiv this gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported though the numbers of circumcised vs not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results the bottom line from the american cancer society while this is an interesting finding it s not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice,1
by denise mann healthday reporter monday march healthday news people taking popular cholesterol lowering drugs called statins may have a slightly lower risk than others of developing parkinson s disease new research suggests this effect may be even more pronounced among people younger than according to the study published in the march issue of archives of neurology however the risk reduction was modest and may have been due to chance the authors said noting that more research is warranted especially because statins can cause adverse side effects there is no clear verdict said dr stuart isaacson director of the parkinson s disease and movement disorders center of boca raton who was not involved in the study right now we don t have any good evidence that there is anything we can do to reduce the risk of developing parkinson s disease but research is ongoing added isaacson also an associate professor of neurology at florida international university s herbert wertheim college of medicine in miami for the study researchers led by dr xiang gao of brigham and women s hospital and harvard university school of public health in boston analyzed data on more than men and almost women enrolled in the health professionals follow up study and the nurses health study in during years of follow up people were diagnosed with parkinson s disease people taking cholesterol lowering drugs especially those younger than were less likely to develop the neurological disorder than those not using cholesterol drugs the researchers found nearly one million people in the united states have parkinson s disease a chronic and progressive movement disorder and no one knows what causes it the researchers can t say exactly how or even if statins reduce the risk of parkinson s it s thought these drugs may have potent anti inflammatory effects which could protect the brain the study had some limitations the authors acknowledged for example only about percent of people who were taking drugs to lower cholesterol were actually on statins at the study s start dr roy alcalay an assistant professor of neurology at columbia university medical center in new york city said it is way too early to say that statins lower risk for parkinson s disease this is a promising avenue for future research said alcalay an advisor for the parkinson s disease foundation but there is some good news he added the data are compelling evidence that statins are not detrimental for people with or at risk of parkinson s disease he said there was a concern that statins could be harmful as they might lower the level of coenzyme q in the blood co q an antioxidant is thought to have benefits for people with parkinson s disease if you need to be on statins for your heart it is not going to increase your risk for parkinson s alcalay said more information learn more about parkinson s disease and its symptoms at the parkinson s disease foundation,1
food allergies are tricky business they re on the rise in the united states and no one knows why some children are allergic to many foods and it s impossible to know based on preventive testing whether someone will have a mild or severe reaction and so far there s no cure researchers at johns hopkins university and duke university are working on a treatment that may one day allow kids with allergies to safely eat the foods that cause them life threatening reactions it s still in the early stages but dr robert wood of johns hopkins who has been on the forefront of food allergy research estimates the treatment could be brought to the public within six to eight years in his new study researchers explored a treatment for children with cow s milk allergies the strategy is to desensitize the child by giving small amounts of the allergen milk oral immunotherapy swallowing small amounts of the allergen has shown to be more effective than sublingual therapy which involves putting even tinier quantities of milk under the person s tongue wood and colleagues found promising results from this small experiment with children ages to these kids were severely allergic to cow s milk wood presented the study published in the journal of allergy and clinical immunology at the annual meeting of the american academy of allergy asthma immunology this weekend the results suggested that children who went through a year of sublingual therapy followed by one to two years of oral immunotherapy were less likely to have significant allergic reactions when undergoing the oral immunotherapy still it did not eliminate all symptoms this is particularly important because about of the kids that wood and colleagues work with have significant reactions during the treatment that make the therapy unfeasible wood said some participants have shown they can safely eat milk products up to a year after stopping the therapies wood said but only one third have longterm protection others need regular exposure to milk in order to maintain protection against allergic reactions with milk that s not too hard wood says because one could eat pizza a couple of times a week it s not known yet whether children respond better to this kind of treatment than adults since there have been so few participants in this research the big barrier to broadening the scope of the research is funding wood said this is the first time the sublingual therapy has been studied in terms of its benefit as a precursor to the oral immunotherapy wood said other research has shown that immunotherapy techniques may similarly work for children with peanut allergies but tree nuts may be harder to treat wood said because tree nut allergic individuals often have multiple kinds of nuts they can t eat researchers are separately looking at a drug called omalizumab xolair approved by the u s food and drug administration for the treatment of severe asthma to see if it could help people with food allergies too do not try the immunotherapy technique at home these experiments are conducted under medical supervision,1

a new study has found that consumption of omega fatty acids from fish is associated with a reduced risk for one kind of colon polyp but only in women animal studies have suggested that omega fatty acids may have anti cancer effects but the results from human epidemiological studies have been inconclusive for this case control study researchers recruited colonoscopy patients percent of them men at two tennessee hospitals over a seven year period ending in april the analysis appears online in the american journal of clinical nutrition they found people with polyps leaving polyp free controls all patients were interviewed about diet health habits and medical history after controlling for age race body mass index smoking and other factors the researchers found that women in the highest fifth for omega consumption those who consumed three or more servings of fish a week were percent less likely than women in the lowest fifth to have adenomatous polyps a type likely to become cancerous the researchers found no effect in men and no effect of omega consumption on hyperplastic polyps which are more likely to be benign this is more evidence to suggest that omega s are beneficial and may have anti inflammatory action helpful in reducing cancer risk said the lead author dr harvey j murff an associate professor of medicine at vanderbilt,1
weight loss drugs face high hurdles at fda enlarge this image toggle caption m spencer green ap m spencer green ap tammy wade knew she had to try something else to lose weight when she stepped on the scale and saw the number pounds wade of mccalla ala is only feet inches tall she had tried everything nothing worked i had problems with my feet and ankles and they were saying i was borderline diabetic wade says i m like well i gotta do something you know so i needed really did need to lose the weight so wade volunteered to help test qnexa an experimental drug pending before the food and drug administration she quickly noticed a big difference i didn t feel ravenous and i didn t want to snack all day long she says over the next year qnexa helped wade slowly drop about pounds and keep it off for another year it makes you feel so much better wade says your back don t hurt your feet don t hurt but the fda rejected qnexa in because of concerns about side effects especially possible heart problems and birth defects fda briefing documents released update feb a m the fda posted a page review of the possible risks and benefits of qnexa on the agency s website the review noted continued concerns that qnexa can increase the risk for several possible side effects including increased heart rate birth defects and thinking problems such as memory lapses and confusion but the agency also noted qnexa does appear to help many people lose at percent of their body weight in addition it was somewhat reassuring that the drug also appears to produce some health benefits beyond weight loss including lower blood pressure among the questions the agency plans to ask an advisory committee meeting feb to review the drug is whether vivus inc which makes qnexa should conduct a study better assessing the drug s affect on the heart before the drug is approved in its own page review vivus called qnexa a significant advancement in the medical treatment of obesity and detailed the potential benefits of the drug the company also outlined a plan to minimize the chances that women of childbearing age would take it qnexa s rejection came amid a flurry of failed attempts by drug companies to win approvals of new weight loss drugs the setbacks put a spotlight on how the fda handles these drugs even though obesity is at epidemic levels the fda hasn t approved any new weight loss medicines since we have two thirds of all americans who are overweight or obese and the costs are nearing billion a year says christine ferguson a health policy professor at george washington university the sheer magnitude of the problem really requires us to address it more aggressively and thoughtfully than we have ferguson has been helping to organize a series of meetings involving public health experts anti obesity advocates government officials and others to try to figure out what the fda should do we actually have this huge gap says joe nadglowski of the obesity action coalition who has been participating in the meetings we go from weight watchers to bariatric surgery and the fact that there isn t medical treatments for obesity including pharmaceuticals really is a challenge considering how big the problem is in this country part of what s going on is that the fda has gotten a lot more cautious about approving new drugs in general after some serious drug safety problems such as heart problems linked to the painkiller vioxx the fda has been especially tough on weight loss drugs because of previous problems with those drugs such as the diet drug cocktail fen phen there s been a long history with obesity drugs that we ve had to take off the market you recall the fen phen episode where a significant number of people got heart valve defects says janet woodcock a top fda official woodcock argues that the agency has to be extra careful with weight loss drugs because chances are it won t just be obese people taking them when you re talking about a drug where it could go into literally tens of millions of americans there has to be attention to safety woodcock says what might look like a rare problem now could turn into another public health disaster she says but some say the agency s aversion to accepting any risks is outdated they say the fda wrongly still tends to view weight loss drugs as diet pills something frivolous and used primarily for cosmetic purposes we are not talking about medications to help someone lose five pounds to fit into their prom dress or wedding dress we re talking about medications to help those who are struggling with the health impact of obesity nadglowski says so nadglowski and others are pushing the fda to take into consideration whether the risks of new drugs may be outweighed by their benefits beyond weight loss such as reducing the risk for heart disease diabetes and other complications of obesity woodcock says officials realize they may have to think about things differently as the fda works through this many are watching how the agency handles qnexa an fda advisory panel is scheduled to review qnexa again on feb barbara troupin of vivus the company that is developing qnexa says the drug appears to do a lot more than just help people lose weight we see decreases in blood pressure we see decreased rates of progression to diabetes we see improvements in sleep apnea we see improvements in quality of life pretty much all of our data shows significant benefits she says vivus hopes the fda will agree that those benefits will outweigh some of the risks including the concerns about birth defects the company is submitting new data it says show that the risk is lower than had been feared vivus also has a plan to minimize the chances that pregnant women will take it

smokers who count on nicotine patches or gum to help them quit may want to reconsider a new study finds that these and other nicotine replacement products aren t effective at preventing former smokers from relapsing in real world conditions among adults who had quit smoking within the previous two years nearly a third reported having returned to using cigarettes according to a study published online monday by the journal tobacco control those who had used nicotine patches gum inhalers or nasal sprays were just as likely to relapse as those who had quit without them researchers from harvard university and the university of massachusetts found the findings run counter to the results of several randomized clinical trials conducted before the food and drug administration gave the thumbs up to these nicotine replacement products in the s in those trials volunteers using such products were up to three times more likely to kick the smoking habit but the latest results are in line with other studies that have found little if any benefit from the products when used by smokers in real life in some cases studies have found that people who use products like nicotine patches and gums are more likely to relapse than their counterparts who go cold turkey advertisement this may indicate that some heavily dependent smokers perceive nrt nicotine replacement therapy as a sort of magic pill and upon realizing it is not they find themselves without support in their quitting efforts doomed to failure the researchers wrote the new study examined former smokers three times over a five year period at the midpoint of the study of recent quitters had gone back to smoking by the end had relapsed american smokers spend more than billion on nicotine gum patches and related products each year according to the study much of that comes from public health programs which are facing further rounds of budget cuts policymakers ought to rethink their willingness to pay for nicotine replacement therapy the researchers wrote and consider shifting that money to initiatives aimed at discouraging smoking in general such as anti smoking campaigns and efforts to raise tobacco taxes but glaxosmithkline consumer healthcare which makes nicorette nicoderm commit lozenges and other smoking cessation products said that would be premature the company noted that most of the adults in the study who used nicotine replacement products didn t use them for the recommended eight weeks had those people followed directions they might have had more success advertisement hundreds of clinical trials involving more than participants and extensive consumer use for more than years have proven both the efficacy and safety of nrt when used as directed the company said in a statement nrt products have helped millions of smokers quit by gradually weaning them off of their tobacco addiction and is recommended as a first line therapy for quitting,1
in a study suggesting that red wine might be the next big thing in breast cancer prevention a study has found that women who drank just under two servings of red wine daily experienced hormonal changes that mimic the effects of a drug used to prevent malignant breast tumors from coming back the study published friday in the journal of women s health found that consuming the same amount of white wine did not have the same effect in premenopausal women participating in the study women intent on warding off breast cancer have been warned about alcohol consumption as recently as november a study found that women who consumed as few as three servings of alcohol a week increased their risk of developing the disease which strikes one in eight american women at some point in life white wine and other alcoholic beverages are believed to promote the conversion of androgens male hormones such as testosterone which circulate in all women s blood into estrogen and the greater a woman s lifetime exposure to estrogen whether her own or estrogen that comes from medication or environmental sources the higher her risk of developing breast cancer advertisement but red wine acts differently the present study found instead of promoting the conversion of androgens to estrogen in a woman s body red wine appears to block that process in that sense it acts more like a class of drug called aromatase inhibitors which are prescribed to most women who have been diagnosed with breast cancer to prevent recurrences it s not the alcohol in red wine that appears to conjure such magic it s the phytochemicals which also are found in grapes grape juice and grape seed extract resveratrol one of the phytochemicals found plentifully in red wine has been linked to a host of disease preventing processes researchers led by a team from cedars sinai s heart institute and medical center found that study participants who drank eight ounces of red wine daily the equivalent of almost two servings at five ounces per serving showed a significantly different mix of seven sex hormones than those who drank the same amount of white wine among the red wine drinkers estrogen levels were lower and androgen levels were higher the current study was small women with an average age of participated each drank eight ounces nightly of cabernet sauvignon wine for most of a single menstrual cycle then drank no alcohol for a little over a week and then drank eight ounces of chardonnay nightly for roughly the next days advertisement the authors asserted this was the first rigorous study to find that red wine is a nutritional aromatase inhibitor in healthy premenopausal women another study has found that women who drank more red wine showed less breast density on mammograms an emerging marker for breast cancer risk than those who drank other forms of alcohol l chaim,1

could a vitamin make antidepressants work better that s the tantalizing premise behind deplin a prescription form of the b vitamin folate although it has been on the market since deplin is generating growing buzz at psychiatric conferences and among clinicians and patients particularly those who haven t responded to antidepressants or did for a while only to have their depression return many of the patients i put on deplin come back and say wow my medication is working again or hey doc this medicine never worked this well before says psychiatrist thor bergersen who practices in needham mass and new york city it s long been known that folate found naturally in green leafy vegetables legumes nuts and some fruits is important for cell growth and brain function how and why is now becoming clearer recent research has found that the body converts folate and folic acid the synthetic version into an active form called l methylfolate which is needed to produce serotonin dopamine and norepinephrine three neurotransmitters that are critical in regulating mood trial and error for many patients treating depression involves trying multiple drugs over a long period of time nearly million people in the u s suffer depression during their lifetime of americans over age take antidepressants only get well on the first antidepressant alone up to of patients never reach remission people with low folate levels are six times as likely to fail to respond to antidepressants as those with normal levels sources cdc nimh journal of clinical psychopharmacology aging illness genetics poor nutrition excess alcohol consumption and some medications can all reduce l methylfolate levels leaving those neurotransmitters in short supply some researchers say while many popular antidepressants slow the reuptake of serotonin or norepinephrine making them available longer to the brain such drugs may not work for long or at all if the brain isn t producing sufficient quantities of the neurotransmitters in the first place some experts theorize this is a totally new way to look at depression we may be getting at the very foundation of why many people never achieve a full remission says john zajecka director of the depression treatment research center at rush university medical center in chicago dr zajecka has helped investigate deplin and is on the speakers bureau for its maker pamlab llc of covington la pamlab officials say that deplin which contains l methylfolate can directly supply what some people need to make sufficient quantities of neurotransmitters that regulate mood and it does so more efficiently than taking extra folic acid which still needs to be converted they say as convincing as that sounds clinical evidence is limited pamlab which currently has the market to itself sells deplin as a medical food a category that isn t held to the same standards the food and drug administration demands of new drugs medical foods are intended to provide dietary management for a disease or condition all ingredients must be generally recognized as safe and physician supervision is required nearly clinicians have prescribed deplin in the past three years according to pamlab and monthly prescriptions grew to nearly in october from january still that s a tiny fraction of the more than million prescriptions for antidepressants every month in the u s just two randomized placebo controlled trials have evaluated deplin with a total of subjects both were supported by pamlab in one study presented at the american psychiatric association s meeting in may depressed patients were randomly assigned to take either milligrams of deplin or a placebo along with an antidepressant after days of subjects on deplin had responded compared with on the placebo however an earlier study using a lower dose of deplin found no difference with a placebo subjects reported no more side effects with deplin than with the placebo in either trial about folate folate a b vitamin found naturally in some foods is needed to maintain cell growth and brain function deficiencies are associated with depression certain types of anemia and birth defects poor diet aging illness alcoholism and some medications can lower folate levels folic acid is the synthetic form of folate found in supplements and used to fortify grains l methylfolate the active form of folate helps produce the neurotransmitters critical to regulating mood about of americans have genetic variations that reduce their ability to create l methylfolate which may raise their risk of depression sources cns spectrum wsj reporting the biggest gripe with deplin is the cost one month s supply of deplin either at milligrams or milligrams can cost as much as and not all insurers cover it pamlab has a licensed generic version called simply l methylfolate that went on the market in august and is priced somewhat lower more insurers are covering that version some with copayments as low as says pamlab which also makes medical foods for managing other conditions including asthma pamlab officials say they hope eventually to win fda approval for deplin as a prescription drug the company says it plans to start phase ii trials later this year one branch of the trials will assess whether deplin could effectively treat depression on its own researchers also hope to determine which patients would benefit most from deplin to cut down on the frustrating trial and error process many people face in finding an effective antidepressant one target could be people who have a genetic variation that reduces their ability to make l methylfolate roughly of the u s population has one abnormal copy of the gene known as mthfr and has two abnormal copies giving them less than one third of the typical amount of l methylfolate researchers say but some people who had two normal copies of the mthfr gene also responded well to deplin so there are clearly other factors involved as well says harold koch pamlab s chief scientific officer despite the uncertainties some clinicians say they are comfortable prescribing deplin i have had people write me thank you notes because it s given them a boost of energy and happiness says judy paley an internist in denver colo my patients who have responded are not people who are suggestible they ve been trying different medications for years says andres san martin a manhattan psychiatrist who specializes in treating resistant depression other experts are more cautious it doesn t appear to have a lot of downsides but sometimes it takes a few years of use

en español thursday dec healthday news concentrating on music can provide enough distraction to ease the pain of people with significant anxiety according to a new study researchers from the university of utah pain research center studied the effectiveness of music as a pain reliever on study participants the volunteers were asked to follow a melody so they could identify the tones that stood out while tackling the assignment they received safe pain shocks with fingertip electrodes the study published in the december issue of the journal of pain found that pain was reduced as the demands of the music task rose the researchers explained that the music competed with the participants pain pathways by triggering emotional responses and engaging the participants minds the music task helped to ease their pain participants with the most anxiety about the pain became more engrossed in the music listening task than those who were less anxious according to a journal news release the study authors suggested that experiencing little anxiety lowered the participants ability to focus on the task the researchers concluded that people with a lot of anxiety who can become preoccupied by activities such as listening to music can reduce discomfort by using this type of pain relief strategy doctors should take patients personality traits into consideration before suggesting pain therapies such as music the authors said more information the american music therapy association provides more information on music therapy,0
en español by denise mann healthday reporter tuesday dec healthday news a new test measuring levels of troponin i in the blood may help determine whether someone is really having a heart attack earlier than is currently possible troponin i is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle has been damaged such as during a heart attack the more damage there is to the heart the more troponin there will be in the blood existing tests measure troponin t or troponin i the new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin i test that may be more accurate in less time the findings appear in the dec issue of the journal of the american medical association researchers led by dr till keller at the university heart center in hamburg germany compared the new highly sensitive troponin i test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack of these were deemed to be having a heart attack the troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis the study showed the new test was more sensitive than the existing one this means that if a test result is negative the person is not having a heart attack another measure specificity rules in disease with a high degree of confidence the issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next to hours for accurate readings the new test yields sensitive results in three hours the study was partially funded by brahms ag and abbott diagnostics abbott diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study we can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test said dr sandra chaparro a cardiologist at the university of miami hospital in florida if the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack many people come to the emergency room with chest pain typically the doctor orders an electrocardiogram ekg to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart along with blood work not all ekg readings are abnormal during a heart attack chaparro explained this is where the blood test would be used it is very common to have people going to the hospital with chest pain and it could be something important or something not significant she said a more sensitive test could save a lot of money she noted dr michael lanigan an emergency room doctor at the suny downstate medical center in brooklyn nyc said the ultimate goal is a highly specific and sensitive test that can tell doctors right away if you are having a heart attack the new test helps push the envelope further he said we need a blood test that can tell people when they walk in or soon thereafter that they are having a heart attack because the sooner you make the diagnosis the sooner you can start the right therapy more information for more on the different types of troponin tests visit the u s national institutes of health,1
london reuters a hormone called dhea and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to help women who are going through menopause and could also give them better sex lives a study found on tuesday italian researchers writing in the journal of the international menopause society climacteric said they had found the first robust evidence that low doses of dhea can help sexual function and menopausal symptoms suggesting it may one day become an alternative to hormone replacement therapy hrt but they stressed that the trial was small so far larger studies are needed to confirm the results we must bear in mind that this is a pilot study with a small sample anna fenton co editor of climacteric said in commentary on the work we can t yet say that this study means that dhea is a viable alternative to hrt but we should be looking to do larger studies to confirm these initial results dhea or dehydroepiandrosterone is a natural steroid hormone mostly made in the adrenal glands and has a variety of therapeutic uses hrt which is a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone is an approved treatment for women going through the menopause who often experience unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes night sweats loss of sex drive and mood swings but sales of hrt drugs have fallen sharply since a large study in found higher rates of ovarian cancer breast cancer and strokes in women who took the pills and the search has since been on for alternatives american researchers said in january that the antidepressant lexapro made by drugmaker forest laboratories significantly cut the number and severity of hot flushes in menopausal women and other antidepressants including glaxosmithkline s paxil and the pfizer drugs prozac and effexor also have been found to be effective for this trial a team of researchers led by andrea genazzani of the university of pisa followed a group of post menopausal women with troubling symptoms over a year women took vitamin d and calcium took dhea took standard hrt and took a synthetic steroid called tibolone which is used to alleviate menopausal symptoms the women s menopausal symptoms sexual interest and activity were measured using a standard questionnaire that explores factors such as satisfaction with frequency of sex vaginal lubrication orgasm and sexual partner after months all the women on hormone replacements had improvements in menopausal symptoms but those taking vitamin d and calcium did not show any significant improvement at the start of the trial all groups had similar sexual activity but after the year those taking calcium and vitamin d scored an average of on the questionnaire scale while those taking dhea had a score of showing that those on dhea had more sexual interest and activity the results for the hrt group were similar and both the hrt dhea groups showed a higher level of sexual intercourse in comparison to the control group the researchers said genazzani said the results showed dhea has potential especially for those women who may have problems in taking more conventional hrt but this is a small study a proof of concept what we need to do now is to look at a larger study to confirm that these initial results are valid she added,1

by amanda gardner healthday reporter monday oct healthday news women who undergo mammograms every two years instead of every year have fewer false positive results but the trade off is a slightly higher risk of being diagnosed with late stage breast cancer new research finds after years biennial mammograms reduced the risk of false positives by about one third and over a lifetime that would accumulate said rebecca hubbard lead author of a study published in the oct issue of annals of internal medicine and funded by the u s national cancer institute but the increase in breast cancer diagnoses wasn t statistically significant she said and breast cancer stage was only analyzed in women who actually developed cancer on the other hand among roughly women screened between and and followed for a decade more than half who received annual mammograms were called back at least once because of a false positive result and to percent were recommended to get a biopsy fewer women about percent who had biennial screening were called back because of a false positive while percent were referred for a biopsy having a previous mammogram for comparison purposes sliced the rate of false positives in half for the study researchers used data from nci s breast cancer surveillance consortium women undergoing once yearly mammograms need to be prepared for possible call backs and being prepared may reduce the anxiety around such an event the authors stated this is the latest volley in an ongoing debate about when to start mammography screening in women in the u s preventative services task force uspstf a government sponsored organization startled the world by recommending that women start mammograms at age instead of and then only once every two years rather than once a year the move released an outcry in the medical community leading to this and other studies to try to determine the best timing for mammograms the only screening tool shown to reduce deaths from breast cancer the new study gives a nod in the direction of the upstf recommendations but practitioners aren t necessarily ready to let go of the long standing once a year recommendation hubbard an assistant investigator with group health research institute in seattle wash said she definitely wouldn t make a specific recommendation for individual women i feel it s really an individual choice where a woman needs to think about her own risk tolerance and also their own breast cancer risk this gives women more information as to what the risks and benefits of mammography are added dr stephanie bernik chief of surgical oncology at lenox hill hospital in new york city it s a personal choice as to whether or not you absolutely have to screen at as breast surgeons we re still going to advocate that mammograms start at a second study in the same journal issue looked at more than u s women screened from to and found that newer digital mammography and older film mammography were similarly accurate in finding cancer in women ages through but in premenopausal women in their s who tend to have denser breast tissue digital mammography performed better again though the risk of false positives was higher than with film mammography there was a trade off here as well said hubbard who was also an author of this study in general in women aged to the two modalities performed pretty equivalently but in younger women the sensitivity of digital mammography was a little bit better so it found more cancers but there was also a bigger decrease in specificity resulting in more false positives more information the u s national cancer institute has more on mammography,1
researchers analyzed data from nearly women who had their first screening mammogram at age to years and almost women with invasive breast cancer information about the women and their mammograms came from the breast cancer surveillance consortium funded by the national cancer institute the task force says the decision to start regular biennial mammograms before age should be an individual choice based on each patient s situation meanwhile the american cancer society continues to recommend that women get mammograms every year beginning at age the frequency of screening mammograms and the appropriate age to begin them has been debated since the u s preventive services task force in recommended that women routinely get screening mammograms every other year starting at age oct getting screening mammograms every two years instead of annually reduces the chance of a false alarm a new study shows false positives are common after years of annual screening more than half of women will be called back at least once for another mammogram and to will be told they should have a biopsy because of something suspicious that turns out not to be cancer the researchers concluded those false positives may cause inconvenience and anxiety and biopsies can cause pain and scarring the researchers note they found a small but not significant increase in the chance that women diagnosed with breast cancer had a more advanced case if they underwent screening every other year instead of every year the study wasn t really designed to answer the question of which screening regimen is best study researcher rebecca hubbard phd says its main message hubbard says is that call backs or recalls for false positive results are common so women shouldn t panic when they occur in most cases a recall doesn t mean you have cancer says hubbard a biostatistician at the group health research institute in seattle hopefully there will be less anxiety about getting a recall women can halve their risk of a call back for a false positive if the interpreting radiologist has previous mammograms for comparison the researchers found ideally hubbard says primary care doctors should talk to women about what to expect from annual and biennial screening before they get their first mammogram,1

for women who like a nice glass of wine at the end of the day there s more good news even middle aged women can have about a drink a day of any kind of alcoholic beverage as part of what they do to try to stay healthy as they age according to new research qi sun of the harvard school of public health and his colleagues analyzed data collected from female nurses participating in the nurses health study an ongoing study examining a variety of health issues in a paper published online tuesday by the journal plos medicine the researchers found that those who consumed grams or less of alcohol a day which is the equivalent of one drink of any alcoholic beverage when they were about years old on average were more likely to have good overall health when they were about years old those who drank between one third and drink per day five to seven days a week were almost percent more likely to be in good health when they got older compared with those who did not imbibe that was after accounting for other factors such as smoking good overall health was defined as having no major chronic diseases such as heart disease or diabetes as well as having no significant decline in their thinking or physical abilities these data suggest that regular moderate consumption of alcohol at midlife may be related to a modest increase in overall health status among women who survive to older ages the researchers wrote now the researchers stressed that wasn t the case for women who consumed more than two drinks a day or four drinks or more at a time the findings fit with current federal dietary guidelines which recommend up to one drink per day for women and just to two drinks per day for men,1
sept a drink a day keeps disease away may be the new motto for middle age women hoping to age gracefully a new study shows women who drank the equivalent of a beer or small glass of wine each day were less likely to develop chronic diseases like heart disease cancer and diabetes as they got older compared to nondrinkers or those who drink four or more drinks at one time in the study researchers looked at the effects of drinking alcohol at midlife on the risk of diseases commonly associated with aging in a group of women enrolled in the nurses health study the women filled out questionnaires about what they ate and drank at midlife about age researchers then analyzed health status information collected after the women turned after taking into account other factors that might affect health and disease risk like smoking researchers found women who drank light or moderate amounts of alcohol were less likely to develop chronic diseases as they aged for example compared to nondrinkers women who drank up to one alcoholic drink per day were more likely to be disease free at age than nondrinkers,0
cracking the conundrum of chronic fatigue syndrome enlarge this image toggle caption istockphoto com istockphoto com nearly three decades have passed since the debate began about a series of symptoms that have come to be known as chronic fatigue syndrome its cause is still unknown but over the years researchers have identified various brain immune system and energy metabolism irregularities involved some patients describe the syndrome as feeling like an unrelenting unremitting flu doctors say some treatments can help arthur barsky a psychiatrist at brigham and women s hospital in boston and a professor at harvard medical school says patients need to change how they experience symptoms typically pain insomnia and anxiety when patients adopt a more positive attitude barsky points out it often translates into greater confidence and more energy a study published this year in the lancet found that a form of talk therapy as well as exercise offered relief for some patients researchers from the united kingdom looked at cognitive behavior therapy or cbt in the study over patients with chronic fatigue syndrome were assigned to different treatments all of them received medical care for symptoms like pain insomnia or anxiety hear joanne silberner s report medical mystery of chronic fatigue syndrome returns one group got counseled about how to pace activities another took part in an exercise program and a third received the cognitive behavioral talk therapy the therapy and the exercise group improved the most reporting less fatigue insomnia and anxiety barsky says his patients do best when cognitive behavior therapy is also combined with gradually increased exercise people need to begin to push themselves in the face of their fatigue because if you don t you become deconditioned and you get caught in a cycle which makes fatigue worse says barsky but he cautions against overdoing it people should start with mild gentle exercise like clearing the table doing the dishes or taking the dog for a short walk then slowly build up to longer and more frequent walks he says lucinda bateman is a doctor at the fatigue consultation clinic in salt lake city who specializes in chronic fatigue syndrome she s skeptical about the lancet study pointing out that patients improved only moderately and not much more than those who were counseled about pacing themselves bateman suggests her patients pace themselves and try to do only as many activities as they can manage she says some patients get caught in a push and crash cycle when symptoms abate and they feel better they may go all out exercising doing errands and socializing but soon that level of activity often comes to a crashing end and patients can relapse dramatically even becoming bedridden for several days or longer bateman takes also issue with cbt s implication that chronic fatigue syndrome is psychosomatic we still don t know what exactly causes the syndrome and like most professionals who treat patients bateman eagerly awaits the day when science can finally pinpoint its cause with additional reporting from joanne silberner,1
new york reuters health gentle yoga classes may help people with type diabetes take off a small amount of weight and steady their blood sugar control a small study suggests people perform yoga during a gathering calling for world peace at ibirapuera park in sao paulo august reuters nacho doce the study of middle aged and older adults found that those who added yoga classes to standard diabetes care shed a handful of pounds over three months meanwhile their average blood sugar levels held steady in contrast to the non yoga practicing control group whose blood sugar levels rose the findings reported in the journal diabetes care do not suggest that yoga should replace other forms of exercise for people with type diabetes a disease commonly associated with obesity to really lose weight and rein in blood sugar more vigorous exercise would work better according to shreelaxmi v hegde of the srinivas institute of medical science and research center in mangalore india among the study participants who took yoga classes several times a week the average bmi a measure of weight in relation to height declined from to a bmi between and is considered overweight in our study the effect of yoga on bmi body mass index and blood sugar control was marginal hegde the lead researcher on the work told reuters health in an email but she added it should be noted that yoga controlled the blood sugar levels which otherwise rose in the control group in addition to that the study found signs of so called oxidative stress declined in the yoga group oxidative stress refers to a situation where levels of reactive oxygen species or free radicals damaging byproducts of energy use in cells rise beyond the body s capacity to neutralize them long term oxidative stress is believed to contribute to a host of chronic diseases in this study hegde s team measured participants blood levels of certain chemicals that reflect oxidative stress they found that on average the yoga group s levels of the chemicals dipped by percent the significance of that is not clear hegde said that if such a decline in oxidative stress were sustained over time it might lower the chances of diabetes complications which include heart and kidney disease nerve damage and damage to the blood vessels of the eyes further long term studies are needed to see whether that is the case the researchers say according to hegde yoga may curb oxidative stress because it stimulates the parasympathetic nervous system the part of the nervous system that basically acts as a brake against the gas pedal of the sympathetic nervous system there are caveats the yoga used in this study was a gentle form hegde said and parts of the practice were adapted for people who had additional health problems certain poses were avoided in people who had heart disease for example in the real world yoga classes vary widely some are vigorous work outs involving complicated poses that would not be appropriate for older adults with chronic health conditions older adults with diabetes can look for yoga classes designed specifically for older people and those with chronic medical conditions in the u s hospitals and local community centers are increasingly offering such classes source bit ly qjgxz diabetes care online august,1
the goal of the project is to develop a simple accurate noninvasive and reproducible method for early identification of chronic heart failure he tells webmd we saw two distinct patterns one of which correlated with heart failure says study leader vasileios kechagias a phd candidate at the university hospital jena the device has gas sensors that detect various odorous molecules in sweat specially developed software divides patients into groups depending on the pattern of molecules detected aug paris german researchers say they re a step closer to developing an electronic nose that can distinguish between people who have heart failure and those who don t million have heart failure in u s more than million americans have heart failure which occurs when the heart muscle loses its ability to pump enough blood throughout the body fluid can back up into the lungs leaving people short of breath the new study involved people with heart failure so severe that they were comfortable only at rest people with less severe heart failure and healthy people the electronic nose correctly identified of the people who had heart failure and of people that didn t have the condition still that means that of cases would have been missed and of people would have been told they had a life threatening condition when they didn t the new device was about that accurate at differentiating between severe and less severe heart failure patients the findings were presented here at the european society of cardiology congress frank ruschitzka md of zurich university hospital tells webmd that ideas that at first seem crazy can turn out to be lifesaving we need people to swim against the stream someone had the idea to put three leads in a device and pace the heart the pacemaker now saves millions of lives he says still much more work is needed before we will know if the electronic nose will make it to the clinic says ruschitzka who moderated a news briefing to discuss the findings the researchers are now testing more than patients and trying to identify the odorous molecules unique to heart failure patients kechagias says,1
fred r conrad the new york times a new study reports that beer is an excellent recovery beverage for marathon runners but you may not want to start a raucous celebration just yet the beer was effective only if it was nonalcoholic running a marathon is of course punishing to the body causing muscle soreness and inflammation grueling exercise can also weaken the immune system making athletes susceptible to colds and other ills in the weeks after the event some athletes particularly in europe long had downed nonalcoholic beer during hard training claiming that it helped them to recover but no science existed to support the practice to study the matter researchers at the technical university of munich approached healthy male runners most in their early s who were training for the munich marathon and asked if they would in the name of science be willing to drink a considerable amount of beer two hundred seventy seven men agreed even when told that the beverage would be nonalcoholic only half of the group received the alcohol free beer however the other half got a similarly flavored placebo no one knew who was drinking what all of the runners downed a liter to a liter and a half about two to three pints of their assigned beverage every day beginning three weeks before the race and continuing for two weeks afterward the scientists meanwhile collected blood samples from the men several weeks before the race as well as immediately before to the start at the finish line and on select days afterward these were an exceptionally obliging group of racers it seems they monitored levels of various markers of inflammation in the men s blood to see whether beer helped to blunt some of the immediate damage from running for the next two weeks the men continued to dutifully swallow their nonalcoholic beer or other brew they also reported any symptoms of colds or other upper respiratory ailments that developed during that time the men drinking the nonalcoholic beer reported far fewer illnesses than the runners swallowing the placebo beverage incidence of upper respiratory tract infections was fold lower in the nonalcoholic beer drinkers the scientists reported in the journal medicine science in sports exercise they also showed significantly less evidence of inflammation as measured by various markers in their blood and lower counts of white blood cells than the placebo group an indication of overall better immune system health these effects matter said dr johannes scherr lead author of the study because if a marathon runner s body is less sore and inflamed after a race and he doesn t develop the sniffles he can recover and return to training more quickly than he otherwise might have been able to it can be speculated that the training frequency could be higher with shorter breaks after vigorous training sessions in those drinking beer he wrote in an e mail response just how nonalcoholic beer eases the ravages of strenuous marathon training and racing is still being investigated but said dr scherr it almost certainly involves the beverage s rich bouquet of polyphenols chemical substances found in many plants that among other things suppress viral replication and influence the innate immune system positively all beneficial for fighting off a cold alcoholic beer happens to be drenched in polyphenols too even more than nonalcoholic beer dr scherr said but has the signal disadvantage of being alcoholic we do not know whether the side effects of alcoholic beer would cancel out the positive effects caused by the polyphenols he wrote furthermore it is not possible to drink one to one and a half liters of alcoholic beer per day especially not during strenuous training we all knew that right of course other substances containing polyphenols have shown early promise and then underperformed in follow up studies quercetin for instance a polyphenol derived principally from apple skins was widely touted by endurance athletes several years ago after studies found that large doses allowed untrained lab mice to run for far longer than untreated animals but the supplement has largely failed to show benefits in human athletes an analysis of human studies of the supplement presented at the american college of sports medicine annual meeting in june concluded that quercetin supplementation is very unlikely to provide an endurance performance advantage but the beer experiment did not begin by looking at mice it began with human marathoners completing a punishing unsimulated race and showed demonstrable benefits in terms of minimizing postrace damage all of which is good news as the fall marathon season approaches asked if he would recommend that serious marathon runners add nonalcoholic beer to their diets dr scherr said when i look at the results of our study i would have to answer yes it s possible to get large amounts of polyphenols from other foods he added like those training table staples chokeberries and mangosteens as well as pomegranates and grapes but with these foods you do not consume the minerals fluid and carbohydrates he said so nonalcoholic beer seems to be optimal for everything perhaps apart from your well deserved celebratory carouse after the race for that at least the beer can be full potency,1

by steven reinberg healthday reporter wednesday aug healthday news people who have narrowed carotid arteries in the neck and show no symptoms may be at risk for stroke and not know it but a simple ultrasound test can identify the problem a new study suggests this condition known as asymptomatic carotid stenosis is caused by plaque build up in the arteries that carry blood from the heart to the brain this can cause less blood to reach the brain and in rare cases may also trigger a stroke if plaque breaks off and becomes lodged in the small vessels in the brain only a small minority of patients with carotid stenosis will suffer a stroke said lead researcher dr raffi topakian from the academic teaching hospital wagner jauregg in linz austria the problem is identifying the patients at the highest risk for stroke he said most patients with carotid stenosis can be managed with medications such as cholesterol lowering drugs blood pressure lowering drugs and blood thinners such as aspirin he added but those at highest risk may need a surgical procedure called an endarterectomy which clears the carotid arteries of plaque we found with two ultrasound methods we could differentiate the patients who are at very low risk of suffering a stroke lower than percent per year from patients at high risk of stroke higher than percent per year topakian said the patients who are at high risk are candidates for surgery he said endarterectomy is not recommended for most people with carotid stenosis since the problem can be managed with drugs and there are risks including stroke with the procedure topakian said those who would benefit from the ultrasound test are people with known carotid stenosis who are fit for surgery topakian said if they are too sick or frail for surgery it makes no sense to do the ultrasound he said in addition people at high risk for stroke are also candidates for ultrasound topakian said this would include people with high cholesterol high blood pressure or heart disease he said this test could be a good tool to identify the right patients for surgery topakian said of course anyone with symptomatic carotid stenosis is a candidate for immediate surgery topakian said warning signs include transient ischemic attacks tias or mini strokes which cause no permanent damage but are often followed by a stroke within a few days the report was published in the aug online edition of neurology for the study a research team led by topakian followed people with asymptomatic carotid stenosis for two years each participant had an ultrasound to see if there were signs that a stroke might occur these included tiny blood clots which pass into the brain and a type of plaque called echolucent plaque which is fattier than other plaque and linked with an increased risk for stroke among those in the study percent had the fattier than normal plaque percent had signs of blood clots and percent had both the fattier plaque and blood clots the researchers found in addition over the two years of the study people had tias moreover people with the fattier plaque were more than six times more likely to have a stroke than those people without the plaque and those with the fattier plaque and clots had a risk that was times higher topakian s team found nonetheless some experts said that research suggests that patients with no symptoms are better off without the surgery dr lars marquardt a professor of surgery at the university of erlangen nuremberg in germany and co author of an accompanying journal editorial said surgery for people with asymptomatic carotid steno sis is done too frequently marquardt noted that the risks associated with the surgery are a lot higher than leaving the stenosis as it is and starting aggressive medical treatment patients with symptomatic carotid stenosis don t get the surgical procedure early enough and patients with asymptomatic carotid stenosis have too many surgical interventions marquardt said when treating asymptomatic carotid stenosis marquardt doesn t think the case has been made for distinguishing between high and low risk patients right now the work done by topakian s group is still experimental he said another expert dr larry b goldstein director of the duke university stroke center said that what remains uncertain is whether surgical intervention would result in an overall improvement in stroke free survival it is also unclear how optimal medical management lifestyle changes in addition to anti platelet medication and statins would affect overall stroke and cardiovascular risk and stroke free survival he said both the u s preventive services task force and the american heart association currently recommend against general population screening for asymptomatic carotid artery stenosis goldstein noted more information for more information on stroke visit the u s national library of medicine,1
cnn most heart attacks strike with no warning but doctors now have a clearer picture than ever before of who is most likely to have one says dr arthur agatston a miami cardiologist and author of the best selling south beach diet books agatston says relatively new imaging tests give real time pictures showing whether plaque is building up in key blood vessels alerting doctor and patient to an increased risk of a potentially deadly heart attack unless you do the imaging you are really playing russian roulette with your life he said agatston invented one of the imaging tests the coronary calcium scan which looks at plaque in the arteries leading to the heart plaque in these arteries is a red flag for a potential heart attack agatston does not make any money from the coronary calcium scan the other imaging test agatston recommends is an ultrasound of the carotid artery looking at plaque in the main blood vessel leading to the brain plaque in the carotid artery is a sign of increased risk for a heart attack and stroke american heart association learn and live both tests are non invasive and outpatient although the calcium scan does expose the patient to the equivalent of several months of normal background radiation one large federally funded study found the coronary calcium score a better predictor of coronary events like a heart attack than the traditional framingham risk score which considers age cigarette smoking blood pressure total cholesterol and hdl the good cholesterol agatston thinks the coronary calcium scan should be routinely scheduled at age like a colonoscopy or earlier for people with family histories of heart disease most hospitals now offer the imaging tests some at less than for both and they are often covered by insurance cardiologists now generally use the calcium scan only for patients considered at intermediate risk for heart disease determined by traditional measures such as cholesterol blood pressure lifestyle and family history high risk patients already receive such aggressive treatment as cholesterol lowering statin medication but many doctors don t think low risk patients need to incur the expense or small dose of radiation that comes with a coronary calcium scan there is a large group in the middle called intermediate risk which may be as much as of the population said dr erin michos a cardiologist at the ciccarone center for the prevention of heart disease at johns hopkins university a good candidate for a coronary calcium scan she says would be a year old man with slightly elevated cholesterol and a father who had a heart attack do you put this year old who has this family history on a statin medication with potential expense and side effects for the next four decades of his life or do you further refine how far at risk he is she asked a calcium score would answer that question she says there s a third test agatston likes a blood test that looks at a patient s ldl or bad cholesterol ldl particles come in different sizes and patients with a lot of small particle ldl are more likely to build up plaque in their blood vessels agatston says alternately patients with large ldl particles do not tend to accumulate plaque there are a lot of little old ladies in their s with very high cholesterol who have squeaky clean vessels they have very large particles and they don t get into the vessel wall agatston says these new tests give patients a chance to make major changes in their diet and lifestyle and give doctors an opportunity to treat them with medication one of the best kept secrets in the country in medicine is the doctors who are practicing aggressive prevention are really seeing heart attacks and strokes disappear from their practices it s doable agatston says watch sanjay gupta md saturday at pm and sunday at am et for the latest from sanjay gupta md click here,0

by alan mozes healthday reporter monday aug healthday news a traditional chinese herbal treatment may reduce fever from h n swine flu influenza just as well as the prescription medication tamiflu a new study suggests for thousands of years chinese herbs have been used to treat influenza study co authors dr chen wang and dr bin cao of beijing chao yang hospital capital medical university in china said in an email the pandemic influenza gave us the opportunity to evaluate a standard chinese herb formula designed to target the flu they added cao and wang who specialize in infectious diseases and clinical microbiology said the herbal recipe known as maxingshigan yinqiaosan m y is easily accessible throughout china and much less expensive than tamiflu oseltamivir however finding the medicine in the united states is difficult if not impossible given that it contains the stimulant ephedra the united states has banned or restricted the sale of ephedra products because of concerns about possible complications such as heart attack stroke and even death related to its use as a weight loss supplement the authors discuss their findings in the aug issue of the annals of internal medicine the h n swine flu pandemic sparked influenza cases around the globe resulting in nearly deaths the authors said per world health organization who recommendations in most instances tamiflu was the treatment of choice where it was available however it is often out of reach in less developed parts of the world such as rural china where traditional herbal medicines are a likely default treatment the m y flu preparation is composed of herbs ephedrae zhimu qinghao shigao yinhua huangqin chaoxingren lianqiao bohe zhebeimu niubangzi and gancao to compare the relative effectiveness of m y and tamiflu in treating h n influenza the authors focused on previously healthy patients who were diagnosed with a very mild form of the illness the men and women were relatively young with an average age of they were being treated in different medical facilities across four chinese provinces during the height of the pandemic between july and november of to prevent spreading the flu not because their symptoms were severe within hours of the onset of symptoms the patients were assigned to one of four five day treatment groups one group was given milligrams of tamiflu twice a day in capsule form a second group received milliliters of m y four times a day in liquid form a third group took the same dosages of tamiflu and m y together and a fourth group received no treatment all of the herbs were screened for quality and the m y mixture was deemed to meet chinese safety standards the results both m y and tamiflu were effective at eliminating fever whether administered on their own or in combination all three approaches helped to resolve fever sooner than no intervention whatsoever the authors said noting it appeared that fever dissipated fastest when m y and tamiflu were given together however none of the treatment methods appeared to be superior in terms of overall viral control and side effects were minimal in all cases even though the ephedra containing herbal is not readily available in the united states the m y herbal formula is available in many countries besides china including korea japan india and germany the study authors noted duffy mackay vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs at the council for responsible nutrition which represents the dietary supplement industry believes that fears over ephedra s use as a weight control agent have overlooked its more traditional and much safer role as a medicine against lung inflammation mackay said that in china traditional medicine is seamlessly integrated into everyday medical practice here in the u s we do things differently he said we have our prescription drugs on the one hand and then we have dietary supplements on the other but mackay continued it should also be understood that these two treatments actually work very differently tamiflu works to stop viral replication but the herbal formula is working on symptoms to help people become more comfortable and those are two very different goals he noted so our advice mackay added is that because h n can be very serious it s very important to see your doctor and once you re under the care of your licensed physician there s certainly a lot of things in the world of botanicals that might help more information for more on the flu and traditional medicine visit the u s national center for complementary and alternative medicine,1
of course hologic has done some selling of its own the firm which markets itself as the women s health company makes other products including a d digital mammography machine a test that assesses risk of preterm labor gynecological products including adiana a permanent contraception technique and widely used equipment that measures bone density but d mammography could become its flagship because for the moment it owns the entire market although other companies including powerhouse ge are developing their own d machines hologic is the only one with fda approval thus far of course given the sluggish economy and the continuing state of uncertainty around american health care persuading hospitals to upgrade may be challenging so perhaps it s not surprising that the company s powerpoint presentation to the fda included the unsubtle phrase huge breakthrough or that the first american patient to undergo d mammography laura lang a polished year old boston marketing executive and breast cancer survivor did so in front of a cbs camera crew last february indeed they do they re catching on like well it s not a slow burn the device earned food and drug administration approval on february and for a short time it was available only at mgh now it is available in at least nine states three of which have multiple sites and most of the several dozen hospitals around the united states that assisted with clinical trials are planning to buy systems too the images aren t the only selling point the early data are compelling as well in studies presented to the fda radiologists reported a percent improvement in their ability to distinguish cancerous from noncancerous cases when they used the new system if that sounds unimpressive consider that million women are screened each year any significant reduction in callbacks for additional testing would mean hundreds of thousands of women would be spared painful and expensive follow up dr elizabeth rafferty is trying not to lapse into rhapsodic cliches i don t want to call it a magic bullet because that would oversell she says it s not a panacea then five minutes later i don t want to say it s catching on like wildfire after a few minutes more though rafferty can t help herself she lets her enthusiasm loose people have been waiting for it for a long time she says it s a step but it s a step by a person who has a stride of feet it is a d mammography machine the selenia dimensions system one of which sits in the breast imaging clinic at massachusetts general hospital that rafferty a radiologist runs the machine which is made by the bedford company hologic and developed partly at mgh under rafferty s supervision produces images that are so vivid and clear they seem to speak out loud hey right here this is a tumor if you look at enough of them you may become convinced that you don t need medical training to spot a case of breast cancer or distinguish a false positive on a mammogram from a true one the distinction seems that clear if you can tell the difference as a non radiologist imagine how a radiologist feels says rafferty the images sort of sell themselves much of the criticism focused on the data the task force had used to make its decision which consisted largely of the results from prospective randomized clinical trials conducted in the united states trials like this are the gold standard of medical evidence they are also expensive and time consuming and thus hard to come by the most recent such trial looking at mammography and mortality in the united states was published in the s a lot of the people on the task force are my friends and i have tremendous respect for them but this was a big point where we differed says brawley the standard type of mammography that s used all over the country today may very well be better than what was used in that trial so the outcomes may be better too the studies the task force had chosen to examine showed that screening beginning at age had little impact on mortality while at the same time generating a significant number of false positives those data were complete and comprehensive but says brawley they were outdated the task force wasn t expecting a firestorm that however was what it got breast cancer advocacy groups mutinied saying the guidelines would cause significant numbers of women to go undiagnosed for years some of them fatally politicians started giving scary speeches about rationing health care many radiologists including the mgh department as a whole rejected the new guidelines daniel kopans a world leader in breast imaging he wrote the textbook of that name and a radiologist at mgh now says that the panel didn t understand mammography screening furthermore he adds the new guidelines had no biological or scientific reason behind them the last time someone tried to improve the way american women are screened for breast cancer it turned into a national debacle in november the us preventive services task force a government backed group of doctors charged with making recommendations that often influence what insurers will pay for updated its guidelines for mammography previously it had advised women to begin annual or biannual screening at the new guidelines pushed that age to emphasizing that starting earlier should be an individual choice debates about mammography are often so emotionally charged that this type of nuance goes missing i think some of our rhetoric medicine s in general and also that of advocates has made people think that every metastatic breast cancer is a failure of the woman to get a mammogram or of a doctor to read a mammogram correctly says otis brawley chief medical officer of the american cancer society and a professor at emory university s school of medicine in atlanta in reality yes mammography does save lives but it is far from perfect it s not as good as many people think it is so if the new d mammography isn t perfect just how good is it but the company and the rest of us should be careful not to overhype d mammography as rafferty says it s not a panacea the technology does come with costs financial and medical a fully equipped d machine runs on average not including the annual service fee hologic charges for maintenance and even hospitals that already own an upgradeable d system made by hologic have to pay about to get it adapted for d use there are also costs in the sense of risks women who get a combo d and d mammogram the protocol that confers the most dramatic jump in benefits are exposed to twice as much x ray radiation as the norm albeit still an amount that s under the fda s permitted limit and no one yet knows if the new technique will actually save lives is hologic s d mammography machine likely to fare better there are reasons to think it will unlike mri which requires an injection with contrast dye and an hour in the imaging machine it isn t an ordeal or at least it s no worse than a conventional mammogram yes you still have to endure the dreaded clamp and it seems to be more effective than its most similar precursor the d digital technique early data from rafferty s trial showed that the same group of women who did benefit from d digital benefited even more dramatically from d it s worth noting that this is not a small group of people fifty percent of women are in what the american cancer society considers the intermediate zone of risk which overlaps considerably with the group that saw some benefit in dmist perhaps more important even the women who didn t see any improvement in accuracy with d get a small boost with d over film and d seems to be both more sensitive and more specific improvement in one area doesn t have to come at the cost of the other but when the definitive trial of d digital techniques called dmist was published in tracking nearly patients it didn t provide the answers that advocates had been expecting digital mammography did seem to perform more accurately than film in women who were younger than women who were pre or perimenopausal and women with dense breast tissue but when all women were considered as a group that benefit disappeared on the whole it turned out digital just didn t live up to the way it had been sold when d digital mammography was introduced in doctors hoped it would vault over those problems well most of them the cost concern was still present digital mammography machines were five times as expensive as film ones the marketing materials suggested it already had an ad for ge s d digital system that ran during the summer olympics called it a major new breakthrough in the fight against breast cancer digital technology the thinking went would show nuances that film never could because it could render literally many more shades of gray the problem however was that each time they introduced a new imaging tool for breast cancer they found that they could not advance on one front without taking a step backward on the other first there was ultrasound says rafferty we did find more cancers but we also found so many false positives that it was untenable then there was mri which had the same problem and it was times more expensive than mammography rafferty had already been running trials of d mammography for two years when the task force s guidelines came out she understood its concern about false positives she was trying to address it herself albeit in a very different way in fact technology developers had been trying in various ways for years to increase mammography s sensitivity its ability to flag possible cases of cancer while also increasing its specificity its ability to filter out the false positives there s an intuitive argument for why d mammography might be more accurate the technique works a little like a ct scan does it takes pictures of the breast at slightly different angles then fuses them into a single synthesized image if breast cancers were spherical in shape they d look basically the same in all images or for that matter on a conventional d picture but they re very rarely shaped that way in reality in the breast in particular cancer cells tend to creep out single file along the architecture of the body says rafferty and that makes some of them especially hard to see on a d mammogram they look like distortions not blobs there s another thing about cancer that is much clearer on a d mammogram spicules or thin spidery tentacles emerging from the center of a tumor d images when taken from the wrong angle are often too fuzzy to show them in d however the spicules are visible in high resolution and seeing them is critical since they are a hallmark of malignancy to rafferty the existing data are persuasive enough i own no stock in hologic i have no financial ties to them and i was skeptical of this idea at first you think to yourself it is that simple that elegant she says but this really does address the fundamental flaw of mammography i want every woman to have access to this technology i got my sisters down here when it was approved i was like you re all going to get this because in my heart i know it s better andy smith hologic s vice president of imaging science is similarly hopeful it s expected to improve the cancer detection rate it is going to reduce the recall rate he says referring to suspicious findings that require women to return for follow up tests some of which turn out to be false alarms and we will have more numbers on that within one to two years this last part at least is very likely true mammography is heavily regulated and clinics are required to send their recall statistics the number of women they call back for second looks to the federal government the data on whether d will save more lives than d may not be known immediately but they will exist however the most meaningful data the numbers that would show whether d mammography saves women s lives won t be available for decades only a prospective randomized trial with mortality as its endpoint can say for sure and that s how long it takes to conduct one smith knows that that s the reality we are expecting a reduction in morbidity and mortality but we won t know that for a long time he says you know this technology has only been approved for two months by the time such data do come out mammography will surely have changed again there are already efforts to augment it with contrast dyes to develop a complementary tool called a gamma camera and to augment imperfect human judgment by refining computer programs that can spot tumors as well as a radiologist might what this means is that the next time the us preventive services task force or anyone else wants to take a hard look at mammography the data it has will once again be outdated it s inevitable three d mammography may very well be more accurate than d it may see more cancers and fewer impostors but whether it s truly a huge breakthrough by the metric that matters most is a question that can t currently be answered and that may be irrelevant by the time it can be rafferty may know in her heart that d is better but right now at least that s the only way she truly can mary carmichael is a member of the globe staff send comments to copyright globe newspaper company,1

silicone breast implants safe with caveats enlarge this image toggle caption donna mcwilliam ap donna mcwilliam ap silicone breast implants were pulled off the market in amid concerns that leaks from the implants could lead to cancer or autoimmune disease five years ago revamped products returned to the market but now the food and drug administration has evaluated the safety of the second generation of silicone implants and the results are mixed an fda report released in late june says silicone implants are generally safe but complications from implants are frequent things like hardening of the skin around the implant ruptured wrinkled or lopsided implants scarring pain and infection as many as half of patients will need to have additional surgeries or have the implants removed in the first decade it also turns out that the longer a woman has the implants the more likely she is to experience these complications ruptured implants can require surgery take kate marion she had silicone implants for breast augmentation in her late s just shy of two decades later she noticed something unusual when i was crossing my left arm across my body for instance to put lotion on my right arm i would make a little noise from my armpit the way little boys do when they stick their hand in their armpit and pump their arm up and down marion says a little tooty noise an mri showed both her implants had burst her doctor immediately recommended removing them which she did marion hasn t suffered any apparent harm from her ruptured implants and she even confesses to having an occasional twinge of regret that she didn t have them replaced when she had the old ones removed but ultimately she decided she didn t want to go through more surgery there is a huge deficiency of long term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in the more problems occur well how long would these next ones last i would be in my s when i had to do this again and who wants to have surgery unnecessarily when you are something says marion although the long term effects of silicone in the body are still uncertain many plastic surgeons don t see the leaking of modern implants as a health concern the actual silicone that s within the implants is inert so if the silicone gel leaks it doesn t travel through the body it doesn t cause systemic problems so the mri is really detecting a cosmetic concern says new york city plastic surgeon matthew schulman oily silicone versus gel but there have been more serious outcomes annette knecht got silicone implants in following a double mastectomy for years afterward she felt ill suffered multiple bouts of pneumonia had trouble breathing and pain in her chest doctors reassured her it wasn t her implants we had a ct scan done and it showed ok everything looked fine so we didn t worry about it says knecht but no one ever told her to get an mri something the fda now recommends that women with silicone implants get every few years as it turned out knecht s implants had leaked a biopsy found silicone in her lymph nodes and in her lungs she is currently disabled and awaiting a lung transplant all she says for vanity we re about four generations removed from those implants says schulman the plastic surgeon he explains that implants have undergone big changes since the early s when knecht received hers back then they contained a runny liquid silicone the silicone implants of today are what we call a cohesive gel it s essentially like a jelly so the jelly may ooze a little bit but it will not run out like an oil says schulman sid wolf of the nonprofit watchdog group public citizen is among critics who point out that the data in the fda report sample just a fraction of the nearly women who receive breast implants each year moreover that data are limited to just the last two or three years not enough wolf says to make any real claims about the long term safety of the implants there is a huge deficiency of long term data at a time when we know that the longer these devices are in the more problems occur says wolf thousands still choosing silicone still there are plenty of satisfied customers among the nearly women who receive breast implants each year not only have the number of women choosing breast implants for augmentation risen by nearly percent in the last decade schulman says that in his practice percent of them are choosing silicone over saline what s more he says few of them follow the recommendations to get routine mris to screen for leaks schulman says that the rates of complications for silicone implants are roughly the same as for saline though he feels these complications can be minimized by choosing an experienced surgeon still he warns his patients that no procedure is without risks and additional surgeries are a very real possibility your young breast implants don t last forever says schulman they may leak they may rupture you may decide you want a different size so you have to at least expect that sometime in your life you are going to need a reoperation and if you are percent against having another surgery related to these implants then it s something you should reconsider,1

back to previous page new laser treatment takes aim at toenail fungus by rachel saslow for people with toenail fungus there is no good time to wear sandals not even at the beach in july toenail fungus causes nails to become thick yellow and brittle in a way that looks pretty ugly and can be painful sufferers can spend years and hundreds of dollars trying to clear the infection with drugs topical treatments and home remedies sometimes to no avail it tends to be a cosmetic issue for the younger set and a pain issue for older folks the problem is huge it is bigger than you can imagine says washington podiatrist stephen j kominsky i would say percent of the patients who come into my office have fungal infections on their toenails there may be hope podiatrists have begun using a laser treatment that combats the infection or wastes their patients money because it doesn t work depending on whom you ask the treatment in which the podiatrist aims a laser beam at the patient s toenails to kill the organisms that cause the fungus costs about and is not covered by insurance because it is considered an aesthetic procedure the nails aren t immediately clear after the treatment which takes up to an hour the patient must wait for the fungus free nails to grow out last year the food and drug administration cleared the first laser pinpointe for temporary increase of clear nail in patients with onychomycosis the medical term for a fungal infection of the nail the fda cleared a second one genesisplus in april practitioners have been using other lasers on toenail fungus since about no side effects kominsky has treated to patients with the pinpointe laser compared with oral medication he says the odds of success are better with the laser plus there s no side effects the most common oral treatment lamisil works for about two out of three patients according to lamisil s fda approved prescribing information but it has been associated with rare cases of serious liver problems other potential side effects include diarrhea headache rashes and changes in taste according to lamisil s manufacturer novartis the relapse rate is percent one year after completing treatment in one small study about laser treatment for toenail fungus which appeared last year in the journal of the american podiatric medical association eligible toes ten mild seven moderate and nine severe were treated with a laser produced by nomir medical technologies which is still seeking fda approval after six months percent of the toenails had improved i never use the term cured with toenail fungus kominsky says with a cure people think there s no chance for a recurrence in this case there is a chance even john strisower the founder of pinpointe usa says patients should expect at least a minimal reinfection within five years after laser treatment routes of infection research done by pinpointe which is based in chico calif identified more than organisms including fungi yeast mold and bacteria that work together to cause toenail fungus there s no one route of infection but sources include pedicures and locker room showers fungi love moist dark environments such as wet shoes kominsky says so people such as lifeguards landscapers and fishermen are particularly susceptible shoes are the reason why toenail fungus is much more common than fingernail fungus which can also occur the elderly are more likely to have toenail fungus than younger people because they have had more years to be exposed to the infection and their immune systems can t always fight it off according to washington podiatrist lee firestone he estimates that about half of people over have toenail fungus last year americans spent million on prescription and over the counter treatments for toenail fungus according to ims health a health care information company firestone typically recommends oral medication for patients with toenail fungus i think the laser can improve the appearance of the nail but it s only temporary and it needs to be used again and again to maintain that improvement says firestone who doesn t use the lasers in his practice i ve had patients come in who have had laser procedures and not seen long term success vinegar won t work firestone also says that over the counter antifungal nail creams and ointments rarely work because they can t penetrate the nail root home remedies such as tea tree oil bleach and vinegar also don t work he says yet even a superficial improvement would be an improvement for many richard a retiree in fairfax who did not want his full name associated with toenail fungus got a laser treatment on all toes in april and he says his nails were fully cleared of the yellowed thickened look after a year to prevent reinfection he has

got low back pain massage therapy may rub it out enlarge this image toggle caption group health research institute group health research institute low back pain is second only to cold symptoms when it comes to complaints that send people to the doctor sooner or later back pain seems to get most of us summary for patients read a summary of the findings and their implications from the annals of internal medicine a comparison of massage therapy and usual medical care for chronic low back pain now a study in the july issue of the annals of internal medicine shows that massage is an effective treatment for lower back pain in some cases researchers report the benefits of massage lasted for six months or longer researchers headed by epidemiologist daniel cherkin a senior investigator at group health research institute in seattle enrolled people with chronic low back pain and no identifiable reason for the pain study participants were randomly assigned to one of three treatments one group received full body relaxation massage a second received targeted deep tissue massage the third group got the usual care medication and physical therapy in relaxation massage often referred to as swedish massage a variety of maneuvers are used to promote a feeling of relaxation throughout the body and muscles structural massage commonly referred to as deep tissue massage targets specific pain related tissues ligaments and joints after weeks the results were dramatic nearly two thirds of the patients who received either type of weekly massage said their back pain was significantly improved or gone altogether only about one third of patients receiving the usual care experienced similar relief we found that both types of massage were equally effective in helping people improve their function and diminish their symptoms cherkin says he says massage relieved the pain for six months or more prior studies of massage for back pain had tested only structural forms of massage not relaxation massage but relaxation massage is more widely available and it s often less costly i m so very lucky peggy o brien murphy was among the study participants in her late s a retired state employee o brien murphy tried just about everything to get rid of the pain in her lower back the massage therapy finally seemed to do the trick i m so very lucky she says prior to the study o brien murphy says she had found herself increasingly debilitated by back pain at one point she says she could hardly get out of a chair it was really bad she says in fact i was pulling myself up the stairs by the banister it was difficult getting into the car and she could no longer walk the hills where she lives for an active person this was devastating so when she came upon an ad in her hmo s newsletter group health cooperative in seattle she jumped at the chance to take part in the massage study after just two or three sessions with massage therapist loretta lanz o brien murphy said she felt better after each session she walked around the block standing straighter and walking further each time by the end she felt back to normal with a spring to my walk and some energy in it for o brien murphy the massage therapy experience has been life changing she has traveled to china where she walked all over without problems and she s already planning her next trips no one knows exactly how massage works to relieve pain says dr richard deyo of oregon health sciences university who also took part in the study it may be that it helps with relaxation of muscles that are tense deyo says but it may also be there are simply more generalized effects of relaxation in the caring and attention and someone laying hands on that may all be important researchers say future studies should look more closely at the benefits of massage and focus on cost benefit analysis as for o brien murphy she remains free of back pain but not without some effort on her part other studies have shown that building strong and flexible muscles can help prevent back pain o brien murphy never exercised before but now she does weight training muscle stretches and aerobic exercise activities all shown to help prevent recurrence of lower back pain,1
chicago reuters the longest running breast cancer screening study ever conducted has shown that regular mammograms prevent deaths from breast cancer and the number of lives saved increases over time an international research team said on tuesday a doctor exams mammograms a special type of x ray of the breasts which is used to detect tumours as part of a regular cancer prevention medical check up at a clinic in nice south eastern france january reuters eric gaillard the study of women in two communities in sweden showed percent fewer women in the screening group died of breast cancer and that this effect persisted year after year now years after the study began the researchers found that the number of women saved from breast cancer goes up with each year of screening we ve found that the longer we look the more lives are saved professor stephen duffy of queen mary university of london whose study was published in the journal radiology said in a statement dr stamatia destounis a radiologist at elizabeth wende breast care in rochester new york who was not involved in the study said radiologists have been quoting results of the swedish study for years and the new findings show breast cancer screening is even more of a benefit than we understood she said sweeping changes in the u s screening guidelines two years ago that scaled back recommendations on breast cancer screening caused a lot of confusion among doctors and patients about the benefits of mammograms we ve had to do a lot of education of the patients and their doctors this will help for that destounis said in the study women were divided into two groups one that received an invitation to have breast cancer screening and another that received usual care the screening phase of the trial lasted about seven years women between and were screened every two years and women to were screened roughly every three years our results indicate that in women screened for years three breast cancer deaths would be prevented duffy said adding that most of the deaths prevented would have occurred more than a decade after the screening had started this indicates that the long term benefits of screening in terms of deaths prevented are more than double those often quoted for short term follow up the new data adds to evidence on the long term benefits of regular mammography screening screening controversy new breast screening recommendations issued in by the u s preventive services task force an influential advisory group recommended against routine mammograms for women in their s and said women in their s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year the guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age eliciting protests from breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation for fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer the changes were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps but the latest results from the swedish study show the rate of false positive results was low we saw the actual number of overdiagnosed cases was really very small less than percent of the total robert smith director of cancer screening at the american cancer society and one of the study s authors said in a telephone interview many groups including the american cancer society have stuck by their long standing recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age stressing that the breast x rays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early when they are most easily treated i think for anybody who was beginning to have their faith shaken in the value of mammography these data show mammography is quite valuable as a public health approach to reducing deaths from breast cancer smith said duffy said he thinks screening women to every months and screening women and older every two years would be a reasonable schedule he said the new findings do not speak to the frequency of screening issue but they do make clear that screening works everyone must make up their own mind but certainly from combined results from all the screening trials mammography in women aged does reduce deaths from breast cancer he said breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among u s women after lung cancer it kills people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to million people around the world,1

autism spectrum disorders marked by impaired language repetitive behaviors and social difficulties now affect up to one in children according to the cdc the research needs to be duplicated hertz picciotto tells webmd still she says the finding points to a gene environment interaction that may possibly help explain some cases of autism taking prenatal vitamins was found even more protective for mothers and children who had a high risk genetic makeup it appears that women who reported taking prenatal vitamins starting three months prior to conception and through the first month after conception seem to have a reduced chance their child will develop autism says study researcher irva hertz picciotto phd professor of epidemiology and environmental health at the mind institute and department of public health university of california davis june taking prenatal vitamins may reduce the risk of having a child with autism new research shows prenatal vitamins and autism risk the researchers looked at three groups of children all aged to all were enrolled in the charge study childhood autism risks from genetics and environment from to the groups included children with autism with autism spectrum disorder children with typical development mothers reported their use of prenatal vitamins or other supplements before during and after pregnancy the researchers collected blood from all family members to evaluate their genetic makeup they focused on genes known to play a role in folate metabolism these genes include mthfr and comt as well as others folate and other b vitamins are crucial to brain development overall hertz picciotto says for the women who didn t take prenatal vitamins there was about a higher risk of having a child with autism the risk rose if the mothers or the children had a high risk gene form the mothers with the high risk form of mthfr had a times higher chance of a child developing autism she says than mothers without this high risk form who did take the prenatal vitamins children who had the high risk comt gene form were seven times as likely to have autism as children without it whose mothers did take the vitamins overall it does look like there are at least a couple of genes here either the mother s genotype or the child s genotype that show this interaction magnifying the size of the effect from not taking the vitamins hertz picciotto says exactly why the prenatal vitamins may protect against autism is not clear she says it may be that the vitamins contribute to high levels of folate,1
egg freezing puts the biological clock on hold enlarge this image toggle caption marisa penaloza npr marisa penaloza npr this story is part of an occasional series as more women postpone motherhood into their s even s they re hitting that age old constraint the biological clock now technology is dangling the possibility that women can stop that clock at least for a while in a manhattan office building on a recent evening two dozen women all in their s and s sit in folding chairs balancing cellphones and glasses of wine they re gathered for a seminar called take control of your fertility dr alan copperman of reproductive medicine associates of new york wastes no time laying out this harsh reality by the time a woman hits her s percent of her eggs are abnormal the chances of a typical year old getting pregnant in any given month ten percent unless that is she gets pregnant with her younger eggs eggs she had frozen years before copperman explains the procedure introduces someone who has gone through it and takes a flurry of questions afterward women crowd a counter to set up appointments with copperman s clinic which offers egg freezing sally montgomery is among the youngest here and the most upbeat her mom had trouble conceiving so she wants to be proactive i m your typical new yorker she says i m single i m bouncing around and i d like the opportunity to have a family so i just figured why not i don t think it s a guarantee but it s a nice insurance policy and i think it takes some of the pressure off others though slip out quietly one year old says she wishes she d learned about egg freezing earlier esther montoro a year old photographer looks a little stunned i think it s fantastic she says but i think it s so incredibly expensive the whole process a week of hormones plus the procedure to collect the eggs runs to and because it takes to eggs for a reasonable shot at success some may need to do this several times plus there are annual storage fees then when you re ready to use your eggs you ll need in vitro fertilization another pricey procedure all told costs can easily exceed money montoro doesn t have read more istockphoto com i guess there s a big assumption that most women that need to do this are career successful rich women she says and i m not technological advances in his office later copperman empathizes and says he hopes the procedure eventually becomes easier and cheaper still he says freezing eggs offers many women the biggest game changer since the birth control pill years ago women began to have reproductive choices he says they got to decide when not to get pregnant this technology has the potential to help women decide when they can get pregnant clinics in the u s have long frozen fertilized eggs or embryos but eggs alone are more delicate and prone to damage over the years egg freezing has been offered mainly to cancer patients facing radiation but success rates were pretty dismal of late though the technology has exploded thanks to scientific leaps including a flash freeze method called vitrification in copperman s lab you can hear the sizzle as a tiny tube is plunged into liquid nitrogen snap freeze snap thaw he says and what s really impressive is that when it comes out it comes out looking just like it went in ironically much of this research was pioneered in italy and spain where catholic influence discouraged the creation of too many embryos leaving fertility researchers with unused eggs instead with the better survival rate from vitrification and other new freezing methods more and more clinics are now offering what they call fertility preservation meanwhile the early adopters are starting to come back and use their eggs first wave of babies in a new york high rise month old camden squeals in delight as she bounces in her walker she s here thanks to eggs her mom froze several years ago my best friend and i made a pact together that at age if we were both still single we were going to have a child on our own says robyn ross when that time came ross decided she wasn t ready for single motherhood instead she froze eggs within a year she fell in love and soon got married her husband mark cohen says he wasn t at all put off by the fact that his new love had her eggs in the freezer as it turned out his sperm was weakened by earlier cancer treatment so conceiving their baby in a lab was the perfect solution and this is our miracle baby cohen says planting a kiss on camden we are one little happy family ross has already evangelized to her younger sister i made her promise me that if she s still single by the age of she would freeze her eggs she says the younger the better now before you run out to a fertility clinic there is a big note of caution the society for assisted reproductive technology which sets industry guidelines still considers egg freezing experimental if the question were just does egg freezing and thawing work to achieve a pregnancy i think we re close says dr eric widra a member of the society s executive council but only to babies in the world have been born using frozen eggs so far they re fine no abnormalities still widra would like a larger scale longer term track record it s not clear when or if a big scale study might happen but widra says women need to understand that success rates will never be percent it s an insurance policy that you may or may not actually ever need he says and it s an insurance policy that if you do need may not pay out and yet even widra agrees that egg freezing has appeal if it can help avoid the anguish of infertility at shady grove fertility the washington d c clinic where he practices he offers it to his own patients the challenge of setting an age limit it s quite a concept put your eggs in deep freeze and disconnect from that nagging biological clock but until when how old is too old to use your younger eggs there should be guidelines i think that are more clearly defined says dr geoffrey sher who heads the sher institutes for reproductive medicine and is based in las vegas he says many clinics suggest a cutoff of the average age of menopause after that pregnancy can be riskier and the large age gap raises complicated social issues but the limit is tricky to impose sher remembers one couple who wanted to use donor eggs to conceive the husband was his wife sher hesitated and she said that s discriminatory if my husband was my age and i was his age you wouldn t hesitate and she had a point sher says the woman was healthy and the uterus doesn t decline like eggs do in some cases it can actually be coaxed back into working order sher s ethics board said ok and she went ahead and had a baby at years of age without any problems whatsoever sher says i get a postcard from them at christmas every year the bigger challenge sher and others say is reaching out to younger women getting them to take action before it s too late they envision a time when society considers freezing eggs an act not of desperation but of empowerment this story was produced for broadcast by marisa penaloza,1

april gastric bypass weight loss surgery often improves type diabetes long before patients lose much weight now a new study from duke university medical center and columbia university may help explain why when researchers compared patients who had gastric bypass surgery to those who lost the same amount of weight by dieting they found that the surgery patients had lower levels of amino acids that have been linked to insulin resistance the study was small including just patients who had the surgery and patients who followed severely calorie restricted diets and the patients in both groups had lost just a fraction of the weight they needed to lose at the time of the analysis but researchers say the preliminary findings could one day lead to diabetes treatments certainly weight loss by any means improves type diabetes but there is something else going on with gastric bypass surgery study researcher blandine laferrere md of columbia university s st luke s and roosevelt hospital center tells webmd surgery puts the diabetes into remission most of the research has focused on changes in gut hormones but we have shown that a decline in specific circulating amino acids also occurs,1

en español by maureen salamon healthday reporter thursday april healthday news for men who believe size matters and that their penises don t measure up success can be found in certain non surgical penile lengthening treatments a new study analysis by italian researchers contends concerned that patients were seeking out unproven and potentially dangerous ways of lengthening the penis the researchers examined the medical literature to see whether popular non surgical methods had any scientific basis in a review of five evidence based surgical studies of men and six non surgical studies of men published between and the researchers found that penile extenders which stretch the organ over a period of months through traction were the most effective among non invasive methods but one expert cautioned that men are playing with fire if they tinker with their penis size simply for vanity s sake dr elizabeth kavaler a urologist at lenox hill hospital in new york city said functional issues resulting from conditions such as birth defects or prostate cancer surgery may warrant penile surgery but such cases are unusual it s a very fragile organ to begin with kavaler said and if you start to do all these things to it you can disfigure it they should leave it alone study co author dr paolo gontero said urologists are constantly approached by men concerned about their penis size despite the fact that the majority are average with a flaccid length of to inches however most men complaining of inadequate penile size do have associated sexual problems even if their penile dimensions fall within the normal range so called dysmorphophobic penis said gontero an associate professor of urology at the university of turin no study has however specifically addressed the extent and type of sexual bother in this patient category dysmorphophobia is a condition consisting of an imaginary flaw in the physical appearance the study noted writing in the april issue of the british journal of urology international gontero and his colleagues found that penile extenders work better than techniques such as vacuum devices exercises and botox injections and that psychological satisfaction is equally as important as any physical changes a review of surgical techniques showed they increased phallus size an average of about a half inch to inch but gontero cautioned that the safest surgery which cuts the suspensory ligament of the penis to lengthen it often yields poor results on the contrary more complex lengthening procedures are to be considered experimental and potentially dangerous he said all procedures aimed to increase the penile girth should be considered unsafe leading to potentially poor cosmetic and functional results gontero added i have come across such cases that i had to re operate in order to remove additive substances injected around the penis the men studied ranged in age from to and were followed between three and months more than of them used penile extenders with six experiencing minor problems such as bruising pain and itching these devices yielded average flaccid length increases of between inches and inch gontero said and men achieving better results noted their satisfaction application of progressive and constant traction forces is a very old fashioned technique used by the ancestors and currently by some tribal populations to elongate the penis or the neck he said gontero noted that cognitive behavioral therapy might help build confidence in some men long term vacuum treatments did not appear effective producing no significant physical changes after six months gontero said but did provide a degree of psychological satisfaction he and his colleagues found no scientific evidence to support penile lengthening exercises dr e douglas whitehead director of new york phalloplasty and associate clinical professor of urology at albert einstein college of medicine in new york city said suspensory ligament surgery to increase penis length can be more effective when combined with stretching techniques the human body even bone can be stretched he said so stretching the penis when done long enough will work if anything libido and desire are even better because you look better and feel better about yourself more information for more about penis size visit psychology today,1
john jeffries a year old money manager in dover mass had hip resurfacing surgery in and is now coaching his son s basketball team and long distance cycling alex douglas a wall street software architect had both knees replaced last year at after years of sports injuries he can t wait to go kite boarding this weekend i ve been cleared to have fun he says joint replacement patients these days are younger and more active than ever before more than half of all hip replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by the fastest growing group is patients to according to the american academy of orthopaedic surgery many active middle agers are wearing out their joints with marathons triathlons basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations they re also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary to accommodate them implant makers are working to build joints with longer wearing materials and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures more younger people also need joint replacement surgery due to obesity and some orthopedists refer them for weight loss surgery first to reduce complications later even the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high impact activities there is to be honest some irrational exuberance out there says daniel berry chief of orthopedic surgery at the mayo clinic in rochester minn and president of the american academy of orthopedic surgeons people may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them one big unknown how long will the replacement joints last in the past many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about or years and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery or even two a total knee replacement typically costs to a revision can be or more with a higher risk of complications john jeffries had his hip resurfaced in dominick reuter for the wall street journal steven haas chief of the knee service at the hospital for special surgery in new york city says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids take walks work or enjoy traveling to them the idea of being miserable in their s so they might not need another surgery in their s doesn t make much sense he says several studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that to are still functioning well after years advances in wear resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer for example many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer metal on metal hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients bloodstreams and cause soft tissue damage hip implants made with ceramic on ceramic components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak last year one manufacturer smith nephew won clearance from the food and drug administration to market its latest technology as a year knee based on tests mimicking years of wear still there are no long term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients we have to install them and see says robert namba an orthopedic surgeon with kaiser permanente in irvine calif the biggest variable is patients themselves as a rule the more active they are the faster their joints will wear out loosen or require revision most orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk swim and cycle as much as possible golf and doubles tennis are acceptable but jogging running jumping and singles tennis are out if your goal is a year knee you need to avoid high impact sports says john wright an orthopedic surgeon at brigham and women s hospital in boston that said some patients are determined to push the envelope and some doctors give their blessing if you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage it will last forever and you won t have any fun says thomas schmalzried an orthopedic surgeon at st vincent medical center in los angeles a former college basketball player dr schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints i know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function what i don t know what nobody knows is where the lines are for the average patient some doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery and as long as they avoid skiing moguls there s a happy medium and it s not necessarily the same for every patient says dr berry one might say i m willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me and another might not personal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether and when a patient is ready for joint replacement surgery it got to the point where i couldn t get on my motorcycle anymore says paul canter a picture framer from los angeles who had a double hip replacement at last year chris schubert was kicked by a horse when she was then suffered a near fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot mounting pain and inflammation over the next years forced her to quit recreational horseback riding interrupted her sleep and interfered with her work as a building contractor she had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with dr haas last year at age and her pain and limitations are gone i thought my path in life was set and i d just be miserable she says i never imagined my life could be this wonderful patients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort pre hab building up strength before the surgery is just as important as re hab afterward they say i was in the best shape of my life before i went in for the surgery says mr jeffries the money manager who trained twice a day for six months before his hip resurfacing surgery in and staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation i made up my mind if i was going to go through all this surgery and rehab i wanted to make these hips last as long as they possibly can says carol espel an executive of equinox fitness who damaged both hips dancing professionally and teaching fitness for years now she takes classes in cycling yoga pilates and strength training weekly no impact ever she says mark liszt the owner of a wholesale meat company in los angeles who had double knee replacement surgery in at the age of says the first five months of rehab were very painful and discouraging you re fighting to get range of motion back you re fighting to break adhesions you re fighting depression and you re wondering is an era of your life over but he worked through the pain and was back playing basketball a few months later now he still plays basketball twice a week the

en español by amanda gardner healthday reporter tuesday march healthday news a minimally invasive treatment for enlarged prostate that limits blood supply to the prostate seems to be just as effective as surgery but without the risk of debilitating side effects such as impotence and urinary incontinence the treatment called prostatic artery embolization or pae is ready to be used in certain patients namely those with a prostate larger than cubic centimeters with severe lower urinary tract symptoms and a weakened urinary stream said dr joao martins pisco lead author of a study slated to be presented march at the annual meeting of the society of interventional radiology in chicago but other experts aren t so sure drugs are used to treat most patients with an enlarged prostate with only about percent qualifying for surgery to remove the entire gland said dr elizabeth kavaler a urologist at lenox hill hospital in new york city because medication is so effective most of the patients that we treat surgically are in pretty bad shape she added and while this study showed some symptomatic improvement it didn t have enough objective data to show that the new technique would surpass surgery she said benign prostate hyperplasia also known as enlarged prostate is a non cancerous condition familiar to millions of aging males the condition occurs when the prostate gland slowly enlarges and presses on the urethra constricting the flow of urine enlarged prostate is characterized by a host of unpleasant symptoms including weak or slow urine flow an urgent need to urinate frequently incomplete bladder emptying and having to get up repeatedly at night to urinate the surgery for enlarged prostate transurethral resection of the prostate or turp is used for men whose prostates are smaller than to cubic centimeters the procedure is performed under general anesthesia and involves a hospital stay meanwhile there is no size limitation for pae which requires only local anesthesia and also lowers the risk of other side effects such as blood loss and retrograde ejaculation which occurs when semen leaks into the bladder researchers said pae can be an outpatient procedure as well for the procedure a catheter is inserted into the femoral artery in the groin the catheter delivers tiny grains to the arteries that lead to the prostate which block blood flow and lead to shriveling of the gland in this study pae helped most of the patients who underwent the procedure according to the researchers who noted that men who had not responded to medications experienced improvements in symptoms as well as a reduction in prostate volume after nine months none had experienced sexual dysfunction and percent still reported improvements however the authors did not see as great an improvement in urodynamic results such as improved flow rate of the urine which would indicate how well the bladder and urethra are performing in this area the patients did not improve as much as those who underwent turp surgery they noted another drawback is that few doctors are trained in pae so far said pisco chair of radiology at hospital pulido valente and professor in the faculty of medical sciences at new university of lisbon in portugal other minimally invasive treatments for enlarged prostate that are currently available are less effective and have a greater risk of a need for reoperation according to background materials that accompanied the study dr franklin lowe associate director of urology at st luke s roosevelt hospital in new york city said pae was unlikely to be used much to treat enlarged prostate current surgical procedures typically require no more than one night in the hospital and complications such as incontinence and impotence are uncommon he said pae is potentially fraught with complications lowe said adding that the study follow up of less than one year was short for a disease that lasts decades since the study is being presented at a medical meeting and has not yet been published in a peer reviewed journal the findings should be considered preliminary more information the u s national institutes of health has more on enlarged prostate,1
march a minimally invasive procedure that cuts off the blood supply to an enlarged prostate may help when medications fail and it appears to provide good symptom control without sexual dysfunction a new study shows the procedure involves using a tiny catheter that is threaded through arteries near the groin to reach the vessels that supply the prostate with blood these vessels are then blocked with particles the size of a grain of sand a similar procedure is sometimes used to treat another kind of benign growth uterine fibroids in women it was my inspiration uterine fibroids it s the same kind of growth says study researcher joao martins pisco md chief radiologist at hospital pulido valente and director of interventional radiology at st louis hospital both in lisbon portugal the results are excellent in a small pilot study most men were able to leave the hospital four to eight hours after the procedure which is called prostatic artery embolization pae researchers report pae reduced the symptoms of frequency and urgency of urination without causing side effects like incontinence sexual dysfunction retrograde ejaculation ejaculation into the bladder or bleeding despite the promising results of this small trial experts said it was far too early to recommend pae to patients there are a lot of questions we really don t know what the short and long term success or complication rates are says anthony malizia jr md president and director of the malizia clinic a nonprofit urology specialty center in atlanta we don t know how well these particles are localized to the prostate or if they re going to the pelvis or other parts of the body malizia notes that in one serious complication reported in the study the particles appeared to migrate and kill a small part of the bladder wall the authors report that the dead tissue required surgical removal the study was presented at the society of interventional radiology annual meeting in chicago,1

whether you ve been relatively inactive or fairly athletic age is the enemy of one of the most important sets of muscles in the body the group of four known as the rotator cuff that surround the ball of the shoulder joint about of adults older than have a completely or partially torn rotator cuff compared with just of those between and but tears are most frequently caused by degeneration of the tendon due to age rather than injury from sports or trauma studies show that tears can be managed without surgery in half of patients mainly through physical therapy pain medications and avoiding activities that cause pain but one s strength tends not to improve without surgery to reattach tendons to the ball of the shoulder joint so the question for many patients who want to have full use of their shoulder is less whether to have surgery than when and how in a recent review in the annals of internal medicine researchers noted that patients and doctors struggle with when to stop nonoperative treatment in favor of surgery but that repairing a tear earlier rather than later may result in better patient outcomes earlier return to work and lower costs the price of delay many patients who have a tear figure they can take six months and live with it but left alone the tear will progress and you can get to the point where it is irreparable says david altchek a surgeon at new york s hospital for special surgery dr altchek says repairing torn rotator cuffs earlier with a new technique that uses a double row of sutures to fix tendons to bone rather than a single row is improving healing rates in his studies while some tears may never worsen or need surgery says ken yamaguchi an orthopedic surgeon at the washington university school of medicine in st louis the older somebody is when they get a repair the less likely it is for the repair to heal the good news is that surgery results in reduced pain and improved function in to of patients and open surgery with big incisions is being replaced by new less invasive techniques known as mini open and arthroscopic repair which involve less pain and blood loss shorter hospital stays and a generally easier rehabilitation period according to the american academy of orthopedic surgeons ask your doctor the academy which recently updated its guidelines for rotator cuff repair doesn t recommend for or against a specific technique for surgery dr yamaguchi vice chairman of a working group that developed the guidelines says there isn t enough high quality evidence to recommend any specific technique a conclusion also reached by the annals of internal medicine researchers he advises that patients confer with surgeons about their options the most common procedure is mini open repair which uses a smaller incision than traditional open repair to remove any bone spurs a surgeon uses arthroscopic pencil size instruments to magnify and illuminate the structures inside the joint once that is completed the surgeon repairs the rotator cuff through the small incision but some surgeons are now performing the entire operation using the small camera guided instruments in what s known as an all arthroscopic procedure there are possible complications with all surgical procedures of course an academy of orthopedic surgeons review of about published studies showed that as many as of patients have nerve injuries while may get an infection at the surgical site about may have a tendon re tear though that doesn t mean a repeat surgery will be needed or that pain and poor function will result lengthy recovery and as with any surgery postoperative recovery depends largely on how well patients adhere to their physical therapy regimens initially that means being extra careful a repair needs to be protected until the tendon heals strongly to the bone patients may be advised to use a sling for the first four to six weeks after surgery and to limit active use of the arm therapy usually starts with passive motion exercises then range of motion exercises continue during the next six to weeks it can take as long as six months after surgery to return to a functional range of motion and adequate strength eric taylor a year old documentary filmmaker who plays sports like tennis with his right arm says he was surprised when he began developing pain in his left shoulder he tried to ease it by doing yoga but after six months with no relief he scheduled an mri it confirmed that a bone spur digging into a tendon had caused a tear in the left rotator cuff he scheduled surgery with dr altchek at the hospital for special surgery last june but wishes he had acted sooner because he waited so long he says his surgery required three incisions instead of one he was surprised at how much work was involved in rehabilitation but has been diligent about his recovery and physical therapy back to playing tennis now mr taylor says when it comes to our own bodies as baby boomers we ve always been active and we are going to stay active any way we can ms landro is an assistant managing editor for the wall street journal and writes the paper s informed patient column she can be reached at,1
march elevated levels of a group of five amino acids may predict the development of diabetes years before any noticeable symptoms occur according to a new study researchers found that blood tests that screened for these amino acids accurately predicted risk of type diabetes in otherwise healthy adults as well as in those with traditional risk factors such as obesity these findings could provide insight into metabolic pathways that are altered very early in the process leading to diabetes says researcher thomas wang md of massachusetts general hospital s cardiovascular research center in a news release they also raise the possibility that in selected individuals these measurements could identify those at highest risk of developing diabetes so that early preventive measures could be instituted researchers say metabolic abnormalities that eventually lead to type diabetes can be present years before diabetes is diagnosed for example insulin resistance where the body does not use insulin effectively occurs long before blood sugars reach the level seen in type diabetes,1
how to beat sleep apnea cut it out surgically enlarge this image toggle caption istockphoto com istockphoto com at it just didn t make sense that daniel sheiner was exhausted literally from the moment he woke up it didn t get any better over the course of the day and i knew that was not normal sheiner says sheiner is a software designer and programmer his job suffered as a result of his fatigue i would miss conversations sheiner says i would ask a question that had already been answered sheiner suspected he had sleep apnea because it ran in his family but he was not overweight which is the biggest risk factor for the disorder some percent to percent of patients diagnosed with apnea have a body mass index or bmi over a sleep study confirmed sheiner had one of the worst cases of apnea his doctors had ever seen after trying a number of different treatments his doctors finally tried a surgery using robots to treat his stubborn apnea with positive results gasping for breath according to erica thaler an ear nose and throat surgeon at the hospital of the university of pennsylvania sheiner s sleep study found that he woke up about times every hour that meant sheiner stopped breathing for at least seconds about two times every minute sleep apnea is a chronic and common sleep disorder people with this condition stop breathing while sleeping like sheiner they often find themselves suddenly and repeatedly gasping for breath during the night their airway is clogged sometimes because their tonsils and tonsilar tissue in the back of their throat are enlarged this was exactly the case for sheiner daniel s obstruction was both at the level of the soft palate and at the back of the tongue thaler says he had very large tonsils but his tonsil tissue was also enlarged in the palate area and also at the back of his tongue sheiner was put on a nighttime breathing machine in bed he wore a face mask which was connected to a tube that was connected to a device that pumped air into his nose and mouth the continuous positive airway pressure machine or cpap as it is often referred to works for about half of all patients who try it it can be cumbersome thaler says but sheiner was extremely committed to trying it in fact he tried a number of different types of machines but none of them worked handing surgery off to robots so thaler suggested a type of robotic surgery currently used to remove cancerous tumors at the back of the throat thaler was starting to perform it on sleep apnea patients to remove tonsils and excess tissue what the robot allows you to do is get into a small confined space without using hands thaler says human hands are huge and robot hands are tiny and yet they can do exactly the same thing if you control them remotely so about a year ago thaler performed surgery on sheiner removing both his tonsils and excess tissue sheiner is one of only about a half dozen patients to have this robotic surgery for apnea after surgery sheiner says it was a whole new life he had energy an ability to focus and get things done i find myself solving problems much more quickly and more confidently he s exercising at the gym three times a week lifting weights he is also starting to experiment with recipes and cooking something he had absolutely no energy or interest in doing before the surgery surgery not for everyone the surgery sheiner had isn t right for everyone rashmi n aurora is a sleep specialist at mount sinai school of medicine in new york she is also chairwoman of the standards of practice committee of the american academy of sleep medicine i wouldn t send a middle age obese man for surgery as their first option aurora says i would say let s lose the weight let s use cpap and see a nutritionist let s avoid the alcohol and let s see how you do the apnea can probably be taken care of with these noninvasive techniques she says and invasive surgery can be avoided but when she sees a young thin person with severe apnea aurora says surgery might be the answer the upper airway starts with the nose and mouth and runs down to the vocal chords so there s a lot of room for obstruction to occur aurora says some patients may require surgery to remove the uvula or the tonsils or excess tissue or all of them she says then there s surgery to remove blockage in the nasal passage oftentimes aurora says patients need a series of surgeries to completely treat apnea and even then success rates aren t high they re effective only to percent of the time the only surgery proved effective more than percent of the time is a significant and highly invasive surgery maxillomandibular advancement or mma involves literally slicing the jaw in half and moving it forward in order to widen the patient s airway for patients with recessed chins small jaws and airways narrowed by facial structure this might be the surgery for them but it can take nearly a year to recover and many patients opt not to have it the new cpap machines are more sophisticated aurora says they re less cumbersome less noisy and can actually sense the magnitude of blockage and adjust air pressure being blown into the nose or mouth she says noninvasive measures are always the first lines of defense she says,1
say aaa then zzz tonsillectomy helps kids sleep toggle caption maggie starbard npr getting your tonsils out used to be just part of childhood a rite of passage for children in the s and s then it fell out of favor but tonsillectomy is back today the most common reason for the surgery is sleep disordered breathing a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring about percent of elementary school age children snore doctors say snoring can cause bed wetting behavior problems short stature and poor school performance that s a far cry from the s and s when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats back then it was the most popular surgery in the united states in the s sitcom leave it to beaver beaver cleaver was so impressed by his dad s tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out even though he didn t need it turning point for tonsillectomies it was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections people were growing up with their tonsils the tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body s immune system the premise of tonsillectomies back in their heyday was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs then doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats even after having their tonsils taken out but it wasn t until clinical trials were completed in the early s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe recurrent throat infections it was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections says richard rosenfeld an ear nose and throat doctor at suny downstate in brooklyn n y people were growing up with their tonsils but growing up with tonsils can create another problem snoring lisa moran of takoma park md remembers what it sounded like when her son tyler scorza now age slept enlarge this image toggle caption maggie starbard npr maggie starbard npr it was loud moran says you could hear him through he closed door down the hall snoring and he would occasionally stop breathing at first tyler s pediatrician thought he d outgrow the snoring but he wasn t sleeping well and often didn t have any energy the doctor recommended a head x ray and the radiologist said that though tyler s adenoids were enlarged they weren t that bad by then tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years he started getting frequent nasal infections so his parents took him to an ear nose and throat doctor he said sure the adenoids are swollen but the real problem is the tonsils moran recalls he showed us on the x ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat very small enlarged tonsils and adenoids are the most common cause of sleep disordered breathing in children so the doctor recommended tonsillectomy complications from surgery but tyler s parents were worried about the surgery it s usually done as an outpatient procedure now but with general anesthesia that s never without some risk your child is under says moran completely under this is not a local other complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding about percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital despite hundreds of studies there s still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats the operation continues to be controversial what s a sleep study sleep studies are a way for doctors to diagnose sleep disorders like apnea by observing patients overnight while they sleep during a sleep study the patient is connected to an array of sensors monitoring brainwaves eye movements heart rate breathing and blood oxygen levels this information called a polysomnogram lets doctors see whether the patient has stopped breathing and for how long apnea in adults happens when seconds pass without breathing for children it s a disruption of two cycles of inhaling and exhaling some patients can also use portable sleep monitors to record what s happening in their sleep as an alternative to the sleep study but that approach is not as comprehensive many sleep disorders can be diagnosed without costly sleep studies which can run anywhere from to several thousand dollars more children are undergoing sleep studies as awareness of the condition particularly in children rises the american academy of sleep medicine says about percent of children have obstructive sleep apnea before a sleep study is ordered doctors typically ask for medical and sleep histories and a physical exam eliza barclay no less a personage than president obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in july in a prime time news conference obama said that doctors may think you know what i make a lot more money if i take this kid s tonsils out rosenfeld disputes obama s claim saying insurers usually pay a surgeon to for tonsil surgery sleep study before tonsillectomy the picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep disordered breathing or frequent throat infections because of that in the american academy of pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered about tonsillectomies are performed in the united states each year obviously parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed in january the american academy of otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children with sore throats the ents recommend waiting and treatment with antibiotics if needed unless a child has more than seven infections in a year they d recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years or three or more in three years there have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep disordered breathing most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements and looked at a single measure like behavior or quality of life still the ents recommend tonsillectomy for sleep disordered breathing saying it reduces symptoms in most children tyler s family decided to go ahead with the surgery they went to the hospital at a m and tyler was home by noon the doctors said he would be out of school for a week but a throat infection kept him home a second week his classmates sent him get well cards a year later tyler is feeling great and his snoring is gone completely

en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter sunday march healthday news a simple blood test may one day offer a safe way to detect down syndrome during pregnancy researchers say in a small study an experimental blood test identified a gene mutation associated with down syndrome with percent accuracy according to the cyprus scientists down syndrome is a common birth defect with one down syndrome birth in every births in all populations said lead researcher philippos patsalis chief executive medical director of the cyprus institute of neurology and genetics in nicosia this is due to an extra chromosome and that leads to physical and mental impairment with our method we identify all normal and all down syndrome pregnancies patsalis said currently down syndrome is diagnosed using one of two invasive procedures amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling because these tests while percent accurate carry a percent to percent risk of miscarriage only about one in pregnant women opts for them he said the new test eliminates the risk of miscarriage patsalis said it also can identify down syndrome in the th week of pregnancy early enough for a woman to end her pregnancy if she chooses patsalis said although down syndrome varies in severity it usually causes some intellectual impairment and distinguishing facial features heart defects and other health problems are also common according to the march of dimes older mothers are more likely to give birth to down syndrome babies people with down syndrome also known as trisomy carry three copies of chromosome instead of two for the study published online march in nature medicine patsalis and his colleagues took blood samples from pregnant women and mothers of down syndrome and healthy babies in each case the test quickly pinpointed the chromosomal variation identifying down syndrome cases and normal fetuses the study authors said if larger clinical trials confirm the results the test could become standard practice patsalis said the cost is much lower than the invasive procedures he said we estimate we can introduce this to clinical practice in a couple of years dr brian skotko clinical fellow in genetics at children s hospital boston and a spokesman for the national down syndrome society said this study has widespread implications for the incidence of down syndrome with this new test women will know if their baby has down syndrome even before they look pregnant skotko said so they will be able to make a very personal decision without anyone realizing it he said noting that most of his down syndrome patients say they lead fulfilling lives skotko said the overwhelming majority of family members say they can t imagine their life without their family member with down syndrome more information for more information on down syndrome visit the u s national library of medicine,1
nicosia london reuters pregnant women may soon be able to have a blood test to predict whether their babies are likely to have down s syndrome instead of undergoing risky invasive tests scientists said on sunday in a study in the nature medicine journal researchers from cyprus said a trial on pregnancies using the test which involves analyzing the woman s blood to detect dna differences between the mother and the fetus showed it accurately predicted which fetuses were at risk of developing the syndrome philippos patsalis medical director of the cyprus institute of neurology and genetics who led the study said the results were very exciting and the test now needed to be trialed in a larger study of about pregnancies but could lead to changes in clinical practice within two years we believe we can modify this test and make it much easier and simple and then we can have something ready to be introduced into the clinic he told reuters in nicosia down s syndrome is the most common genetic cause of mental retardation occurring in out of live births worldwide the risk of having a baby with down s which occurs when a child has three copies of chromosome instead of the normal two increases sharply as women get older the risk for a year old mother is times that for one who is doctors currently use a test known as amniocentesis to check whether a baby is likely to be born with down s this test is generally done at about or weeks gestation and involves taking amniotic fluid from the mother by inserting a hollow needle into the uterus since amniocentesis carries a small risk of spontaneous miscarriage patsalis put it at around one or two percent scientists have been looking for new less invasive ways to test for down s and other potential genetic problems patsalis method takes advantage of differences in the dna methylation patterns which are important to control levels of genes between mother and fetus it involves taking a small amount of blood from the mother when she is between the th and th week of her pregnancy and detecting extra copies chromosome in the fetus by analyzing the maternal blood in a small trial patsalis team were able to correctly diagnose cases where there were extra copies of the chromosome and normal fetuses results they said highlighted its clinical potential such a non invasive approach will avoid the risk of miscarriages of normal pregnancies caused by current more invasive procedures the scientists wrote in their paper,1
a study finds that use of virtual colonoscopy a non invasive way of scanning the colon for potentially cancerous growths is on the rise that s a bit of a surprise given that not all medical experts agree on whether the virtual screen is as reliable as a traditional colonoscopy in which doctors insert a scope with a small camera into the colon plus medicare does not currently reimburse patients for routine screening with virtual colonoscopy but does cover evaluations with colonoscopy add to that the aggressive public awareness campaign for colonoscopy screening led by celebrities like katie couric who allowed tv cameras in as she got her first test and it s clear why more people are familiar with the scope than with its virtual cousin but in spite of those challenges megan mchugh at the health research and educational trust in chicago and her team report that about of hospitals in the u s now offer the screening test up from in as its name implies virtual colonoscopy is way to survey the colon without actually using a scope patients lie in a ct scanner which takes a series of pictures from a variety of different angles and a computer compiles the snapshots in two different ways the images can be viewed as two dimensional ct scans which display any possible abnormalities protruding from the lining of the colon or the images can be combined to generate a d view of the colon allowing the doctors to fly through the organ looking for any suspicious growths or protrusions the prep for both the virtual and actual colonoscopy is the same the dreaded colon cleanse that many patients find is the worst part of the procedure the night before the test they start drinking clear liquids and take agents to loosen their stools and empty their colon so any remaining debris isn t mistaken for a tumor during the screen while the virtual colonoscopy does not require the sedation and insertion of a scope that colonoscopy does it involves exposure to a small amount of radiation but according to dr marc gollub director of ct and gastrointestinal radiology at memorial sloan kettering cancer center the radiation is much lower than a regular ct scan and has not been proven to be of any risk it s similar to the exposure from cosmic radiation you might get on a long airplane flight while a growing body of data suggest that virtual colonoscopy is as sensitive as colonoscopy in picking up potential tumors not all cancer experts agree that it s a good alternative to the gold standard scope while the american cancer society the american college of physicians and other gastroenterology experts recommend virtual screening every five years the u s preventive services task force a congressionally mandated but non federal independent group of medical experts concluded the evidence wasn t strong enough to justify medicare coverage of the service so which one is right for you virtual colonoscopy is a good option for those who can t be sedated for colonoscopy or who simply can t tolerate the scope in mchugh s survey hospitals reported that these patients make up the bulk of their use and given the relatively low cost of investing in the software and other equipment required to run a virtual scan more hospitals may be adding the option to their patient services the virtual scan does involve radiation exposure and if doctors find an abnormality that needs to be removed you ll have to undergo a colonoscopy anyway to avoid another colon cleanse consider scheduling a colonoscopy on the same day in case tumors need to be removed but gollub notes that only about of healthy adults getting regularly screened actually have tumors given the fact that more hospitals are offering virtual colonoscopy it s worth discussing with your doctor in the end it s a matter of personal preference it s less important how you get screened just that you do get screened,1
as a nicotine gum addict mike metzger used to worry about the warning on its label stop using the nicotine gum at the end of weeks but that was before a prominent smoking cessation scientist k michael cummings told him to keep chewing the gum as long as it helped him stay off cigarettes so years after quitting smoking mr metzger a year old retired new york telephone worker still chews pieces of nicotine gum a day public health officials are backing away from recommending against the long term use of nicotine gum lozenges and patches the food and drug administration is considering whether to eliminate the week warning and instead recommend nicotine based quit smoking aids for extended perhaps even permanent use anti tobacco activists and glaxosmithkline plc the u s s leading marketer of nicotine replacement therapy or nrt are also backing the potential move there really doesn t appear to be any great harm with long term use of nrt says mr cummings chair of the department of health behavior in the cancer prevention division at the roswell park cancer institute in buffalo n y you re better off chewing gum or wearing a patch than smoking by giving former smokers the most addictive chemical in cigarettes nicotine nrt is designed to ease the difficulty of quitting in more than a quarter century on the market nicotine gum lozenges and patches have amassed a strong safety record even among most long term nrt users the hazards of nicotine pale beside the dangers of smoking which is the number one cause of lung cancer and the most preventable cause of cardiac death nicotine itself is not believed by scientists to raise the risk of developing cancer it may raise the risk of cardiovascular disease however it can elevate heart rate constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure some people have adverse skin reactions to nicotine patches like other addictive substances nicotine essentially hijacks the brain s reward system conditioning users to associate intake with pleasure but while other addictive drugs tend either to stimulate or relax users nicotine can do both depending on the user s mood giving it a particularly tight grip sudden withdrawal from the drug can induce intense cravings nervousness irritability confusion and insomnia among other symptoms obtaining nicotine from gum lozenge or patch doesn t replace entirely the pleasure of smoking any more than popping a tablet of caffeine the addictive element in coffee could equal the pleasure of a fresh brewed cup of cappuccino but jolts of nicotine can reduce the physical symptoms of withdrawal while quitters battle longings for the taste of tobacco the sensation of smoke and various rituals that accompany the habit going off nrt can also lead to withdrawal symptoms studies typically funded by nrt manufacturers have shown that those who use the products are about twice as likely to quit smoking after weeks compared to those who don t use nrt but studies of those who successfully quit outside of nrt clinical trials often show no nrt advantage over the cold turkey approach about one in five american adults smokes a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since nrt makers offer different dosages for heavy and light smokers and recommend that the frequency of use decline over time for instance from a piece of gum every hour or two in the first six weeks of quitting to every four to eight hours in weeks through glaxo products which include nicorette gum and lozenges and nicoderm patches account for more than half of the million market in annual u s retail sales of over the counter smoking cessation aids according to market research firm euromonitor international pfizer inc and novartis ag also market nrt those skeptical of any move to eliminate warnings on long term nrt use note that many public health officials and anti tobacco agencies have received funding from nrt s makers there s no money to be made in cold turkey quitting even though cold turkey is how the vast majority of former smokers kicked the habit says john polito editor of whyquit a popular blog that endorses cold turkey cessation from tobacco the fda has faced increasing pressure in recent years to loosen its rules on quit smoking aids some public health groups have filed petitions with the agency urging changes another impetus is the landmark law signed by president barack obama that for the first time empowered the fda to regulate tobacco products the law which is partly aimed at reducing smoking s toll on the nation s health instructs the agency to consider rewriting the warnings on nicotine replacement products which range from eight to weeks depending on the type the warnings date back to when nicotine gum first received fda approval back in they weren t based on hard science connecting health hazards to long term nicotine addiction but were set to mirror the length of use in clinical trials britain s royal college of physicians which sets health standards in the u k concluded in a report on nicotine addiction that medicinal nicotine is a very safe drug and there are no grounds to suspect appreciable long term adverse effects on health many other countries have less stringent policies on nrt canada germany japan and the u k have approved recommended use periods of anywhere from six to months a few studies have examined the use of nrt beyond the current recommendations last year researchers at the university of pennsylvania published a study in annals of internal medicine that found that smokers who use a nicotine patch for weeks may be more likely to stay off cigarettes than those treated for eight weeks however the study reported no difference in the quit rates of the two groups when they were checked at the one year mark revealing the fact that many people began smoking again the senior author of the study funded by federal grants has served as a consultant for glaxosmithkline barbara gregg says that without nicotine gum she likely would have returned to smoking ms gregg a year old executive assistant in the university of minnesota s department of medicine smoked for years before she quit by going cold turkey in she started chewing the gum about six months later after experiencing nicotine cravings in before the start of her mother s funeral she kept her father company as he smoked a cigarette in the parking lot i can guarantee you that if i didn t have nicotine gum with me i absolutely would have bummed a cigarette off my dad and picked back up again she says write to david kesmodel at and kevin helliker at,1
en español monday feb healthday news cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may be able to avoid the accompanying muscle loss and malnutrition by taking fish oil supplements that contain omega fatty acids new research suggests the finding is based on a small study involving just lung cancer patients nevertheless it raises hope that a simple noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo induced muscle mass loss fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer study author dr vera mazurak of the university of alberta in edmonton canada said in a news release this holds great promise because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer related malnutrition mazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the feb online edition of cancer to explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements the authors offered cancer patients undergoing an initial week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of grams of a particular omega fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic epa while these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment a second group of patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil the results continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over pounds the supplement group lost no weight what s more blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream epa concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains specifically nearly percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre chemo muscle mass or gained muscle by comparison less than percent in the non supplement group kept their original muscle mass total fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation the team noted and no side effects were observed the authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss lona sandon a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the university of texas southwestern dallas reacted with cautious optimism to the findings malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation she noted because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores and then with chemotherapy there is some inflammation that s detrimental to the heart and muscle as it can cause muscle breakdown and preservation of lean muscle tissue we know leads to better outcomes so certainly this does seem to be promising sandon said and other similar studies have looked at omega and muscle preservation and have also suggested that fish oil can act to prevent inflammation caused by both disease and hardcore medications like chemotherapy agents but i would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot she added much much more than any recommended dietary allowance along the lines of two to three servings of fish per week but she said i would say this is certainly worthy of continuing research and exploration but meanwhile people should definitely not go out and start consuming huge amounts of fish oil more information for more on chemotherapy visit the american cancer society,1

by steven reinberg healthday reporter tuesday feb healthday news people who take drugs called bisphosphonates to prevent bone loss may also reduce their risk of developing colorectal cancer by almost percent compared to those not on the drugs a new study suggests bisphosphonates include such common drugs as fosamax alendronate boniva ibandronate actonel risedronate and reclast zoledronic acid these drugs work by increasing bone thickness thereby reducing the risk of fractures the researchers said in prior studies bisphosphonates have already been shown to be associated with a reduced odds for breast cancer these new findings are meaningful because they point to a possible protective effect of this class of drugs being relevant to prevention of many different cancers said lead researcher dr gad rennert from the technion israel institute of technology faculty of medicine and chairman of the department of community medicine and epidemiology at the carmel medical center of clalit health services in haifa israel this is similar to the effect that we and others have shown for cholesterol lowering statins he said noting that bisphosphonates and statins share the same metabolic pathway the results of the u s national cancer institute supported study are published in the feb issue of the journal of clinical oncology for the study rennert s team collected data on almost postmenopausal women who took part in the molecular epidemiology of colorectal cancer study which is a population based trial in northern israel the researchers found that taking bisphosphonates mostly fosamax for at least a year was associated with a significant percent reduction in relative risk for colorectal cancer the magnitude of the reduced risk is less important because this is an association study however it is very significant after controlling for a dozen other known risk factors rennert said they took into account factors such as family history ethnic background diet physical activity weight vitamin d consumption and the use of other drugs such as aspirin statins and hormone replacement therapy the findings in this study show that bisphosphonates are associated with a reduced risk of developing colorectal cancer but they cannot confirm a causal effect that is the study doesn t prove that the use of bisphosphonates is responsible for the lower risk of colorectal cancer however the lowered risk of colorectal cancer seen with bisphosphonates may be due to the way the drug acts in the body which is similar to how cholesterol lowering drugs called statins work according to rennert these same researchers also found in another study that statin use also reduced the risk of colorectal cancer he noted we also found a similar effect last year with risk of breast cancer which has already been replicated by three other groups rennert added a randomized trial is need to prove that bisphosphonates are protective against colorectal cancer rennert said it should be relatively easy as it seems that all that is needed is a year of treatment to see the effect he said the researchers noted however that the risks of using bisphosphonates include the possibility in rare cases of osteonecrosis of the jaw destruction of the jawbone or jaw tissue bisphosphonates used for osteoporosis have also been linked to a rare fracture of the thigh according to the u s food and drug administration the adverse effects profile is of major importance if bisphosphonates are going to be recommended for cancer prevention in healthy people the study authors cautioned commenting on the study eric jacobs strategic director of pharmacoepidemiology at the american cancer society said that the lower risk of colorectal cancer risk seen among bisphosphonate users in this study is intriguing however these results should be interpreted with caution and require confirmation by additional studies he said results from the only other study of bisphosphonate use and colorectal cancer a recent large study from the united kingdom do not support an important protective effect jacobs noted fortunately there are other proven ways to help lower risk of colorectal cancer he said in particular all americans or older should get a screening test so that precancerous polyps can be detected and removed before they turn into cancer more information for more information on colon cancer visit the american cancer society,1
parkinson s disease is a progressive neurological disease that causes symptoms including muscle tremors shaking and stiffness the cause of the disease is unknown and the risk of developing it increases with age this is the first study in humans to examine the association between flavonoids and risk of developing parkinson s disease says researcher xiang gao md phd of the harvard school of public health in boston in a news release our findings suggest that flavonoids specifically a group called anthocyanins may have neuroprotective effects if confirmed flavonoids may be a natural and healthy way to reduce your risk of developing parkinson s disease a new study shows men who ate the most foods rich in a group of antioxidants known as flavonoids were less likely to develop parkinson s disease than those who ate the least major dietary sources of flavonoids include berries apples tea red wine chocolate and citrus fruits feb incorporating berries and other fruits in your diet may pay off by reducing the risk of parkinson s disease berries blunt parkinson s disease risk the study to be presented in april at the annual meeting of the american academy of neurology in honolulu looked at the relationship between flavonoid intake and parkinson s disease in men who participated in the health professional follow up study and women who participated in the nurses health study the participants were followed for years and filled out questionnaires about the foods they ate researchers calculated total flavonoid intake based on the participants consumption of five flavonoid rich foods included on the questionnaires tea berries apples red wine and oranges orange juice the results showed that men who ate the most foods rich in flavonoids had a lower risk of parkinson s disease compared with those who ate the least no link between overall flavonoid consumption and parkinson s disease risk was found in women but when researchers looked at specific sub groups of flavonoids they found both men and women who ate the most foods rich in anthocyanins which are found primarily in berries and apples had a lower risk of parkinson s disease compared to those who ate the least the study doesn t prove that berries or flavonoids in any other food prevent parkinson s disease this was an observational study and therefore can t establish cause and effect nor is it clear why the results differed for men and women this study will be presented at a medical conference the findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the peer review process in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal,0
feb los angeles giving clot busting drugs to people with mild strokes could prevent more than of them from becoming disabled each year researchers say a stroke occurs when a clot cuts off blood flow to parts of the brain those parts of the brain soon start to die a drug called tissue plasminogen activator tpa dissolves clots and restores blood flow mild strokes characterized by such symptoms as clumsiness in the hand weakness of an extremity some slurred speech temporary loss of vision and or dizziness account for more than half of strokes in the u s but people with mild strokes are typically denied tpa because the studies that established its effectiveness excluded mild cases says pooja khatri md of the university of cincinnati it s been assumed that people with mild strokes generally do well and the risk of tpa treatment which includes a slight but significant risk of life threatening bleeding in the brain would not be worth the benefit she says in fact one in three people who suffer a mild stroke are disabled three months later khatri says,1
london england cnn researchers hope a new treatment developed in the united kingdom will prove vital in controlling future flu pandemics such as h n swine flu bird flu as well as ending the need for annual flu jabs developed by scientists at oxford university the new vaccine works by targeting protein cells inside the influenza a virus instead of current vaccines that attack proteins on the outside of the flu virus according to sarah gilbert head of the project at oxford s jenner institute this method is effective because proteins inside the virus are far more similar across all the influenza strains and are less likely to mutate in the first successful trial on humans healthy people were vaccinated and infected with the seasonal flu strain along with non vaccinated volunteers the results say gilbert are important in developing a new form of protection that researchers hope could spell the end of flu vaccination supply problems the most recent global pandemic was the h n flu pandemic in which the estimates of deaths ranged as high as in the u s alone according to the centers for disease control and prevention gilbert explained with the swine flu pandemic it took four months before the first doses of the vaccine were available and there was only a small amount available gilbert explained it took a further six months before it was possible to vaccinate a large number of people with this type of vaccine you would at least be able to start using the vaccine as soon as you knew a new pandemic was starting you could stockpile the vaccine and wouldn t have this wait to make a new pandemic specific vaccine she said the vaccine would be an important step in treating seasonal flu not just pandemics flu kills every year it s not just swine flu normally it s the very old or very young that die from flu but every year there are deaths from influenza a said gilbert in the u s alone it s believed about people die from seasonal flu related causes in an average year according to the cdc the initial results are positive says peter palese professor and chair of microbiology at mount sinai school of medicine new york but more research is needed before the new treatment is approved i think it s a very interesting and very elegant approach and the data so far looks very very good he said but although the vaccine has been give to humans unfortunately there is no evidence presented to say if it really results in protection against infection gilbert agrees more work is required before the vaccine becomes available estimating a wait of at least five year but says the results are a fundamental next step in the treatment of flu it s fairly certain flu vaccines are going to change a lot in the next few years she said whether it s this vaccine or another one someone else develops i don t think we ll be continuing with the type of flu vaccines that we have at the moment,1

by serena gordon healthday reporter thursday feb healthday news a special restrictive diet may significantly reduce symptoms of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd in young children a new study suggests when children between the ages of and were placed on a diet containing no processed foods for five weeks adhd symptoms diminished in percent of them and when suspected trouble foods were reintroduced into the diet two thirds of the children experienced a relapse in symptoms a strictly supervised restricted elimination diet is a valuable instrument to assess whether adhd is induced by food wrote the study authors we think that dietary intervention should be considered in all children with adhd provided parents are willing to follow a diagnostic restricted elimination diet for a five week period and provided expert supervision is available they concluded results of the study are published in the feb issue of the lancet adhd is a common childhood disorder according to the national institute of mental health nimh children with adhd have trouble paying attention focusing and can be hyperactive parents have long suspected that sugary foods might be a culprit in inducing symptoms but there s not a lot of evidence to support this theory according to the nimh however food additives and preservatives have recently been singled out as possibly having an effect on children s behavior though the evidence isn t yet conclusive since some children have negative physical reactions to certain foods such as eczema asthma and gastrointestinal problems that affect different organ systems it has been suggested that foods may also affect the brain in a way that results in adverse behavior according to information in the study to test this theory the researchers recruited children from belgium and the netherlands the children were between the ages of and and all had been diagnosed with adhd most of the children were boys the children were randomly assigned to one of two groups one group was placed on the restrictive elimination diet and the other group served as a control group and received advice on healthy eating the restrictive diet began with a diet called the few foods diet which includes just rice meat vegetables pears and water the researchers then complemented this diet with certain foods such as potatoes fruits and wheat the restrictive diet lasted for five weeks during the next four weeks kids in the restricted diet group received two food challenge diets in which certain foods were reintroduced into the diet the researchers selected foods that were considered both low and high igg foods igg is an antibody made by the immune system that some alternative medicine practitioners believe is linked to food hypersensitivities however igg testing is controversial among many mainstream physicians and even some naturopaths according to background information in the study some complementary medicine practices test for igg and recommend eliminating foods high in igg explained dr jaswinder ghuman who wrote an accompanying editorial in the same issue of the journal forty one children completed the restrictive phase of the diet of those percent had a reduction in their adhd symptoms compared with no improvement in the controls nine children percent didn t respond to the diet on an adhd symptom scale that ranges from to points with a higher score indicating more severe symptoms the average reduction was points according to the study thirty children who had shown a response on the restrictive diet went on to the challenge test nineteen of those children had a relapse in symptoms on the challenge test what s more it didn t appear to matter if the children with challenged with a low or high igg food measuring igg levels in kids doesn t seem helpful ghuman said but it does look as if the elimination diet may help some children if parents have noticed that a child s behavior seems to get worse with certain foods it may be worth considering said ghuman who is an associate professor of psychiatry and pediatrics at the university of arizona in tucson but for this diet to work you have to be very consistent with it and you have to pay attention to nutrition it should be done under the supervision of a primary care doctor and if possible a dietician she advised ghuman said that this study doesn t answer a number of questions such as whether or not the elimination diet reduces symptoms long term and she added that clinical practice shouldn t be changed based on the results of one study dr andrew adesman chief of developmental and behavioral pediatrics at the steven and alexandra cohen children s medical center of new york in new hyde park echoed ghuman s concerns since none of the children stayed on the diet beyond five weeks it is hard to know if this dietary intervention offers sustained benefit he said adding since it is more difficult to enforce restricted diets in older children this approach may not be suitable for the majority of older children with adhd adesman also pointed out that this study is only applicable to children with adhd not to children who had add without the hyperactivity component more information learn more about adhd from the national institute of mental health,1
feb children with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder adhd should be offered a special adhd diet to see if eliminating certain foods might reduce their symptoms dutch researchers say the diet studied known as the restricted elimination diet red can work the researchers say because they believe adhd symptoms in some children might be affected by eating specific foods i am of the opinion that every child deserves this diagnostic intervention researcher lidy pelsser phd of the adhd research centre in eindhoven the netherlands tells webmd in the study published in the lancet of children who stuck with the diet did respond by having fewer symptoms in five weeks of trying the diet pelsser says parents will know if their child is responding or not if not they can move on to other treatments u s experts had some caveats saying that the results of the study which included children should be repeated in other populations to see if the findings hold up,1

london reuters life britain s leading heart charity launched a million pound million research project on tuesday into the potential of stem cells to regenerate heart tissue and mend broken hearts scientists leading the work for the british heart foundation bhf said they hope that within the next decade they may have experimental drugs in development that would give certain kinds of cells in the heart the ability to regenerate tissue repair damage and therefore combat heart failure the ability of heart tissue to regenerate already occurs in some animals such as zebrafish which can regrow portions of their own hearts if they are damaged at a briefing in london to launch a mending broken hearts fundraising campaign scientists said research into stem cells and developmental biology may in future make this possible in people too scientifically mending human hearts is an achievable goal and we really could make recovering from a heart attack as simple as getting over a broken leg said professor peter weissberg medical director at the bhf scientists in the united states reported last year that they had been able to turn structural heart cells into beating cells by identifying genes that in a developing embryo turn an immature cell into a beating heart cell or cardiomyocyte one of the british teams led by professor paul riley of the institute of child health at university college london ucl has already found a natural protein called thymosin beta that plays a role in developing heart tissue he said his researchers had already had some success in using this protein to wake up cells known as epicardial cells in mice with damaged hearts we hope to find similar molecules or drug like compounds that might be able to stimulate these cells further he told reporters at the briefing another team of researchers at imperial college london will be looking at a group of rare latent stem cells that can be harvested and then grown in the laboratory these cells are highly active in developing hearts and can grow into new functioning tissue but something in them gets switched off soon after humans are born meaning that the heart is no longer able to repair any damage said professor michael schneider who leads this team his researchers will be trying to find ways of re activating the cells in a controlled and safe way so that they are able to repair damaged heart tissue but will not grow out of control one strategy would be to give a drug that would activate this kind of process he said adding that this requires more knowledge about what signals trigger these cells weissberg said if the research was as successful as they hoped it could one day reduce or even eliminate the need for heart transplants for patients whose hearts are damaged editing by steve addison,0
doctor challenges cause of ms and treatment one day years ago after a long walk with his dog along the hudson river in manhattan marc stecker noticed he was limping not long after he was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis fast forward now and my entire right side is pretty much paralyzed and my left side is weakening stecker says enlarge this image toggle caption cleveland clinic center for medical art photography cleveland clinic center for medical art photography cleveland clinic center for medical art photography cleveland clinic center for medical art photography stecker is now confined to a wheelchair from where he writes a blog about his disease called wheelchair kamikaze more than a year ago stecker started writing about a theory italian physician paolo zamboni proposed in called chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency or ccsvi it s been thought that multiple sclerosis is caused by a misguided immune system that attacks the nerves of the brain and spinal cord and can lead to muscle weakness paralysis and death however zamboni suggests that the disease instead is the result of blocked blood veins leading to inflammation which in turn causes the immune system to attack nerves in the brain and spinal cord zamboni proposed that treating it may be as simple as opening them up stecker was hopeful because my disease is so aggressive i have been very willing to be equally aggressive in trying to combat it stecker says the liberation procedure to clear the veins his doctor tried opening them with a tiny balloon zamboni calls it the liberation procedure but it is actually a common technique known as angioplasty when it s used to open clogged arteries not veins a brief history of multiple sclerosis in augustus d este the grandson of england s king george iii began documenting his illness which would one day be identified as multiple sclerosis since d este s day researchers have learned how to better treat the disease but have not yet found a cure here is a timeline of some key events along the way scientists identify multiple sclerosis as a distinct condition myelin which insulates nerve fibers is discovered in ms the body erodes the myelin which damages nerve fibers and interrupts brain signals using a microscope james dawson examines the brains of people who died from ms he is able to describe in depth the damage done by the disease researchers use a hormone typically made by the pituitary gland to treat the symptoms of ms the mri is first used to help diagnose ms reducing diagnosis time from seven years to six months after the first symptom doctors begin using a drug called beta interferon b to reduce disease flare ups paolo zamboni proposes the theory chronic cerebrospinal venous insufficiency from the national multiple sclerosis society at first i was very skeptical but anecdotal reports started coming through of almost miraculous results from it so i decided you know hey it was worth a shot stecker says but it didn t work although the doctor who treated him in new york found a significant blockage he was unable to correct it stecker says still some would say stecker was lucky many desperate patients have spent their life savings flying overseas to have the procedure only to have it fail a few months later others elect to have tiny metal tubes known as stents placed in the veins to hold them open and have suffered serious complications including life threatening blood clots several patients have even died as a result stecker says if he had it to do over again he would have waited for more research but he says he was eager to try something that offered him the first real glimmer of hope for a cure ccsvi equals hope and a lot of ms patients just are completely devoid of hope stecker says people don t want to have ms they want to go back to who they used to be you know along comes this theory that offers an easy to understand solution so it s very very very seductive growing public controversy it s so seductive in fact that canadians and americans with ms have been flocking overseas to get the liberation procedure something that many researchers find very troubling robert zivadinov of the buffalo neuroimaging analysis center in new york says that not only is the procedure unsafe and costly to many patients it is impeding necessary research enlarge this image toggle caption cleveland clinic center for medical art photography cleveland clinic center for medical art photography even if the treatment is not useful for patients with ms i don t think that we can abandon the idea of vascular involvement in ms zivadinov says and i think this merits very detailed understanding of what is going on what is going on is still a bit of a mystery critics argue that although zamboni s original research suggests a vascular cause for ms other studies don t these discrepancies and growing public controversy prompted the national multiple sclerosis society in the u s and the multiple sclerosis society of canada to take zamboni s claims seriously they funded a number of independent studies to investigate the relationship between ccsvi and ms robert fox a neurologist at the cleveland clinic currently oversees one of the studies funded by an ms society grant he says part of the confusion comes from variations in how ccsvi is measured that s absolutely one of the potential problems in the previous studies are the techs who got negative results did they just not know how to do the ultrasound in the way that dr zamboni described doing the ultrasound and that s a very important issue fox says fox says he sent his technicians to a special training to learn how to properly measure the veins because it s not something most technicians ever do bigger than multiple sclerosis meanwhile in buffalo zivadinov says his research on ccsvi already shows a clear picture emerging ccsvi is not the cause of ms but might be a consequence or a contributing factor to progression and i think that has to be studied zivadinov says studying how the vascular system is involved in neurologic disease is an entirely new concept zivadinov says one that may have an impact beyond any single disease what professor zamboni discovered in terms of veins is something much bigger than multiple sclerosis zivadinov says we need to understand the role of the venous system in the pathology of central nervous diseases and aging zamboni himself says that even if it turns out he s wrong coming to a greater understanding of the disease would be the big reward both for him and thousands of ms patients,1
chicago reuters a new analysis of evidence used by a u s advisory panel to roll back breast cancer screening guidelines suggests it may have ignored evidence that more frequent mammograms save more lives u s researchers said on tuesday researchers at the university of colorado and university of michigan studied some of the same risk models used by the u s preventive services task force uspstf to issue controversial breast screening guidelines in those guidelines recommended against routine mammograms for women in their s and said women in their s should get mammograms every other year instead of every year in the new analysis the team found that annual mammograms starting at age save more women from breast cancer than mammograms done every other year in women and older it is not a small difference said dr mark helvie of the university of michigan health system who worked on the study published in the february issue of the american journal of roentgenology his team calculated that a woman who gets a yearly mammogram starting at age cuts her risk of dying from breast cancer by percent compared to a percent reduction in risk if a woman followed the task force recommendations when they were issued the task force s guidelines contradicted years of messages about the need for routine breast cancer screening starting at age kicking off a fury of protest among breast cancer experts and advocacy groups who argued the recommendation of fewer screenings would confuse women and result in more deaths from breast cancer they were meant to spare women some of the worry and expense of extra tests needed to distinguish between cancer and harmless lumps but helvie and colleague edward hendrick of the university of colorado wrote that the uspstf chose to ignore the science available to them and overemphasized the potential harms of screening mammography to the serious detriment of u s women who follow their flawed recommendations dr carol lee who chairs the american college of radiology s breast imaging commission said the new study highlights the risk of setting policy based on the conclusions of one group of scientists she said breast mammograms have contributed significantly to reducing deaths from breast cancer a fact that should not be ignored in favor of mathematical models it s like a weather man using a computer model to see what the weather is rather than looking outside the window lee said in a telephone interview many groups including the american cancer society have stuck by their long standing recommendations of a yearly breast exam for women starting at age stressing that the breast x rays have been proven to save lives by spotting tumors early when they are most easily treated breast cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death among u s women after lung cancer it kills people globally every year and is diagnosed in close to million people around the world,0
london reuters british scientists have discovered a rogue gene which helps cancer spread around the body and say blocking it with the right kind of drugs could stop many types of the disease in their tracks a laboratory researcher in a file photo reuters file researchers from the university of east anglia said their findings could lead within a decade to the development of new medicines to halt a critical late stage of the disease known as metastasis when cancer cells spread to other parts of the body the culprit gene called wwp is an enzymic bonding agent found inside cancer cells the researchers explained in their study published in the journal oncogene monday it attacks and breaks down a naturally occurring protein in the body which normally prevents cancer cells from spreading in tests in the laboratory the uea team found that by blocking wwp levels of the natural inhibitor protein were boosted and the cancer cells remained dormant surinder soond who worked on the study said it was a novel and exciting approach to treating cancer and the spread of tumors which holds great potential the challenge now is to identify a potent drug that will get inside cancer cells and destroy the activity of the rogue gene said andrew chantry of uea s school of biological sciences who led the research he said this was a difficult but not impossible task and one that would be made easier by the better understanding of the biological processes gained in this early research chantry said in a telephone interview the findings mean drugs could be developed in the next years that could be used to halt the aggressive spread of many forms of cancer including breast cancer brain colon and skin cancer if a drug was developed that deactivated wwp he said conventional therapies such as chemotherapy and radiotherapy could be used on primary tumors with no risk of the disease taking hold elsewhere he said his team is now working with other scientists to try to design a drug which could interrupt the gene s activity,1
jan using electrical pulses to stimulate nerve centers deep within the brain may reduce high blood pressure that can t be controlled with medication a case report shows doctors in the u k made the discovery after implanting a device that works as an electric stimulator of a region of the brain in a year old man who had developed chronic pain on the left side of his body following a stroke though his pain eventually returned after four months his doctors report that their patient s previously uncontrolled blood pressure has remained normal for nearly three years that was a surprise because experts had long thought that pain had to be reduced to see a reduction in blood pressure pain creates stress and that can have an effect on one s blood pressure says nikunj j patel md a neurosurgeon at frenchay hospital in bristol u k and an author of the case study patel says that makes the impact of the case study startling and exciting because if studies bear the findings out deep brain stimulation may one day help people with hypertension whose blood pressure remains uncontrolled on multiple medications the case study is published in the jan issue of neurology while the case study is only an example of the phenomenon occurring in a single person previous reports have observed the same kinds of reductions in blood pressure in people getting deep brain stimulation for pain though researchers had believed that the blood pressure benefit was directly tied to the degree of pain relief the person experienced what their case report shows is that blood pressure can be reduced in a sustained fashion in a patient with unsuccessful deep brain stimulation for pain says erlick pereira md a neurosurgeon at the university of oxford pereira wrote about blood pressure reductions in a patient getting deep brain stimulation in the january issue of the journal of clinical neuroscience i think that s important because it paves the way for potentially studying patients without chronic pain and offering the treatment sometime in the future to reduce blood pressure he says,1
en español by maureen salamon healthday reporter monday jan healthday news doctors administering deep brain stimulation to control a patient s severe pain report that they discovered the treatment consistently lowered the man s hard to control high blood pressure the finding introduces the possibility that deep brain stimulation a surgical implant that delivers electrical pulses to the brain might one day become a treatment for drug resistant hypertension or lead to clues about the brain s role in regulating blood pressure the study is reported in the jan print issue of the journal neurology about percent of high blood pressure cases either can t be controlled with medication or patients cannot tolerate them study author dr nikunj k patel a neurosurgeon at frenchay hospital in bristol england said in a journal news release according to the u s centers for disease control and prevention high blood pressure affects percent of american adults the condition raises the risk of heart attack and stroke it s a really interesting paper said dr nicholas d schiff director of the laboratory of cognitive neuromodulation at new york presbyterian hospital weill cornell medical center i thought it was compelling though single cases are always questionable to generalize in the case study a year old man was implanted with a deep brain stimulator to treat severe pain stemming from a stroke although the patient was taking four drugs to control his high blood pressure which was diagnosed at the time of his stroke his blood pressure had remained high the man s blood pressure gradually decreased enough for him to stop taking all blood pressure medications though the deep brain stimulation failed to control his pain long term when researchers tested turning off the stimulator after two years the patient s blood pressure rose significantly the study adds to other recent research focused on neuromodulation which harnesses the power of electrical impulses in the body for therapeutic benefit tactics being tested include renal nerve ablation a procedure that emits low power radiofrequency along the nerves next to the kidneys interrupting signals that trigger high blood pressure in the general sense neuromodulation for blood pressure is really going to be a revolutionary treatment for chronic high blood pressure said cardiologist dr marc penn director of the cleveland clinic s bakken heart brain center i think it s really interesting physiology added penn noting that the results would need to be repeated multiple times before a therapy based on it could be developed schiff however was hesitant to predict that deep brain stimulation might become a common treatment for hard to control high blood pressure this is a case report and not a treatment for anything he said adding there are risks to this procedure and one has to really look at the tradeoffs more information for more information about deep brain stimulation visit the american association of neurological surgeons,1
images of the hindu goddess lakshmi often portray her carrying a coconut the symbolism has meant something to east indians for thousands of years and increasingly it resonates for westerners move over pomegranate and acai berry coconuts are the new in food touted by natural foods enthusiasts and chased by entrepreneurs looking for a big payday it s a good time to own a coconut farm that s for sure said daniel fabricant vice president for government and scientific affairs at the natural products association a trade association in washington fabricant said companies that belong to his organization representing natural foods retailers and manufacturers are increasingly offering coconut based products you ve got fiber fats and oils water based compounds and you ve got the milk he said it s a holistic approach the fruit s appeal rests in part on this versatility a single coconut produces water nectar flesh milk and even textile fiber that translates into a broad slate of products and in contrast to another natural substance that gets transformed into a wide variety of products petroleum coconuts are viewed as healthy but are they it depends coconut water comes from young green coconuts and contains a winning combination of electrolytes sodium and potassium it is very healthy it s an effective drink for rehydration that doesn t bring in the added sugars and the additives said dani little dietitian for the whole foods market on pearl street in boulder a lot of rehydrating beverages have additives whereas the coconut water it s super clean coconut oil and milk though are receiving mixed reviews the facts on fats coconut fat is saturated like the fat in lard and butter the healthiest fats those found in olive and canola oils contain more monounsaturated fats which do not raise ldl cholesterol and might even help lower it doctors and dietitians have warned people away from cholesterol boosting saturated fats for years coconut fats are not an exception i ve had clients who have added coconut oil to shakes and things like that and their cholesterol has gone up significantly said jessica crandall a denver dietitian who is president of the colorado dietetic association saturated fat clogs your arteries and is not good for heart health i was meeting with a cardiologist recently and he said he doesn t advise coconut oil for any clients the fat issue is complicated by the types of fatty acids found in coconut versus other saturated fats while most other saturated fats contain long chain fatty acids most coconut fats are medium chain this is advantageous for coconuts because the medium chain fatty acids are broken down more rapidly by enzymes said little in general she said fats high in medium chain fatty acids are more healthy than those laden with long chain acids in addition coconut fats are high in lauric acid which many believe acts as an antimicrobial helping prevent viruses fungi and parasites even so little a coconut enthusiast doesn t recommend loading up on coconut fats instead of buying oils or supplements just use the whole coconut what we tend to do with our food supply is take the positive and squeeze it into a pill or jar and think that will take care of everything she said if you focus on coconut oil you lose out on the fiber and you are focusing on a concentrated source of calories it s the whole coconut that needs to be talked about the coconut gold rush entrepreneurs are talking about the whole coconut these days some those toiling to make money with coconut water are worried about the coconut supply coconut water is much different from red bull or vitamin water said john craven the founder of bevnet com a trade publication for the beverage industry if they want to make more they just build more factories craven describes the race to turn coconut water into a big market like iced tea or energy drinks as something akin to a gold rush right now coconut water is all the rage he said with the natural movement being in the forefront right now the timing is right in the past couple of years a couple of brands have figured out the right angle electrolytes and hydration craven estimated the coconut water market at about million annually right now but companies are doubling their sales year after year by next year he said one company alone vita coco could do million or more in sales he predicted within a few years it will be a billion dollar market mammoth beverage companies like coca cola dr pepper snapple group and pepsico have investments in coconut water grocers shelves add new coconut water products regularly demand has increased exponentially primarily in mainstream groceries like walmart and costco said arthur gallego a spokesman for the new york based vita coco it s trickling down to the mass market the company is growing so quickly he said it had to hunt for coconuts from outside of brazil where it previously harvested most of its fruit now it also gets coconuts from asia the volume is going through the roof said laura sauls a spokeswoman for hermosa beach calif based zico we are seeing new competitors by the week it s not just the pure water that is exciting marketers it s increasingly being used as an additive too coconut water is very healthy and that s our aim said kevin conrad a sales executive with gofast a denver energy drink that now includes a version containing coconut water concentrate it s healthy and simple too that s one of the attractions said tom rich who is in charge of grocery operations for whole foods rocky mountain region it s something you don t have to figure out he said people know what it is and where it grows it s simple all the way around douglas brown or coconut by the numbers one tablespoon of coconut oil contains calories and grams of fat grams of which is saturated a tablespoon of butter by comparison contains calories and grams of fat of those grams are saturated coconut milk doesn t pack quite the wallop of oil but consume it in moderation a quarter cup has calories and grams of fat with grams of the fat saturated one cup of coconut water contains calories a half gram of fat milligrams of sodium and grams of carbohydrates,0
en español by dennis thompson healthday reporter friday jan healthday news americans suffering from muscle pain are used to taking a pill or rubbing in a cream to help soothe their aches but a new form of pain relief seems to be catching on analgesics delivered through a medicated patch placed directly where it hurts the u s food and drug administration approved the country s first over the counter pain relieving transdermal patches in but the patches marketed under the brand name salonpas are nothing new they ve been sold in various countries in asia since the s according to their manufacturer the japanese firm hisamitsu pharmaceutical salonpas is the western world catching up with asia said dr rick rosenquist a professor of anesthesia and director of pain medicine at the university of iowa carver college of medicine and chairman of the american society of anesthesiologists committee on pain medicine if you are an asian kid you ve had these placed on you since time immemorial he said it s just now starting to hit more mainstream in the united states they re gaining more acceptance before the fda action pain relieving patches were available in the united states only by prescription said dr john dombrowski director of the washington pain center in washington d c their active ingredients include such medications as lidocaine capsaicin and non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs or nsaids the active ingredients in salonpas are methyl salicylate and menthol common components of pain relieving gels and creams such as bengay pain patches have a number of benefits rosenquist and dombrowski said not the least of which is convenience with a patch you put it on and forget about it rather than having to remember to take pills dombrowski said the patches also deliver their medicine directly to the site of a person s pain this may eliminate some of the side effects that come with taking pills for instance some analgesics are likely to cause an upset stomach unless they re taken with food obviously patches get around that he said it s a very clever way of getting the medications right where they need to be and because patches release their medication slowly into the body through the skin people also should get more consistent pain relief than they do with pills on the other hand people have to be sure to carefully follow instructions for using the patches to avoid overdose the main downside to pain patches however apparently comes from their effect on the skin some people may find themselves allergic to either the active ingredient in a patch or the adhesive used to keep the patch on the body you need to pay attention when you put them on to see if you have any kind of skin reaction to the compounds that are contained in the patch rosenquist said both doctors said that they expect more over the counter pain patches to hit the market if the popularity of salonpas continues to grow future over the counter options they predicted could include reduced dosage versions of the nsaid delivering patches now available through prescription success begets success dombrowski said if this does very well other drug companies will say i want a piece of this action more information the u s national institute of neurological disorders and stroke has more about pain,1
tired depressed forgetting things who isn t these days those are also symptoms of a deficiency of b a key nutrient needed to make red blood cells and dna and keep the nervous system working right vitamin b deficiency is officially considered rare affecting about in americans according to a study but the incidence rises with age to about of elderly people the rate is also much higher among people who don t eat meat or dairy products people with absorption problems people taking acid blocking medications and those with type diabetes who take the drug metformin b deficiency is much more common than the textbooks and journal articles say it is says alan pocinki an internist in washington d c who routinely tests his patients who fall into those categories he also notes that since the metformin connection was discovered only recently some physicians aren t aware of it they assume that if patients complain of numbness and tingling in the feet it s a diabetes issue and not a b issue other symptoms of low b include anemia depression dementia confusion loss of appetite and balance problems long term deficiency can bring severe anemia nerve damage and neurological changes that may be irreversible just three ounces of clams breaded and fried have about of the daily allowance getty images sometimes the symptoms are subtle internist linda assatourians one of dr pocinki s partners says that a surprising number of her young female patients also have low levels of b typically they are healthy and active but they don t eat much meat and they have minor mood memory or balance problems when i supplement their b they feel better dr assatourians says it s not a controlled study but i see a lot of them i was sort of tired but i thought it s winter and i m doing too much says jessica riester editor of publications for a german american think tank her b level was slightly over picograms per milliliter the normal range is considered to pg per ml after several weeks of b injections then milligrams daily in pill form her b is now over pg per ml and she says she feels better my color is better and the shadows under my eyes are gone she says indeed several studies have shown that some symptoms of b deficiency particularly early problems with cognitive function can be apparent even when patients blood levels are still in the normal range how much recommended dietary allowances for vitamin b by age months nanograms months ng years ng years micrograms years mcg years and older mcg pregnant women mcg nursing mothers mcg source national academy of sciences still vitamin b isn t a miracle pick me up a performance enhancer a weight loss aid or a quick way to sober up after a long night of drinking as some celebrities and internet marketers claim for people who aren t deficient there s no evidence whatsoever that these injections are useful to pep you up says irwin h rosenberg a professor and former dean of the friedman school of nutrition at tufts university taking too much b is unlikely to be harmful he adds the excess is simply excreted b is one of the newest of the human vitamins identified in it originates in bacteria yeast and microbes in soil plants can t store it so people get their b almost exclusively from meat liver poultry fish and dairy products adults need just micrograms a day the amount in three ounces of beef and can generally store it in fat tissue for several years dr pocinki speculates that some of his very lean patients are b deficient because they don t have much fat to store it in some people have trouble absorbing b in the first place stomach acid is needed to release it from food particles people who have used acid blocking medications particularly proton pump inhibitors for years may not have enough and many elderly people naturally stop making stomach acid so b deficiencies are increasingly common as people age boosting b b comes almost exclusively from meat liver poultry fish and dairy products some breakfast cereals are also fortified with the vitamin selected food sources of vitamin b food micrograms mcg per serving percent dv liver beef braised slice clams cooked breaded and fried ounces breakfast cereals fortified with of the dv for vitamin b serving trout rainbow wild cooked ounces salmon sockeye cooked ounces trout rainbow farmed cooked ounces beef top sirloin broiled ounces cheeseburger double patty and bun sandwich breakfast cereals fortified with of the dv for vitamin b serving yogurt plain cup haddock cooked ounces tuna white ounces milk cup cheese swiss ounce beef taco taco ham cured roasted ounces egg large whole chicken roasted ½ breast that s why the institute of medicine recommends that people over age get most of their daily requirement from b supplements or cereals fortified with the vitamin that break down more easily in the digestive tract further down the digestive tract b must combine with a protein called intrinsic factor to be absorbed into the body without intrinsic factor people absorb much less b resulting in a condition called pernicious anemia in which red blood cells don t develop properly left untreated pernicious anemia can bring on neurological changes delusions and hallucinations the discovery that eating large amounts of liver could cure pernicious anemia led to the nobel prize for medicine in other conditions can also interfere with b absorption including celiac disease and crohn s disease i thought i was going to die in my sleep because i had so little energy says ellen icochea a senior executive at the federal bureau of investigation who had a very low b level along with several major medical problems weekly b injections made a dramatic difference it was like wow here s energy she says david h johnson a year old wildlife biologist takes b shots every three days to cope with the challenges of chronic fatigue syndrome imagine you are on a small roller coaster he says you feel up one day and the next and then you start slumping until you re really flat again b comes in pill form and a new nasal spray but injections are the fastest way to correct a severe deficiency since it does not need to be absorbed in the digestive tract many patients learn to inject themselves or have a spouse do it to cut down on doctor visits i have world travelers who take their b and needles with them it s like traveling with insulin says dr pocinki he says he has seen low grade depression lift when patients were given b supplements researchers are still investigating possible links between long term b deficiency and other health problems it s known for example that b and the other b vitamins help reduce homocysteine an amino acid in the bloodstream that may be associated with heart disease but several large prospective studies have not shown that taking b supplements reduces the risk it s also not clear whether low b raises the risk of dementia and alzheimer s disease although cognitive impairment brought on by low b is sometimes mistaken for alzheimer s it s really easy to miss and really easy to fix says dr pocinki an additional concern a high level of folic acid can mask symptoms of b deficiency and many people are getting more folic acid than they realize since all enriched flour must contain folic acid to reduce the risk of neural tube defects a severe malformation that occurs in developing fetuses some studies suggest that having high folic acid can make cognitive damage from low b even worse to this day we are concerned about the trade off says dr rosenberg who was on the advisory panel that recommended enriching flour write to melinda beck at,1
we have found many of the same results said dr hamill professor of kinesiology and the director of the university s biomechanics laboratory i guess the main thing to note is that as biomechanists we really do not know how orthotics work orthotists say dr nigg s sweeping statement does not take into account the benefits their patients perceive the key measure of success said jeffrey p wensman director of clinical and technical services at the orthotics and prosthetics center at the university of michigan is that patients feel better the vast majority of our patients are happier having them than not he said about orthotics that are inserted in shoes seamus kennedy president and co owner of hersco ortho labs in new york said there was an abundance of evidence hundreds of published papers that orthotics can treat and prevent mechanically induced foot problems leading to common injuries like knee pain shinsplints and pain along the bottom of the foot orthotics do work mr kennedy said but choosing the right one requires a great deal of care yet scott d cummings president of the american academy of orthotists and prosthetists says the trade is only now moving toward becoming a science so far most of the focus in that direction has been on rigorously assessing orthotics and prosthetics for other conditions like scoliosis with less work on shoe orthotics for otherwise healthy athletes advertisement continue reading the main story anecdotally we know what designs work and what designs don t work for foot orthotics said mr cummings who is an orthotist and prosthetist at next step in manchester n h but when it comes to science and rigorous studies he added comparatively there isn t a whole lot of evidence out there dr nigg would agree in his studies he found there was no way to predict the effect of a given orthotic consider for example an insert that pushes the foot away from a pronated position or rotated excessively outward you might think it would have the same effect on everyone who pronates but it does not one person might respond by increasing the stress on the outside of the foot another on the inside another might not respond at all unconsciously correcting the orthotic s correction that s the first problem we have dr nigg said if you do something to a shoe different people will react differently the next problem is that there may be little agreement among orthotics makers about what sort of insert to prescribe in one study discussed in his new book biomechanics of sport shoes dr nigg sent a talented distance runner to five certified orthotics makers each made a different type of insert to correct his pronation the athlete wore each set of orthotics for three days and then ran kilometers about miles he liked two of the orthotics and ran faster with them than with the other three but the construction of the two he liked was completely different newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you re not a robot

again later view all new york times newsletters then what dr nigg asked in series of studies do orthotics actually do they turn out to have little effect on kinematics the actual movement of the skeleton during a run but they can have large effects on muscles and joints often making muscles work as much as percent harder for the same movement and increasing stress on joints by a similar amount as for corrective orthotics he says they do not correct so much as lead to a reduction in muscle strength advertisement continue reading the main story in one recent review of published papers dr nigg and his colleagues analyzed studies on orthotics and injury prevention nearly all published studies they report lacked scientific rigor for example they did not include groups that for comparison did not receive orthotics or they discounted people who dropped out of the study even though dropouts are often those who are not benefiting from a treatment being generous about studies with design flaws that could overstate effects dr nigg and his colleagues concluded that custom made orthotics could help prevent and treat plantar fasciitis a common injury to a tendon at the bottom of the foot and stress fractures of the tibia along the shin they added though that the research was inadequate for them to have confidence in those conclusions dr nigg also did his own study with canadian soldiers half of them got inserts and the others for comparison did not those who got inserts had a choice of six different types that did different things to foot positioning each man chose the insert he found most comfortable and wore it for four months the men selected five of the six inserts with equal frequency the findings were somewhat puzzling while the group that used inserts had about half as many injuries defined as pain that kept them from exercising for at least half a day there was no obvious relation between the insert a soldier chose and his biomechanics without it that s why dr nigg says for now it is difficult to figure out which orthotic will help an individual the only indication seems to be that a comfortable orthotic might be better than none at all at least for the activities of people in the military so where does this leave people like jason stallman my friend and colleague at the new york times jason has perfectly flat feet no arch he got his first pair of orthotics at or and has worn orthotics all the time for walking and running ever since about a year ago he decided to try going without them in his everyday life he still wears them when he runs every medical specialist jason has seen tried to correct his flat feet but with little agreement on how to do it advertisement continue reading the main story every new podiatrist or orthopedist he told me would invariably look at his orthotics and say oh these aren t any good the lab i use makes much better ones your injury is probably linked to these poor fitting orthotics so he tried different orthotic styles different materials different orthotics labs with every new doctor that is a typical story dr nigg says in fact he adds there is no need to correct a flat foot all jason needs to do is strengthen his foot and ankle muscles and then try running without orthotics dr nigg says he always wondered what was wrong with having flat feet arches he explains are an evolutionary remnant needed by primates that gripped trees with their feet since we don t do that anymore we don t really need an arch he wrote in an e mail why would we for landing no need for the stance phase no need for the takeoff phase no need thus a flat foot is not something that is bad per se so why shouldn t jason or anyone for that matter just go to a store and buy whatever shoe feels good without worrying about correcting a perceived biomechanical defect that is exactly what you should do dr nigg replied,1
cnn taking dietary supplements containing essential fatty acids can help reduce the symptoms of premenstrual syndrome according to the results of study by researchers at a brazilian university the study published monday in the journal reproductive health found that taking capsules containing about gram of a blend of three essential fatty acids produced a significant reduction in pms symptoms essential fatty acids are substances that are not produced by the human body and are only available from diet eggs nuts vegetable oils and fish are examples of foods that provide such acids which are also available in supplement form the study authored by researchers from the federal university of pernambuco is not the first to address the possible link between pms and essential fatty acids substances that play a complicated role in a woman s reproductive system the study cites research dating back to examining such a possible link according to the study the women who participated reported few side effects and most of those were mild and may have been due to sensitivity to mineral oil the placebo taken by some of the participants the supplements taken by women in the study contained mg of gamma linolenic acid mg of oleic acid mg of linoleic acid mg of other polyunsaturated acids and mg of vitamin e according to researchers according to the study women who took the supplements for six months saw a bigger benefit than those who took them for three months the researchers do not make any recommendation in their study about whether women who suffer from pms should increase their intake of essential fatty acids or instead consult with their doctor other treatments studied for pms include vitamin b ascorbic acid and niacin,1
antidepressants relieve hot flashes by rob stein an antidepressant can help alleviate hot flashes that plague many menopausal women according to new federally funded research a study involving women found those taking the antidepressant lexapro experienced a percent reduction in number of hot flashes they were experiencing and the hot flashes they did have tended to be less severe researchers reported in the journal of the american medical association for years many women took hormones to alleviate hots flashes but hormone use plummeted after the federal government s massive women s health initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits since then many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors ssris and snris might be effective in the new study ellen freeman of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine in philadelphia and colleagues gave women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks when the study started the women were having an average of nearly hot flashes each day the number of hot flashes among the women taking lexapro which is also known as escitalopram dropped to about five on average after eight weeks a percent decrease or about fewer hot flashes per day the researchers reported the severity of the hot flashes also decreased among those taking a placebo the number of hot flashes dropped to per day a percent decrease of fewer hot flashes per day lexapro seemed to work even among women who were not anxious or depressed the hot flashes increased after the women stopped taking the drug but not among those taking a placebo although the benefit was modest it appeared to be significant enough that women might consider trying it the researchers said the study is the first to examine whether there are any racial differences in how well an antidepressant works in alleviating hot flashes african american women are more likely than white women to report hot flashes the study found none,1
studies show that for kids ear infections antibiotics work better than waiting by jennifer larue huget being a parent these days sometimes entails this hypocrisy yes i know overuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that may soon conquer the universe but please give some to my kid anyway now two new studies bolstered by an accompanying editorial in the new england journal of medicine demonstrate what we parents have suspected for years when it comes to ear infections antibiotics are in order current practice guidelines for treating kids mild middle ear infections or acute otitis media call for watchful waiting to be followed by antibiotics only if symptoms worsen or don t cease that sounds fine in theory but it s a tough pill to swallow when it s your own wee one who s wailing and writhing in pain ear infections hurt and waiting for them to run their course can be excruciating both of the studies in contrast to earlier research on which the watchful waiting approach has been based are considered well designed even if they are on the small side both show that antibiotics are more effective than placebos in relieving ear infection symptoms such as fever poor appetite decreased activity and irritability and suggested that their benefits warrant their being administered early on regardless of the seeming severity of a child s symptoms interestingly antibiotics were no more effective at reducing pain as reported by parents or children than placebos one of the studies noted that while antibiotics specifically amoxicillin paired with clavulanate shortened the duration of symptoms half the children on placebo eventually got better without the aid of those drugs still some of the placebo group kids required rescue treatment when their symptoms grew markedly worse the studies also noted that the use of antibiotics must be weighed against the risk of antimicrobial resistance to which prescriptions for childhood maladies such as ear infections are thought to contribute mightily and against antibiotics side effects which can include diarrhea and eczema as it happens on christmas eve my daughter who at is wee no more woke up with a wicked pain in her ear her doctor took one quick look inside and wrote a prescription for augmentin a popular drug that combines amoxicillin with clavulanate potassium by christmas morning the pain had subsided did i feel guilty for potentially contributing to the development of a superbug the thought never crossed my mind it doesn t tend to when you re worried about your kid and grateful when her pain goes away,0

by alan mozes healthday reporter tuesday dec healthday news the recreational drug known as ecstasy may have a medicinal role to play in helping people who have trouble connecting to others socially new research suggests in a study involving a small group of healthy people investigators found that the drug also known as mdma prompted heightened feelings of friendliness playfulness and love and induced a lowering of the guard that might have therapeutic uses for improving social interactions yet the closeness it sparks might not be result in deep and lasting connections the findings suggest that mdma enhances sociability but does not necessarily increase empathy noted study author gillinder bedi an assistant professor of clinical psychology at columbia university and a research scientist at the new york state psychiatric institute in new york city the study funded by the u s national institute on drug abuse and conducted at the human behavioral pharmacology laboratory at the university of chicago was published in the dec issue of biological psychiatry in july another study reported that mdma might be useful in treating post traumatic stress disorder ptsd based on the drug s apparent boosting of the ability to cope with grief by helping to control fears without numbing people emotionally mdma is part of a family of so called club drugs which are popular with some teens and young at all night dances or raves these drugs which are often used in combination with alcohol have potentially life threatening effects according to the u s national institute on drug abuse the newest study explored the effects of mdma on healthy volunteers nine women and men aged to all said they had taken mdma for recreational purposes at least twice in their lives they were randomly assigned to take either a low or moderate dose of mdma methamphetamine or a sugar pill during four sessions in about a three week period each session lasted at least hours or until all effects of the drug had worn off during that time participants stayed in a laboratory testing room and social interaction was limited to contact with a research assistant who helped administer cognitive exams a moderate dose of mdma was found to significantly increase feelings of loving friendliness and playfulness the researchers said whereas the low dose of mdma boosted feelings of loneliness the moderate dose also prompted a drop in the ability to accurately recognize fear in other people s faces determined by having the participants look at a range of photos the study found but it did not affect the ability to perceive the shifting cues in a person s eyes or voice determined by having the participants listen to a series of audio clips this effect the bedi and his team suggested could help people improve their social skills by shielding them from the negative emotions of others in a twist the researchers also found that methamphetamine similarly prompted feelings of friendliness and loving in fact those who took the drug actually rated themselves as more sociable than those taking mdma as a warning the researchers noted that mdma might indeed facilitate socializing but it also might impair a person s perceptive abilities and thus prompt risk taking nonetheless the researchers suggested that mdma might help people with ptsd as well those with autism schizophrenia or antisocial personality disorder cope with a variety of emotional difficulties more controlled research is needed to establish whether mdma can safely and effectively add to psychotherapy for some conditions and if so what the mechanisms of these effects are bedi said dr michael mithoefer author of the earlier study on mdma and ptsd also urged further exploration of the medicinal potential of the drug first i think it s very important that we investigate potential new therapies and that we shouldn t be dissuaded from doing that just because something can be misused he said many things can be life threatening or dangerous if used incorrectly but if used in the right setting wisely many things can also be helpful so there s no question we should be looking into how this might benefit people who are suffering the results of his earlier study which had focused on the moderate dose of mdma were very promising mithoefer said now there s a long way to go between that and proving effectiveness but it certainly suggests just as these findings suggest that the question merits further investigation more information the u s national institute on drug abuse has more on mdma,0

varicose veins are one of the more unsightly signs of aging but new less invasive treatments are making it easier to remove them painlessly bypassing a difficult surgical procedure that was often the only option in the past as many as of women and of men suffer from varicose veins over the age of one out of two people are affected heredity plays a part but obesity prolonged standing on the job and hormone therapy increase the risks sometimes varicose veins have no signs or symptoms and require no treatment though doctors may recommend wearing compression stockings and elevating the legs exercise can also help relieve pain but often varicose veins can be disabling and dangerous as well as a warning sign of more serious problems in the circulatory system while vein problems aren t related to artery problems such as those that can cause heart disease serious complications of varicose veins can include deep vein thrombosis a blood clot that can travel to the lungs and cause death and venous ulcers shallow wounds that develop on the lower leg and can be hard to heal veins near the surface of the skin can also rupture and bleed heavily valve trouble normally the heart pumps blood filled with nutrients and oxygen to the entire body through the arteries and then veins carry the blood from the body back up to the heart the exact cause of varicose veins isn t known but they develop when one way valves in the veins that prevent blood from flowing backward stop working properly so blood pools in the superficial veins under the surface of the skin and causes them to get larger and less elastic darren schneider director of the center for vascular and endovascular surgery at new york presbyterian hospital weill cornell medical center says determining the right treatment depends in large part on the size and location of the veins patients typically need an ultrasound study to see if there are any blood clots in the deeper vein system and to assess the function of the valves smaller veins can often be treated with sclerotherapy which involves injecting a chemical solution into the vein to destroy it and costs to per treatment for larger veins doctors may recommend endovascular procedures which range in price from to these involve threading a catheter into the vein and directing a heat source such as a laser or radio frequency device into the vein to incinerate it vein procedures are offered by a range of physicians including vascular surgeons dermatologists and cardiologists dr schneider trained as both a vascular surgeon and an interventional radiologist suggests that patients ask if a doctor is board certified in a vascular specialty or what specialized training the doctor has received in vein therapy the old way in a procedure that dates to the th century varicose veins can be removed by stripping pulling them out with a wire threaded in through an incision the surgery can cause bleeding bruising nerve injuries scarring and infection and legs may have to be wrapped with bandages for several weeks while some veins may still require stripping surgery most can be treated with less invasive therapies last summer the food and drug administration approved an injectable drug for sclerotherapy that has been widely used in europe for years polidocanol sold under the brand name asclera for use in the tiniest varicose veins known as spider veins and for so called reticular veins that are one to three millimeters in diameter the drug has a strong safety record and it also has anesthetic properties which makes treatments more comfortable for patients according to suman rathbun director of the vascular medicine program at the university of oklahoma health sciences center in oklahoma city although asclera isn t approved to treat large veins dr rathbun and others are using it off label for that purpose converting the liquid into a foam when injected dr rathbun says it fills the vein better than the liquid which sometimes leaks out making it less effective laser procedures studies have shown that minimally invasive endovenous laser procedures that use local anesthesia are highly effective for removing the so called saphenous veins a large one that runs from the foot to the thigh and a smaller one up the back of the leg behind the knee and have a high rate of success over time nancy neukam says she decided to try the procedure because the bulging blue varicose veins in her lower left leg were increasingly unsightly and painful though she feared treatment would be painful and difficult ms neukam took half a valium and slept feeling nothing as baltimore dermatologist robert weiss guided a catheter and laser tip into the vein to seal it closed in minutes ms neukam had to wear compression stockings for three days afterward and had some bruising but now she says i play golf and don t mind wearing a skirt or bermuda shorts anymore and my legs look and feel wonderful ms landro

by alan mozes healthday reporter monday dec healthday news acupuncture may be an effective way to treat older children struggling with a certain form of lazy eye new research from china suggests although experts say more studies are needed lazy eye amblyopia is essentially a state of miscommunication between the brain and the eyes resulting in the favoring of one eye over the other according to the national eye institute the study authors noted that anywhere from less than percent to percent of people worldwide are affected with the condition of those between one third and one half have a type of lazy eye known as anisometropia which is caused by a difference in the degree of nearsightedness or farsightedness between the two eyes standard treatment for children involves eyeglasses or contact lens designed to correct focus issues however while this approach is often successful in younger children between the ages of and it is successful among only about a third of older children between the ages of and for the latter group doctors will often place a patch over the good eye temporarily in addition to eyeglasses and treatment success is typically achieved in two thirds of cases children however often have trouble adhering to patch therapy the treatment can bring emotional issues for some and a reverse form of lazy eye can also take root the researchers said study author dr dennis s c lam from the department of ophthalmology and visual sciences and institute of chinese medicine at the joint shantou international eye center of shantou university and chinese university of hong kong and his colleagues report their observations in the december issue of the archives of ophthalmology in the search for a better option than patch therapy lam and his associates set out to explore the potential benefits of acupuncture noting that it has been used to treat dry eye and myopia between and lam and his colleagues recruited children between the ages of and who had been diagnosed with anisometropia about half the children were treated five times a week with acupuncture targeting five specific acupuncture needle insertion points located at the top of the head and the eyebrow region as well as the legs and hands the other half were given two hours a day of patch therapy combined with a minimum of one hour per day of near vision exercises such as reading after about four months of treatment the research team found that overall visual acuity improved markedly more among the acupuncture group relative to the patch group in fact they noted that while lazy eye was successfully treated in nearly percent of the acupuncture patients that figure dropped to less than percent among the patch patients neither treatment prompted significant side effects the authors said the team nonetheless pointed out that their study s tracking period was relatively short and that acupuncture is a complicated system that may lend itself to different success rates depending on the skills of the particular acupuncturist and while theorizing that the apparent success of this alternative approach may have something to do with stimulating blood flow retinal nerve growth and visual cortex activity the authors acknowledged that the exact mechanism by which it works remains poorly understood dr richard bensinger a seattle based ophthalmologist and spokesman for the american academy of ophthalmology said that the finding is certainly suggestive and worth following up this is kind of cool he said but i will say that i don t know of any study looking at acupuncture and vision there are studies based on symptomatic things such as pain and i think there s pretty good evidence that it does have benefit in that respect but for vision therapy this is the first i ve heard of it and i don t know that anyone has ever tried this before so this is like a teaser of course people in those parts of the country like where i live where there s fairly wide acceptance of alternative medicine might receive this type of treatment better than others bensinger cautioned and no question patients will gravitate towards treatments that are covered by their insurance even if it s not the best treatment and as an alternative approach this may not be covered but if it works he added people will certainly be excited although it certainly needs further testing and further studies to decide if it s really beneficial or not for his part dr stanley chang chairman of the ophthalmology department at columbia university in new york city did not seem to hold out much promise for acupuncture s potential as an alternative lazy eye therapy acupuncture i think definitely works for pain amelioration but i m not sure it works for some of these other things he cautioned they ve tried it for the treatment of myopia and glaucoma without much success and so although there haven t been any really good trials comparing acupuncture with conventional therapies my guess is that it s probably not going to do much for the treatment of lazy eye however i think it s worth considering or trying chang added because nothing else seems to work very well for patients of that age including patch therapy but what will need is a very carefully controlled study that accounts for all the variables that might have an impact on the outcome of this approach more information for more on

many americans take aspirin to lower their risk of heart disease but a new study suggests a remarkable added benefit reporting that patients who took aspirin regularly for a period of several years were percent less likely decades later to die of solid tumor cancers including cancers of the stomach esophagus and lung as part of the new study published online monday in the journal lancet researchers examined the cancer death rates of patients who had participated in eight different randomized controlled trials of aspirin that ended up to years earlier participants who had been assigned to the aspirin arms of the studies were percent less likely after years to have died of solid tumor cancers than those who had been in the comparison group taking dummy pills during the clinical trials and their risk of gastrointestinal cancer death was percent lower the risk of lung cancer death was percent lower the risk of colorectal cancer death was percent lower and the risk of esophageal cancer death was percent lower the study reported the specific dose of aspirin taken did not seem to matter most trials gave out low doses of to milligrams but the participants in the longest lasting trials had the most drastic reductions in cancer death years later advertisement continue reading the main story this is important as a proof of principle that a single simple compound like aspirin can reduce the risk of cancer substantially said the study s lead author dr peter m rothwell professor of neurology at the university of oxford there s been a lot of work over the years showing that certain compounds can increase the risk of cancer but it s not been shown before that we can reduce the risk with something as simple as aspirin,1
dec taking aspirin over a long period of time can substantially cut the risk of dying from a variety of cancers according to a study showing that the benefit is independent of dose gender or smoking it also found that the protective effect increases with age the study is by peter rothwell md phd frcp of john radcliffe hospital in oxford england and colleagues and has been published online by the journal the lancet a previous study by the same authors showed that low doses of aspirin milligrams reduced the number of cases of colorectal cancer by a quarter and deaths caused by the disease by more than a third the latest study confirms the earlier results and concludes that similar effects can be shown for other types of cancers new aspirin cancer findings the study looked at eight trials examining the effects of a daily dose of aspirin on preventing heart attacks involving patients of whom died from cancer they showed a reduction in the number of deaths caused by cancer among those who had taken aspirin compared with people who had not the investigation also showed that the benefits of taking aspirin increased over time after five years death rates were shown to fall by for all cancers and by for gastrointestinal cancers participants were also followed up after years by which point of the original participants had died as a direct result of cancer this year follow up established that the risk of cancer death remained lower among those who had been allocated aspirin than those in the control group for all solid cancers including lung prostate brain bladder and kidney cancers and by for gastrointestinal cancers the fall in the risk of death broke down according to individual types of cancer esophageal cancer colorectal cancer lung cancer prostate cancer reductions in pancreatic stomach and brain cancers were difficult to quantify because of smaller numbers of deaths the authors say,1
en español monday dec healthday news long term use of a daily low dose aspirin dramatically cuts the risk of dying from a wide array of cancers a new investigation reveals specifically a british research team unearthed evidence that a low dose aspirin milligrams taken daily for at least five years brings about a percent to percent drop in fatalities depending on the type of cancer the finding stems from a fresh analysis of eight studies involving more than patients which had originally been conducted to examine the protective potential of a low dose aspirin regimen on cardiovascular disease the current observations follow prior research conducted by the same study team which reported in october that a long term regimen of low dose aspirin appears to shave the risk of dying from colorectal cancer by a third these findings provide the first proof in man that aspirin reduces deaths due to several common cancers the study team noted in a news release but the study s lead author prof peter rothwell from john radcliffe hospital and the university of oxford stressed that these results do not mean that all adults should immediately start taking aspirin they do demonstrate major new benefits that have not previously been factored into guideline recommendations he added noting that previous guidelines have rightly cautioned that in healthy middle aged people the small risk of bleeding on aspirin partly offsets the benefit from prevention of strokes and heart attacks but the reductions in deaths due to several common cancers will now alter this balance for many people rothwell suggested rothwell and his colleagues published their findings dec in the online edition of the lancet the research involved in the current review had been conducted for an average period of four to eight years the patients some of whom had been given a low dose aspirin regimen while others were not were tracked for up to years after the authors determined that while the studies were still underway overall cancer death risk plummeted by percent among those taking low dose aspirin but the long term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended at five years out death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by percent among those patients taking low dose aspirin the protective impact of low dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until years out and for prostate cancer the benefits first appeared years down the road twenty years after first beginning a low dose aspirin program death risk dropped by percent among prostate cancer patients percent among lung cancer patients although only those with adenocarcinomas the type typically seen in nonsmokers percent among colorectal cancer patients and percent among esophageal cancer patients the potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge the authors noted due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases they also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit and while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low dose aspirin age definitely did the year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients and while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this proof of principle the authors suggested that people who embark on a long term low dose aspirin regimen in their late s and s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most dr alan arslan an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at nyu langone medical center in new york city described the findings as very significant this is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers especially gastrointestinal cancers he noted the take home message for patients is that if someone is taking low dose or regular aspirin it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer arslan added however if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting aspirin has risks of side effects including bleeding and stroke more information for more on aspirin visit the national institutes of health,1

there s really no precedent for another drug that does this said dr matthew r smith a prostate cancer specialist at the massachusetts general hospital also bone scans actually measure bone formation not the presence of cancer itself so it cannot be completely ruled out that xl somehow stopped bone growth without killing the cancer however dr smith said he doubted that was the case because there were signs the drug also controlled tumors outside the bones drugs now used to treat advanced prostate cancer like taxotere do not have much affect on bone scans dr smith said bone drugs like zometa from novartis and denosumab from amgen can protect cancerous bones from fractures but have not been shown to fight the cancer itself another investigator in the trial dr david c smith of the university of michigan said he could not believe it when the bone scan of one patient who previously had widespread cancer in his bones came back completely clean i thought they had scanned the wrong

an investor in dendreon whose grandfather died of prostate cancer told the medicare coverage advisory committee on wednesday dr louis jacques director of the coverage and analysis group at the centers for medicare and medicaid services said cost was not a factor and that the agency had reviewed products approved by the f d a in the past dr jacques said he ordered the review after being contacted by federal lawmakers questioning why their constituents could not get the drug he realized that reimbursement by regional medicare contractors was inconsistent so he decided the agency should have a uniform national policy the medicare coverage advisory committee which met in baltimore did not discuss the cost of provenge or make a coverage recommendation it reviewed the clinical trial data and then rated the strength of the data on a scale of to the voting members mainly doctors and health policy experts averaged on the question of how much confidence they had that there was adequate evidence to conclude that provenge significantly prolongs survival that is between which is intermediate confidence and which is high confidence but some analysts said that should be enough for reimbursement trading in dendreon shares halted during regular market hours rose percent after hours however the panel gave very low scores to evidence that the drug would help prostate cancer

people who can t control cholesterol with diet exercise and statin drugs could soon have a new option according to a new study a medication ancetrapib appears to simultaneously raise the level of hdl sometimes called good cholesterol and to lower the level of ldl or bad cholesterol hdl cholesterol is not fully understood but essentially sucks cholesterol out of cells to be flushed from the body through the liver the study was sponsored by merck the drug s manufacturer it was published in the new england journal of medicine and results were to be presented wednesday at a meeting of american heart association in chicago the so called define trial involved patients with coronary heart disease or at high risk for it all were taking statins to lower ldl cholesterol roughly half also received ancetrapib while half got a placebo on average within weeks patients getting ancetrapib saw ldl levels drop by nearly percent compared with the placebo group while their hdl levels rose by percent there were no significant side effects if the same benefit were seen in all patients at risk of heart disease far from a sure thing it would translate to hundreds of thousands of fewer deaths and heart attacks over a five year period according to dr christopher cannon the lead study author and a cardiologist at brigham and women s hospital in boston it s an amazing result said dr robert eckel of the university of colorado a past president of the american heart association it s like a rocket that landed on jupiter rather than the moon still eckel warned it s too soon to say whether ancetrapib would actually prevent disease over the long run there s ample reason for caution a similar medication torcetrapib was considered promising four years ago but was shelved by pfizer after studies found it actually raised blood pressure and the risk of heart problems and death dr pk shah cardiologist at the cedars sinai heart institute said that he s encouraged by define but that some of the details give him pause it appears to be safe and to not raise blood pressure shah told cnn but it s not a slam dunk for one thing despite improved cholesterol levels patients did not see less inflammation in their blood vessels inflammation is a sign of damage from cholesterol to try to provide final answers merck is launching a study called reveal to follow people in several countries over four years the first patients will be enrolled in april according to dr rory collins of oxford university where the research will be overseen lee davies a merck spokesman said the company is not likely to seek fda approval until those results are in most likely in by then results will also be in on a large study of a similar drug dalcetrapib made by merck s competitor roche,1
en español by amanda gardner healthday reporter tuesday nov healthday news by substituting a healthy gene for a defective one scientists were able to partially restore the heart s ability to pump in heart failure patients researchers report this is the first time gene therapy has been tested and shown to improve outcomes for patients with advanced heart failure study lead author dr donna mancini professor of medicine and the sudhir choudhrie professor of cardiology at columbia university college of physicians and surgeons in new york city said in a university news release the therapy works by replenishing levels of an enzyme necessary for the heart to pump more efficiently by introducing the gene for serca a which is depressed in these patients if these results are confirmed in future trials this approach could be an alternative to heart transplant for patients without any other options she added mancini presented the results monday at the annual meeting of the american heart association aha in chicago the gene for serca a raises levels of the enzyme back to where the heart can pump more efficiently the enzyme regulates calcium cycling which in turn is involved in how well the heart contracts the researchers said heart failure is a defect in contractility related to calcium cycling explained dr robert eckel past president of the aha and professor of medicine at the university of colorado denver the study authors hope that if replicated in larger trials the gene therapy treatment could actually delay or obviate the need for heart transplants in patients with heart failure there are a lot of treatments for heart failure but at some point patients stop responding and then the prognosis is poor said dr rita redberg aha spokeswoman and professor of medicine at the university of california san francisco after that the only option is a transplant for this phase study patients with advanced heart failure were randomly chosen to receive either the gene therapy through cardiac catheterization or a placebo at both six months and a year later the patients who had received the new gene saw their risk for death cardiac transplantation worsening heart failure and hospitalization decline by half results were even more heartening at higher doses where participants had an percent decrease in risk for death cardiac transplant hospitalizations and other outcomes the study authors said redberg cautioned that the study was still preliminary and requires more investigation and research presented at meetings isn t subjected to the same level of scrutiny as studies published in peer reviewed journals the study was funded by the celladon corp of la jolla calif more information the american heart association has more on heart failure,1
chicago reuters men who underwent heart bypass surgery and consumed about two drinks a day afterward had fewer subsequent cardiovascular procedures than those who abstained according to a study released sunday light alcohol consumption was associated with a percent reduction in additional heart procedures heart attacks or strokes in the study by italian researchers presented at the annual meeting of the american heart association in chicago the benefit of light amounts of alcohol consumption has been documented in healthy individuals but our analysis showed a benefit from light alcohol intake in post coronary bypass patients said dr umberto benedetto of the university of rome la sapienza however bypass patients with a condition called left ventricular dysfunction who were heavy drinkers defined as having more than six drinks daily were twice as likely to die from heart problems the study found the italian researchers used a questionnaire to compare alcohol consumption in men who underwent heart bypass surgery and reviewed their medical history for years the study also found no adverse correlation between moderate alcohol consumption and any medication the american heart association recommends men limit themselves to two drinks a day and women to one drink a day because too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and have other negative effects,0
probiotics may help soothe the stomach toggle caption m spencer green ap yogurts and supplements loaded with friendly bacteria may be able to fight the nefarious ones and soothe fickle bowels according to a new study a cochrane library review of studies found that probiotics can shorten the time a person has acute diarrhea with no negative side effects on average using probiotics reduced a bout of diarrhea by more than a day and reduced the risk of a prolonged diarrhea episode four days or more by percent stephen allen a pediatrician at swansea university in the united kingdom who lead the review tells shots that probiotics were effective in almost all the studies which had more than participants total his team evaluated among the different bacteria tested were l acidophilus s boulardii and l casei which occur naturally or are added to products like supplements yogurt miso soy milk and some juices surprising thing was it didn t really matter what type of probiotic was used or in which setting allen says however the impact of the probiotics varied greatly from study to study researcher found authors of the review note that probiotics can work in several ways including robbing the offending bacteria viruses or parasites of nutrients the review confirms the findings of another review in which also showed that probiotics had some effect against diarrhea allen says that since the original review there s been increasing interest in probiotics and therefore more research the conclusions we can draw now are much stronger allen says scientists are also optimistic about using probiotics in developing countries where diarrhea is a big problem and can even be fatal even so allen says more research is needed to determine the specific strains of bacteria that are most effective and he says researchers need to take a look at probiotic regimes that could best target different cases of acute diarrhea in both developed and developing countries,1
there is only moderate evidence that the newly approved prostate cancer drug provenge helps patients according to an analysis done for medicare that was made public on wednesday the analysis is part of a controversial review by the centers for medicare and medicaid services to determine whether to pay for provenge which costs per patient and extended lives by about four months in clinical trials medicare advisers will meet next wednesday to discuss the drug which was developed by dendreon a seattle based biotechnology company provenge is the first so called therapeutic cancer vaccine meaning it works by training the patient s immune system to attack the tumor to win f d a approval the treatment is made for each patient from his own blood sales have been small so far because dendreon s manufacturing capacity has been limited while medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the food and drug administration its debate over paying for provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high priced medicines not only is c m s s action contrary to congress s intent to ensure beneficiary access to drugs and biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen but it threatens to stifle future innovation and cancer research for years to come dr al b benson iii president of the association of community cancer centers said in a comment submitted to the centers for medicare and medicaid services but others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months with expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system especially with private insurance companies first a drug must get f d a approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug medicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug however some analysts have assumed that medicare will pay for provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug s label those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms the medicare review might be more designed to limit off label use of the expensive drug such as for patients who already have symptoms the review for medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether provenge would work if used off label the f d a declined to approve provenge in setting off protests by patients and dendreon investors after dendreon completed another trial which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug provenge was approved this april but the analysis for medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective provenge really was one big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert robyn karnauskas a biotechnology analyst at deutsche bank said in a note to clients wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of provenge boded well for reimbursement historically moderate means that cms will reimburse the product for its on label indication she wrote dendreon s shares rose more than percent in trading after the close of the market the assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the blue cross and blue shield association under contract to the government s agency for healthcare research and quality,1
en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter tuesday nov healthday news using high doses of cholesterol lowering drugs called statins appears to reduce the risk of heart attack stroke or the need for additional cardiac procedures more than regular doses of statins in people who have had a stroke or suffer from heart disease two new studies find this benefit was seen even among those whose cholesterol levels were already low researchers say statins include widely used medications such as crestor lipitor and zocor for high risk people those with heart disease or who have had a stroke who are taking a standard dose of a statin further reduction in ldl cholesterol will give them extra benefit said dr colin baigent of the clinical trial service unit and epidemiological studies unit at university of oxford in the united kingdom who was involved in both studies this applied even if the patients already had low levels of low density lipoprotein ldl or bad cholesterol he noted the reports are published in the nov online edition of the lancet in the first study researchers at oxford and the university of sydney in australia collected data from studies on patients who took part in trials this type of review called a meta analysis gathers data from various studies to see if a pattern emerges among these trials five compared high doses of statins with regular doses and the other studies compared people taking statins with people not taking the drugs the researchers found that in trials comparing statin doses taking high dose statins reduced the odds of having a stroke by an additional percent compared to the usual doses of statins specifically there was a percent reduction in heart related death or heart attack a percent reduction in the need for a new heart operation and a percent reduction in stroke the researchers found when they did an updated analysis of the trials first major cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke were lowered by a highly significant percent for a millimole per liter mmol l reduction of ldl cholesterol taking all trials together deaths were reduced by percent for mmol l in reduction of ldl cholesterol with no significant effect on deaths from stroke or other vascular causes in addition there were no significant effects of statins on deaths due to cancer or other non vascular causes and no excess risk of cancer even at low ldl cholesterol concentrations the second study is a randomized trial called the study of the effectiveness of additional reductions in cholesterol and homocysteine search led by professor jane armitage also a scientist at the ctsu in oxford this trial looked at the benefits of statin therapy with milligrams mg versus mg simvastatin zocor among heart attack survivors the study was supported by a grant from merck manufacturer of the simvastatin over almost seven years of follow up those taking the higher dose statin had greater reductions in ldl cholesterol compared with those taking the lower dose the reduction in ldl cholesterol from the higher dose ended up decreasing the risk of a major cardiac event by percent the researchers found although the statistic in itself was not clinically significant the researchers noted that the higher dose of zocor simvastatin did result in a risk of a muscle disease times higher than that associated with the lower dose the muscle disease known as myopathy can cause pain weakness and in its rare but most severe form destruction of the muscle tissue leading to kidney failure researchers found that two cases of myopathy occurred with the low dose and cases with the higher dose researchers also found that rhabdomyolysis the most severe form of the muscle disease associated with statins was diagnosed in seven participants given mg of zocor simvastatin compared to none who were given mg of simvastatin two died within a few weeks of developing the disorder with one cause of death mentioning the muscle disorder as a contributing factor researchers also found that seven participants had creatine kinase levels higher than times the upper limit of normal a possible indicator of kidney damage for this reason they noted that the incidence of severe muscle disease on mg of zocor might be an underestimate baigent noted this side effect is one associated with zocor but taking lower doses of other more powerful statins may alleviate the problem there are newer ways of increasing ldl cholesterol reduction by using the newer more potent statins such a lipitor or crestor he said all statins carry the risk of myopathy but lower dosages are associated with a reduced risk bernard m y cheung from the university of hong kong and coauthor of an accompanying journal editorial said that people who are at risk from heart attacks and strokes should have their ldl cholesterol lowered intensively their doctors should consider prescribing a statin either at a high dose or using a more powerful statin he said if you are at risk from a heart attack or stroke either because you have had these conditions before or because you have the risk factors for them you should be considered for intensive treatment to lower the ldl cholesterol cheung said if your blood cholesterol is raised but you do not have other risk factors for heart disease and stroke then your doctor may well decide that you do not need to take any drugs to lower cholesterol he said but if you are at risk from those diseases you would need intensive treatment to lower ldl cholesterol even if your ldl cholesterol level is not very high he added commenting on the studies dr gregg fonarow american heart association spokesman and professor of cardiology at the university of california los angeles said that despite the proven benefits of ldl cholesterol lowering with statin therapy many physicians have been reluctant to prescribe and patients reluctant to take higher doses of more potent statin medications due to concerns about side effects or safety lowering ldl cholesterol by to percent with potent statins such as atorvastatin at mg or rosuvastatin at to mg lowers the risk of major cardiovascular events by to percent he said most patients tolerate higher doses of more potent statins equally well as lower doses of less potent statins fonarow said millions of patients with or at high risk of cardiovascular disease who would derive additional cardiovascular protection from higher doses of more potent statins are not currently treated with these agents but they should be more information for more information on statins visit the u s national library of medicine,1

both tests would be less expensive than colonoscopy and potentially more effective compliance with colonoscopy is low since people don t want to have one and the overall cost per detection is high because most people are healthy and even colonoscopy misses many tumors in the upper part of the intestine exact sciences now plans to enlist several thousand patients in a prospective trial designed to win the food and drug administration s approval the trial will be completed in and the test if approved should be available shortly thereafter if widely used and regularly this test really does have the opportunity to eliminate colon cancer said dr david a ahlquist a colon cancer expert at the mayo clinic and an adviser to exact sciences the practical value of the tests depends critically on details like their sensitivity meaning the proportion of tumors that are detected and their specificity meaning how many of the positive results are in fact false alarms exact sciences reported in july that its test was highly sensitive and specific when applied directly to cells taken from tumors but in the real world the tumor dna must be detected in stool samples even though almost all the dna comes from the bacteria of the gut just percent of the dna is human and most of this is normal dna not the altered dna of tumors newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you re not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please re enter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you will receive emails containing news content updates and promotions from the new york times you may opt out at any time you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times s products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters the company reported thursday at a meeting of the american association for cancer research that in a trial of patients the test had detected percent of adenomas or polyps larger than one centimeter in diameter and percent of cancers as judged by the colonoscopies also given to the patients dr ahlquist said he was very pleased with the new results especially the percent detection rate for precancerous polyps since these are best targets for intervention although such a detection rate sounds far from perfect it can be effective if the test is given on a regular schedule the pap smear detects only percent of cervical cancers but applied over time it virtually eliminates the disease dr ahlquist said advertisement continue reading the main story the specificity of the exact sciences test is percent meaning that percent of the time the patient will be given a false alarm this may be acceptable given that the worst that will happen is that the patient will get an unnecessary colonoscopy with stool tests you need a percent specificity said dr bert vogelstein a cancer expert at johns hopkins university who is also an adviser to the company exact sciences has gotten close to that there s a lot of hope for getting a stool based test promising results for the blood based tests were reported this week at a meeting in barcelona spain epigenomics said its test had a sensitivity of percent and a specificity of percent proponents of each test note possible weaknesses of the other dr achim plum a vice president for epigenomics said that to percent of people have small polyps but less than percent of these ever become cancerous the colon based test may pick up too many of these sending far too many people in for colonoscopy the health economics of such a test make no sense he said but the blood based test may have a similar problem since a positive signal could come from cancers anywhere in the body if the patient is advised to take a whole body imaging scan more false positives could be generated so you end up doing more harm than good dr vogelstein said dr plum said that epigenomics did not see its test as being necessarily in competition with the exact sciences test because the blood based test would be good alternative for people put off by stool testing,1
by steven reinberg healthday reporter thursday oct healthday news a new noninvasive test to detect pre cancerous polyps and colon tumors appears to be more accurate than current noninvasive tests such as the fecal occult blood test mayo clinic researchers say the search for a highly accurate noninvasive alternative to invasive screens such as colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy is a holy grail of colon cancer research in a preliminary trial the new test was able to identify percent of pre cancerous polyps and percent of full blown cancers the researchers reported dr floriano marchetti an assistant professor of clinical surgery in the division of colon and rectal surgery at university of miami sylvester comprehensive cancer center said the new test could be an important adjunct to colon cancer screening if it proves itself in further study obviously these findings need to be replicated on a larger scale he said hopefully this is a good start for a more reliable test dr durado brooks director of colorectal cancer at the american cancer society agreed these findings are interesting he said they will be more interesting if we ever get this kind of data in a screening population the study s lead researcher remained optimistic there are new cases of colon cancer each year in the united states treated at an estimated cost of billion noted dr david a ahlquist professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the mayo clinic in rochester minn the dream is to eradicate colon cancer altogether and the most realistic approach to getting there is screening he said and screening not only in a way that would not only detect cancer but pre cancer our test takes us closer to that dream ahlquist was scheduled to present the findings of the study thursday in philadelphia at a meeting on colorectal cancer sponsored by the american association for cancer research the new technology called the cologuard sdna test works by identifying specific altered dna in cells shed by pre cancerous or cancerous polyps into the patient s stool if a dna abnormality is found a colonoscopy would still be needed to confirm the results just as happens now after a positive fecal occult blood test fobt result to see whether the test was effective ahlquist s team tried it out on more than frozen stool samples from patients with and without colorectal cancer the test was able to detect percent of colorectal cancers and percent of polyps bigger than centimeter polyps this size are considered pre cancers and most likely to progress to cancer ahlquist said the sensitivity of the test is much better than what has been seen in other stool screening tests the acs brooks added but showing that in a small group of samples is very different from demonstrating that in a population where only a small number of individuals are going to have polyps of that size then we will know if this is a big step forward he said according to ahlquist cologuard is the first noninvasive test to detect pre cancerous polyps he added in addition the test is the only one that is able to identify cancer in all locations throughout the colon something which other tests either can t or don t do well ahlquist said one more advantage patients do not need to do any special preparation before taking the test something that other tests require he added ahlquist noted that the test still needs to be refined we learned there are still some bugs and we can make the test even better he said cologuard is not yet available for sale clinical trials comparing the test with colonoscopy are slated to start next year ahlquist hopes that the test will be approved and available within two years ahlquist noted that the cost of the test has not yet been established it is expected to cost more than a fecal occult blood test but far less than a colonoscopy a fecal occult blood test can cost as little as while a colonoscopy can total another benefit is that it would probably need to be done once every three years while the fecal occult blood test is usually done yearly savings over time on a more accurate test done fewer times could justify the higher cost of the cologuard test ahlquist said in two other presentations at the meeting researchers have linked key gene variants to the risk for colon cancer and also to the prognosis of the disease in one study researchers found that people who have long telomeres the small strips of dna that cover the ends of chromosomes have a percent increased risk of developing colon cancer even for people their age their telomeres were longer than you d expect for healthy people lead researcher dr lisa a boardman an associate professor of medicine at the mayo clinic said in a statement this suggests that there may be two different mechanisms that affect telomere length and that set up susceptibility to cancer she said in the other study a research team led by kim m smits a molecular biologist and epidemiologist in the grow school for oncology and developmental biology at maastricht university medical center in the netherlands uncovered a surprise when it came to a gene variant on the kras gene called the g variant this variant long linked to poorer outcomes in advanced colorectal cancer actually predicted a better prognosis in early stage colon cancer you would intuitively think that the g variant would be associated with a poorer prognosis as it is in late stage colorectal cancer but that is not the case smits said in a statement experts point out that studies presented at scientific meetings do not have to pass the rigorous

oct a university of manchester england engineering professor has invented a portable breast scanner that could lead to more accurate tests for younger women without the need for x rays the scanner is based on radiofrequency technology which is able to quickly show malignant and benign tumors when linked to a computer it could be used in doctors offices radio waves radiofrequency or microwave technology for breast cancer detection is not new but what zhipeng wu phd from manchester s school of electrical and electronic engineering has achieved is the speed of results and portability the patented real time radiofrequency scanner uses computer tomography and works by using the same technology as a mobile phone but with only a tiny fraction of its power costs are reduced and the electronics fit into a case the size of a lunchbox breast cancer current mammography testing works well for detecting breast cancer in women over with results of up to accuracy the manchester team says it is far less effective for younger women where the detection rate could be as low as for women under the age of this group the team says accounts for of all breast cancer cases how it works while mammography works on breast density radiofrequency looks at contrasts between normal and diseased breast tissues the breast is placed in a scanner cup and an image appears on screen tumors or other abnormalities show up in red wu says in a news release the system we have is portable and as soon as you lie down you can get a scan it s real time the real time imaging minimizes the chance of missing a breast tumor during scanning wu says it will even work through a bra although there is still research to be done the system has great potential to bring a new way for breast cancer diagnosis reaction carolyn rogers clinical nurse specialist at breast cancer care in the u k says in an emailed statement evidence is needed to demonstrate the accuracy and uses of this device the most effective screening tool for detecting breast cancer is mammography and for women of all ages to remain breast aware reporting any changes to their doctor,1
oct a new consumer friendly test for colon cancer once approved could persuade more americans to undergo screening for the deadly cancer according to researchers presenting their findings on the test s effectiveness at a cancer conference in philadelphia at the same meeting other researchers reported that they have new clues about how dna characteristics can help predict colon cancer risk the research was presented at the american association for cancer research s special conference colorectal cancer biology to therapy screening for colon cancer back story one in every of us will have colon cancer in our lifetime says david ahlquist md professor of medicine and a consultant in gastroenterology at the mayo clinic in rochester minn who presented his findings on the new colon cancer screening test although colon cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death for men and women in the u s many adults don t undergo the screenings once they reach age or earlier for those with a family history ahlquist told a news conference estimates of how many adults undergo screening vary but ahlquist says probably only adhere to the screening schedule over time one screening test the colonoscopy in which a flexible lighted tube with a video camera is inserted to examine the colon requires dietary restriction and preparation of the colon patients must often take time off work and need transportation home from the procedure,1
en español sunday oct healthday news bitter taste receptors are located in the lungs as well as on the tongue a finding that might lead to improved treatments for asthma and other obstructive lung diseases according to researchers at the university of maryland school of medicine in baltimore the detection of functioning taste receptors on smooth muscle of the bronchus in the lungs was so unexpected that we were at first quite skeptical ourselves said the study s senior author dr stephen b liggett professor of medicine and physiology and director of the university s cardiopulmonary genomics program in a university news release the receptors in the lungs which the team found by accident in an unrelated study are the same as those on the tongue but the tongue s receptors are clustered in taste buds that send signals to the brain while the receptors in the lungs are not grouped in buds and don t send signals to the brain explained the research team however they still respond to bitter tastes the researchers tested different bitter compounds on human and mouse airways individual airway smooth muscle cells and on mice with asthma they found that these compounds all opened lung airways more profoundly than current drugs the study appears online oct in the journal nature medicine new drugs to treat asthma emphysema or chronic bronchitis are needed this could replace or enhance what is now in use and represents a completely new approach said liggett but he added simply eating bitter tasting foods or compounds won t help people with asthma based on our research we think that the best drugs would be chemical modifications of bitter compounds which would be aerosolized and then inhaled into the lungs with an inhaler he said the research which is preliminary was supported by grants from the u s national heart lung and blood institute of the national institutes of health more information the u s national heart lung and blood institute has more about asthma,0

he said more research was needed but for now i think the market is running way out in front of the science photo scientists agree that dha naturally transmitted to a fetus through the placenta in the last half of pregnancy is important probably to visual and brain development several studies indicate that babies born prematurely receive too little dha and some studies have found that premature babies fed dha after birth show better cognitive performance or visual coordination later on than preemies who aren t given dha but the new study which mainly assessed full term babies found no cognitive difference at months whether mothers received dha supplements or placebos the lead researcher dr maria makrides of the university of adelaide in australia said this suggested that full term babies already get enough dha in the womb and that there s no extra boost from getting more nonetheless several experts said they would continue to support taking dha in pregnancy especially since it is safe and apparently has few downsides they cited a smaller norwegian study that found i q increases at age although no cognitive benefit was seen in infants or year olds newsletter sign up continue reading the main story please verify you re not a robot by clicking the box invalid email address please re enter you must select a newsletter to subscribe to sign up you will receive emails containing news content updates and promotions from the new york times you may opt out at any time you agree to receive occasional updates and special offers for the new york times s products and services thank you for subscribing an error has occurred please try again later view all new york times newsletters that study s lead author dr ingrid helland of oslo university hospital said that perhaps the benefit shown at age existed at but was difficult to identify amid other developmental factors she said babies in her study might have received more dha than those in this study dr oken said the new study might have shown no benefit in month olds because effects in infants might be hard to measure or it may be that the benefit of dha is not as important as when you re dr makrides s team plans assessments at and dr jatinder bhatia a neonatologist heading the nutrition committee of the american academy of pediatrics said that unless further studies showed no benefit as children got older he would continue recommending dha now in many prenatal vitamins because i m not convinced at this time that we should reverse course much about dha is unknown its effect in supplements for children and adults is being studied as well as whether supplements offer the same benefit as dha rich fish like salmon some studies including the new report suggest dha supplementation in pregnancy reduces the likelihood of premature birth and the new study showed small reductions in postpartum depression in women with histories or high risk of depression dr scott stuart a university of iowa psychiatry and psychology professor said his pregnant patients with mild to moderate depression had improved when taking dha while seeing a counselor there s no harm that we know of at all in contrast to many antidepressants he said and it might be of some help,1
oct vitamin b may help protect the brain against alzheimer s disease according to new evidence that suggests the vitamin and an amino acid called homocysteine may both be involved in the development of alzheimer s high levels of vitamin b in the blood are already known to help reduce levels of homocysteine which has been linked to an increased risk of alzheimer s disease memory loss and stroke but researchers say the relationship between homocysteine and vitamin b levels and alzheimer s disease risk has been unclear the seven year study followed finnish people ages to who did not have any symptoms of alzheimer s disease at the start of the study during the study published in neurology people developed alzheimer s disease researchers found that each picomolar increase in blood vitamin b level was associated with a reduction in the risk of alzheimer s disease among the elderly in addition each micromolar increase in blood homocysteine level raised the risk of alzheimer s disease by blood levels of folate another nutrient believed to lower homocysteine levels were not linked to alzheimer s disease risk our findings show the need for further research on the role of vitamin b as a marker for identifying people who are at increased risk of alzheimer s disease says researcher babak hooshmand md msc with karolinska institutet in stockholm sweden in a news release low levels of vitamin b are surprisingly common in the elderly the few studies that have investigated the usefulness of vitamin b supplements to reduce the risk of memory loss have had mixed results says hooshmand common dietary sources of vitamin b include fish poultry and meat products,1
oct an analysis of studies involving about million people shows a significant association between using cholesterol lowering drugs called statins and a reduced risk for colorectal cancer the analysis shows there was a reduction of colorectal cancer risk among statin users also the longer patients used statin drugs the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer the findings are based on a review of studies published through october and were presented at the american college of gastroenterology s acg th annual scientific meeting in san antonio study researcher n jewel samadder md msc from the university of michigan ann arbor says the relationship between statin use and a reduction in risk for colorectal cancer was consistent across various study designs this effect was largely consistent across study design with both case control and cohort studies showing a strong correlation he says in a news release the length of statin use both greater than six months and greater than five years of use was associated with reduction in colorectal cancer risk the group of statins that showed the greatest effect in reducing risk are classified as lipophilic atorvastatin lipitor fluvastatin lescol lovastatin altocor altoprev mevacor pitavastatin livalo and simvastatin zocor colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the u s new cases of colon cancer are diagnosed in men and women every year and about new cases of rectal cancer are diagnosed annually the relationship between statins and cancer is unclear but other research exploring the impact of statins at the molecular level suggests that these cholesterol lowering drugs may help control the development of tumor as well as tumor growth observational studies have suggested that long term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers including breast prostate lung pancreas and liver says samadder in the news release our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted this study was presented at a medical conference the findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the peer review process in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal,1

ventricular assist system at her home in marlborough massachusetts september the device implanted inside the patient s chest and powered by external rechargable batteries connected by a cable coming out of the patient s side pumps blood through the circulatory system on a continuous basis taking over most of the heart s work reuters brian snyder had she organized things well enough she wondered so that her eldest son who was in charge of the estate would not be burdened had she taught her handicapped son an adult enough life skills to take care of himself she asked that the ave maria be played at her funeral a week later verna s sister drove her hours from lowell indiana to rochester minnesota to the mayo clinic one of the country s best hospitals for heart surgery her daughter flew in from kansas by the time verna arrived at the hospital she could barely walk to the admissions desk i leaned over the railing gasping for breath she said i told my daughter you have to get me a wheelchair verna now was suffering from heart failure a progressive condition that in its advanced stages makes walking even a few feet difficult she had received multiple treatments including drugs and an implantable heart defibrillator but nothing was working in a final hail mary doctors decided to implant an experimental battery powered mechanical heart pump known as a left ventricular assist

l bean fishing vest that carries her equipment while powered by battery patients can go about much of their daily lives but being plugged into the wall at night albeit with a cord long enough for a trip to the bathroom takes some getting used to you know how they tether dogs to a clothes line said norris with a laugh that s what it feels like an unnatural death the rise in use of mechanical heart devices represents a dramatic leap forward in the treatment of heart failure but it also raises some potentially troubling ethical questions these machines have the capacity to extend life beyond its natural cycle and beyond what might be desirable this is one of the ways our technology has moved ahead of our humanity said stevenson we haven t had enough experience yet about how to help people die naturally who have a ventricular assist device and i can tell you it is difficult to die with one of these things in place the body does not give up easily when the blood flow is maintained not that patients don t die infections are a fairly common cause of death as are bleeding and stroke but death may not always come naturally and decisions must be made about turning the device off we have to address what is the meaning of death on one of these pumps said dr valluvan jeevanandam chief of cardiac and thoracic surgery at the university of chicago medical center and an investigator for thoratec s clinical trials roughly percent of patients on the heartmate ii were alive after a year and nearly percent were alive after two years according to the latest data it s not hard to imagine a person who has had severe stroke that has impacted both sides of the brain the kidneys are shutting down he is on a respirator but yet the lvad just keeps churning along said martin smith a clinical ethicist at the cleveland clinic under u s law patients are allowed to ask that implanted devices be turned off but dr diane meier a professor in the department of geriatrics and palliative medicine at the mount sinai school of medicine said cardiologists are particularly bad at preparing patients for death especially this kind of death the number of consults that the palliative team gets from cardiologists can be measured on one hand she said we are called upon much more frequently by physicians in other disciplines holy grail still lvads are improving the quality of life for hundreds of patients including dick cheney the former vice president of the united states and a multiple heart attack survivor moreover the importance of lvad technology goes beyond its impact on existing patients it provides a platform for research into stem cell and other therapies designed to regenerate a patient s own heart the holy grail is for a sick patient to get a pump which immediately helps said dr randall starling head of heart failure and cardiac transplant medicine at the cleveland clinic then we inject his own stem cells maybe in one shot or over the course of a year then he improves and his heart recovers and then he has the pump removed lvads have made regenerative therapy research the new science that uses stem cells to generate new organs and tissue much easier since the risk of hurting a patient is minimal the lvad carries out the heart s main pumping function no matter what research is conducted on the patient s own heart once the patient undergoes a transplant the treated native heart with its cells and its genes can be examined and studied in five years we will have some fairly substantial number of patients treated and followed for a couple of years said dr leslie w miller director of the university of south florida s cardiovascular clinical and research integrated strategic program these advances may never materialize or they could be years down the road even so early data have proved promising and young patients who are scheduled to receive a transplant might consider postponing the procedure which is irreversible miller said maybe a mechanical pump is a better five to year solution for these people because we hope to be in a better place by that time with stem cell technology and other regenerative models he said transplant survival at one year is to percent and to percent at five years and i think we can have these kind of figures with these devices crazy robotic heart daniel roth who just turned is one of the young people faced with such a decision since receiving his lvad a year and a half ago he has lived an active life he works in a hospital exercises and plays in a rock band teamwork he is determined to get a transplant i could wait five years and hope stem cell therapy will work but by then i m nearly and i have things i want to do he said i want to be a musician and go on tour i would sacrifice some years off the end of my life not too many for the years left to be as awesome as they can be roth says he has been told transplant patients can expect to live to years but dr mark slaughter professor and chief of the division of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery at the university of louisville is not so sanguine the survival rate at one year is more than percent he said but after that there is a percent decline every year so that in years everyone is dead you have a very finite timeline roth who lives with his parents in norwood massachusetts became ill in late with stomach pains and shortness of breath while studying marine biology at roger williams university in rhode island in january he had a stroke he was diagnosed with an enlarged heart and placed on the list for a transplant for the next two years he returned repeatedly to the hospital with symptoms such as vomiting fluid retention and shortness of breath a defibrillator was implanted i became very depressed and docile said roth who these days brims with optimism and energy playing in my band took every last ounce of strength he struggled on with medications but in early he caught a stomach bug that he could not shake he returned to the hospital while there his heart stopped he coded for about six minutes said his mother ellen tearfully emergency workers revived him but by that time he was too ill for transplant surgery even if he had been physically fitter there is no guarantee a donor heart would have been available it is estimated that some people around the world are candidates for heart transplant but only patients per year get them the only option for me was this crazy robotic heart he said it was implanted in april that summer was amazing he said i traveled with my band i did everything i didn t realize how sick i was until i got this thing now he is eligible once again for a transplant and he wants one he wants to be free of the encumbrances of the lvad the endless changing of the batteries the fear that the wiring might crap out that a power outage might hit he remembers vividly a fourth of july weekend away with friends in maine a fuse in the old house they were staying in blew and cut all power it was like a bad movie where the clock starts ticking on your life he said a flurry of calls to doctors and nearby hospitals led him to maine medical center in portland which had an extra base unit but he fears that if he is on tour in a remote part of the country or overseas he may not be so lucky to get his heart transplant roth needs to manage his weight one of his biggest challenges since one of the criteria for matching a donor heart with a recipient is weight class a heart donated by a pound woman won t support a pound man i m doing well now i ve lost pounds and after the transplant i ll be an angel he said ebulliently expanding market in addition to regenerative medicine coming down the pike new generations of lvads are also in development the heartmate ii is a third generation device and a vast improvement over its predecessor the heartmate xve which was so large it could not be used in small women and noisy enough to be disconcerting both to the patient and those around him dan mooney who had a long history of heart attacks and had several bypass surgeries by the time he was received a prior generation lvad in early shortly after and survived on it for about months according to his widow cathy but people found him scary he would get into an elevator with his fishing vest and all these wires coming out and he was ticking she said in public he scared people half to death the heartmate ii by contrast is quiet it pumps blood on a continuous basis which eliminates the pulse currently the heartmate ii dominates the market but a rival company heartware international inc of framingham massachusetts is developing a smaller device that some experts believe could if approved as expected by early gain significant market share and possibly eclipse the heartmate ii i think the market overall is going to be very substantial but i do think that ultimately heartware has a better product so if that s the case why not try and bet on the best in class technology said kris jenner a portfolio manager at t rowe price healthcare sciences fund jenner expects the market for ventricular assist devices to be worth as much as billion in five years time still heartware ceo douglas godshall is cautious about building expectations too high we have certain advantages over thoratec our device is smaller and can be placed in the chest rather than a pocket in the abdomen which physicians like and it s a faster procedure he said but it is not an insignificant advantage to already have approval and be on the market and have had a chance to work out a lot of your kinks we are just finding out what our kinks are larry feinberg who runs oracle investment management and holds shares in thoratec said he believes both companies will be winners over the long term i don t think there will be one dominant player and the other falls by the wayside he said i see it more as being a pretty close horse race with each technological advance causing each to leapfrog the other there are very high expectations for heartware if their data isn t perfect the stock could get really slammed results of heartware s pivotal advance bridge to transplant trial will be presented at this year s annual american heart association meeting in november and both physicians and wall street analysts expect positive results estimates vary as to the ultimate number of people who could benefit from the device with some predicting and others more than how far the market expands will likely depend on whether the device is used to treat patients at an earlier stage of their disease in the hope of staving off a worsening of symptoms stevenson the harvard professor said there is a spirited debate occurring in the medical community about the merits of this risks that seem very reasonable for somebody who has a miserable quality of life at home may be less reasonable if we have somebody who doesn t feel all that bad at home said stevenson we don t really have much data at all beyond two years and we re already finding some surprises that are not such happy news in particular she said physicians are finding that there is more bleeding and a different kind of bleeding much of it in the colon stomach and nose than seen with thoratec s earlier device the heartmate xve right now we re all waiting to see how much more that s going to be she said thoratec chief executive gary burbach said the company is studying the problem which appears with the continuous flow pump technology and is thought to somehow cause a disruption in the complex blood clotting process thoratec will continue to develop its pumps based on the current technology he said and doctors can manage the bleeding with medication breaking free from the wire experts agree that there will be an advantage to whichever company can dispense with the external drive line so that the entire system including batteries and controller are beneath the skin and power is transmitted across the skin i m a believer that the percutaneous drive line ultimately needs to go away said slaughter the university of louisville professor who is co principal investigator on heartware s bridge to transplant trial totally implantable lvad technology known as transcutaneous energy transmission systems tets are not new but before being clinically useful the technology and battery life need to be improved said slaughter if you wanted a tet system from which you could disconnect for to minutes a day you could have one in six months he said that might give a patient the chance to jump in a shower but probably would not be worth the more complicated surgery if a patient could be disconnected for two hours a day enough to swim relax in a hot tub or be intimate with a partner that could significantly increase their quality of life if you want to be disconnected for one hour twice a day i think that could be doable within the next two years slaughter said slideshow images thoratec has its sights set on developing a totally implantable device with no drive line and longer running batteries within five years burbach said it is still unclear how long the devices will keep patients alive experts say they could last as long as years verna schrombeck for one has come to terms with the uncertainty there is a tranquility that one has she said you ve fought your battles and you ve learned to accept life as it is now lightning bugs the fireflies the deer that come up and stand on their hind legs as they grab the apples we don t know where this is going to lead

oct even when medical or surgical castration fails a potent drug extends survival by four months in patients with metastatic prostate cancer the drug is johnson johnson s abiraterone acetate it blocks an enzyme crucial to the production of male hormones which spur the growth and spread of advanced prostate cancers the treatment gave patients with metastatic castration resistant prostate cancer only an extra four months of life but there s more hope than that from the study of some men with late stage cancer at medical centers in nations the study was funded by johnson johnson which is developing the drug it appears that abiraterone is able to shut down androgen production not only in the testes but also from the adrenal gland and from within prostate tumors themselves and while the average patient survived only four months longer than those on standard chemotherapy months vs months some patients did much better a key question now is to work out which patients will benefit from the drug clearly some patients do and some don t johann de bono md phd of the u k s royal marsden nhs foundation trust says in a news release de bono reported the study findings in at this week s meeting of the european society for medical oncology in milan italy this study was presented at a medical conference the findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the peer review process in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal,0
some of the country is either overweight or obese but there s not much clinical evidence on the best way to lose weight outside of research on bariatric surgery true eat less and exercise more is great advice if you can manage to follow it but public health authorities have repeated that line until they re blue in the face and as a population we ve only gotten fatter research presented over the weekend at the annual meeting of the obesity society and published online in the journal of the american medical association suggests a few specific strategies that may help namely making a commercial weight loss program including packaged foods free in the study some overweight or obese women were randomly assigned to the jenny craig weight loss program with once weekly face to face counseling sessions to the same program with weekly phone counseling or to a control group that received usual care i e publicly available materials on diet and exercise the two groups using the program also got payments for every month clinic visit to assess weight and other measurements jenny craig a unit of nestlé funded the research after two years the in person group had lost an average of pounds the phone group lost pounds and the control group lost pounds in the editorial accompanying the study rena wing a professor of psychiatry and human behavior at brown university s warren alpert medical school writes the results suggest that if commercial weight loss programs such as jenny craig were free to those who want to lose weight both retention and average weight loss outcomes might be far better than when participants must pay for these programs the program costs about for weeks she writes compare that to the to cost of bariatric surgery which is often reimbursed by insurers the countervailing theory is that people value things more when they pay for them and that the mere act of ponying up for three months of a diet program may make you take it more seriously wing calls for cost effectiveness studies conducted by researchers without any financial ties to the companies involved that compare different commercial programs with each other she also notes that more research on weight loss maintenance is needed since the average weight loss was greater at one year than at the end of the study further reading,1

en español by amanda gardner healthday reporter wednesday sept healthday news another study evaluating the value of mammograms for younger women finds that screening can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer for women in their s the study done in sweden found that women who were screened cut their risk by percent that means screening women five times over a year period would save one life study author hakan jonsson said during a teleconference wednesday the research was published online wednesday in the journal cancer and is to be presented at the american society of clinical oncology s annual breast cancer symposium which starts friday in national harbor md the findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their s last year the u s preventive services task force recommended that women in their s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned and even then it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years that recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists while other organizations including the american cancer society continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their s to further stir the pot a norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently the value of mammograms for women and older is not in question speaking at the teleconference dr jennifer obel chair of the american society of clinical oncology s communications committee said this study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group many women aged to want unambiguous recommendations while the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field the critical message here is that all women starting at age should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged to obel added the real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test we need to discuss that test with our patients it remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population the authors of the new research the largest epidemiological study of its kind looked at screening and mortality data for women in sweden although screening is mandated for woman aged to in that country the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties the study authors compared death registry data on women in their s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited in all more than million women were involved in the study and the follow up period was a lengthy years the reduction was estimated at percent to percent depending on the model used according to the study the reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered the benefits were greater in women aged to vs those aged to the researchers said jonsson an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at umea university in sweden could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies he mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years in another study released during the wednesday press conference researchers from m d anderson cancer center at the university of texas in houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments there was a significant improvement in survival overall including all patients with all stages of breast cancer even those who had disseminated cancer said study author dr aman buzdar a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at m d anderson although the data which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at m d anderson between and came from a single institution buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients more information the u s national cancer institute has more on mammography,1

a no cringe fix filling cavities without the drill toggle caption gretchen cuda for npr it s just past a m and kimberly baker is reclining in the dental chair at case western reserve university s school of dental medicine in cleveland baker has three cavities this morning she ll be getting two of them drilled the old fashioned way but the third is a decay that is not so advanced and dr jin ho phark her dentist is going to use a treatment he s testing that involves no drilling which is nice because many patients don t like the sound of the drill and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it phark says that cringe worthy sound may be on the way out a new procedure used by phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or novocain the treatment called icon is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling icon was developed in germany and has been available in the u s for just over a year it s intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel to drill or not to drill phark says that when decay is caught very early or very late dentists have a clear course of action early problems can often be reversed with better brushing fluoride or calcium containing toothpastes and late stage cavities need to be filled but at the intermediate stages dentists don t have many options in many of those cases we decide ok this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling so we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled phark says german researcher sebastian paris is a dentist and one of the drill less cavity treatment s developers we aim to treat these intermediate lesions not the very early ones but the intermediate ones where usually as a dentist you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not paris says how it works when tooth decay begins minerals like calcium are leached out of the tooth enamel leaving behind sponge like pores in the enamel if the decay process is allowed to continue the pores grow and form a hole known as a cavity the new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel then the open pores are filled with a clear resin toggle caption gretchen cuda for npr paris says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn t thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge when you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee paris says but if you put your sugar cube into honey you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube cheaper lighter alternatives to the drill avoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth however some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms tooth decay can be stopped and even reversed by the patients themselves using for example fluoride toothpaste an alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking coca cola all day long says mark wolff a professor of dentistry at new york university who specializes in cariology or the study of tooth decay wolff says that while the no drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise fluoride treatments and other patient applied methods are still more inexpensive less invasive and have a much longer track record of success might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing absolutely i think the jury is still out on the product a little bit hopefully it works it s just still in its earliest stages wolff says because it s so new it s still unclear how the icon resin filling holds up over time and clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to percent of the time but wolff says that for patients who aren t able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits or who are predisposed to tooth decay this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist s drill at bay,1
cnn a new study released thursday suggests mammograms might not be as effective in reducing deaths from breast cancer in women over as previously thought the study published in the new england journal of medicine analyzed data from more than women with breast cancer it concluded the availability of mammography screening corresponded with a reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer but the screening itself accounted for only about a third of the total reduction the study involved women in norway between ages and researchers from norway and harvard university compared the death rates from breast cancer in four groups one group of women from through who were living in norwegian counties with screening another group in the same time period who were living in counties without screening and two similar groups from through among women in the nonscreening group there was an percent reduction in the rate of death from breast cancer as compared with the preceding year period presumably as a result of increased breast cancer awareness improved therapy and the use of more sensitive diagnostic tools the findings state among women in the screening group there was a percent reduction in mortality from breast cancer during the same period thus the relative reduction in mortality that was causally related to the screening program alone was percent the publication notes that in the world health organization concluded that mammography screening for women between ages and reduced the death rate from breast cancer by percent researchers said challenges in measuring the effectiveness of mammography screenings include increases in breast cancer awareness and advances in treatment,1
en español by karen pallarito healthday reporter wednesday sept healthday news routine mammograms account for only about one third of the decline in breast cancer death rates according to a large new analysis of data from norway s expansive breast cancer screening program the other two thirds of the reduction is probably due to such factors as increased cancer awareness improved therapy and use of more sensitive diagnostic tools the study authors suggest the analysis published in the sept issue of the new england journal of medicine raises new questions about the benefits versus risks of screening mammography and is already reigniting tensions over its frequency of use in the united states women should be informed that the benefit is smaller than expected and there should be a balanced discussion on the benefit and the possible harms of screening such as overdiagnosis false negative and positive tests and psychological distress said the study s lead author dr mette kalager an epidemiologist with the cancer registry of norway in oslo and a visiting scientist at the harvard school of public health in boston this study will only add to the confusion for women and their physicians said dr daniel b kopans director of breast imaging at massachusetts general hospital and a radiology professor at harvard medical school last november the u s preventive services task force spurred dissension among breast cancer experts with controversial new guidelines for breast cancer screening the task force recommended that women begin having screening mammograms at age not and that those exams occur every other year instead of annually but some cancer organizations reject the panel s advice the american cancer society still recommends annual mammograms starting at age as long as a woman is still in good health on tuesday the american college of radiology acr the society of breast imaging and the american society of breast disease launched mammography saves lives a campaign designed to encourage women to have an annual mammogram starting at age mammography is not perfect no one has claimed that it is said kopans a member of the acr commission on breast imaging but since the advent of routine mammograms in the s the rate of death from breast cancer has dropped percent he observed that s a huge achievement kopans noted adding that it may not be a big deal to an epidemiologist who s looking at huge numbers and doesn t take care of women with breast problems norway s breast cancer screening program began in and was expanded two years later with staggered enrollment by county over a period of nine years since all norwegian women aged to have been invited to have a screening mammogram every two years the authors said for the study more than norwegian women were followed for an average of years researchers compared death rates from breast cancer among four groups of women two that were living in counties with or without screening and two groups that lived in the same counties before screening was offered the difference in the rate of death from breast cancer among women in the screening group versus the control group was percent in comparison there was an percent reduction in the rate of death in the non screened group versus the control group the study found in other words breast cancer screening was associated with a reduction in death but only accounted for percentage points of the difference our observed percent reduction in death from breast cancer is much lower than previously thought kalager said it is plausible that today the effect of increased breast awareness and improved therapy have outweighed the effect of screening on reducing mortality from breast cancer both kopans and dr otis w brawley the american cancer society s chief medical officer criticized the research team s short follow up period just years of observation on average they both said that the time frame was insufficient to assess the effect of screening in an accompanying editorial dr h gilbert welch a professor of medicine and community and family medicine at the dartmouth institute for health policy and clinical practice in lebanon n h said the norwegian study helps to confirm that the decision to undergo screening mammography is a close call welch author of a book should i be tested for cancer maybe not and here s why suggested that with better treatment and increased awareness of the importance of seeking care for breast abnormalities screening mammography may be less important now than in the past that physicians are still debating the relative merits of screening mammography despite the wealth of data suggests that the test is surely a close call a delicate balance between modest benefit and modest harm welch wrote but kopans noted that mammography is still the only test that has been proven to reduce the death rate from breast cancer and that this study should not divert attention away from that fact it s clearly muddying the waters he said more information learn more about screening mammograms by visiting the u s national cancer institute,1

fat cells watch out two new devices one that deflates fat cells one that destroys them have just been cleared for body contouring in doctors offices by the food and drug administration zeltiq grabs onto love handles and belly pouches and freezes the fat cells inside causing them to self destruct over several months zerona is a low level laser that rotates around the waist hips and thighs forcing the fat cells to empty in a matter of weeks in both cases there are no incisions no downtime and no need for anesthesia the fat is reabsorbed by the body several other devices that claim to painlessly blast away fat with ultrasound radio waves or lasers are already on the market or hoping for fda approval soon these high tech weapons in the battle of the bulge are less invasive than liposuction which involves loosening fat internally and vacuuming it out with a tube a procedure that nearly americans had last year of course there is still no magic wand for the of us who are overweight or obese eliminating fat cells without also eating less or exercising more may make fat crop up elsewhere and ultimately do more harm than good that s because fat cells are not just passive storage depots for surplus calories they are busy chemical factories that send signals all over the body helping to regulate growth puberty healing disease fighting and aging among the or more hormones that fat cells secrete are adiponectine which helps manage metabolism and leptin which tells the brain to eat more or less although the brain doesn t always listen much about fat cells remains mysterious they re among the largest and longest living cells in the body capable of expanding at least times their original size the upper limit is unknown a lean adult has about billion fat cells an obese adult can have billion zerona laser erchonia medical journal community in general it s healthier to have a larger number of small fat cells than fewer fatter ones subcutaneous fat cells under the skin in places like the hips thighs and lower belly may be unsightly but they are relatively benign their principal work is to pull excess fat out of the bloodstream package it and store it in big droplets one per fat cell until the body needs it for energy healthy fat cells are precisely attuned to the body s needs says michael d jensen an endocrinologist at the mayo clinic in rochester minn when you eat too much the fat cells store it up and when you miss a meal they give it back to you but if fat cells aren t working properly they don t store and release fat effectively harmful versions called visceral fat cells accumulate in and around organs like the heart and liver and release fat into the bloodstream raising the risk for heart disease diabetes stroke and alzheimer s disease why some fat cells stop working and why some proliferate while others just balloon isn t understood zeltiq coolsculpting zeltiq heredity clearly plays a role as does taking in more calories than the body needs but fat cell function doesn t necessarily correlate with weight gain some people are able to carry extra pounds and still have functioning fat cells others run into metabolic trouble when they gain just a few pounds according to dr jensen until recently experts thought that all the body s fat cells were created by around age and that they never died just grew and shrunk as people gained or lost weight but scientists at sweden s karolinska institute recently discovered that even in lean people about of the body s fat cells die and are replaced each year the fact that the number seems to remain constant over the years indicates that something is very much regulating the number of fat cells that s what i m interested in right now says neuroscientist kirsty spalding the lead researcher the amount and distribution of fat also changes naturally with age people tend to gain subcutaneous fat through middle age and then it starts to diminish first on the back of the hands then in the lower legs and elsewhere says james l kirkland a professor of aging at the mayo clinic it piles up as visceral fat instead and eventually appears in muscle liver and even bone marrow where the fat is a substitute for new bones losing subcutaneous fat is not good paradoxically dr kirkland says blasting fat that s partly why some obesity experts are wary of the new fat blasting techniques the devices can t target visceral fat only subcutaneous fat and if patients continue to consume more calories than they burn they may hasten that process of accumulating harmful fat instead some experts also worry that forcing fat out of fat cells can increase the level in the bloodstream fat is very toxic says dr jensen it s not something you want in large amounts floating around free you want it inside a cell protected another danger is that losing fat cells could will lower leptin levels signaling to the brain to eat more that s one of the reasons it s so so hard to maintain weight loss the body is trying to defend a weight it got used to says mitchell lazar director of the institute for diabetes obesity and metabolism at the university of pennsylvania officials at zeltiq of pleasanton calif and erchonia corp the mckinney texas company that makes zerona say they had to demonstrate to the fda that triglyceride levels in the body did not rise significantly after their procedures it s the equivalent of eating three to five french fries per day says mitchell levinson zeltiq s founder and chief scientific officer they also say the process is gradual and involves a small percentage of the body s overall fat still both companies stress that it s important for patients to change their eating and exercise lifestyle habits as well this is for patients who have a discreet bulge they want to get rid of says mr levinson your love handle will get smaller but you won t lose any weight unless your change your behavior email write to melinda beck at,1
washington reuters it may be possible to predict which women will develop a dangerous complication of pregnancy called pre eclampsia weeks before they ever show the first symptoms an international team of researchers reported monday a husband touches his wife s stomach in the last stages of her pregnancy in bordeaux april reuters regis duvignau they found a series of different compounds linked with metabolism that were different in the women destined to develop the condition and said that could form the basis of a test such a metabolic fingerprint test could save the lives of thousands of women philip baker of the university of alberta in canada who helped lead the study said in a statement if we can bring the rates of maternal deaths in undeveloped countries down to the rates in developed countries by being able to determine which women are at the greatest risk for developing pre eclampsia then it has that potential to save thousands of lives baker said there is currently no test to predict which women will develop pre eclampsia which is marked by high blood pressure and high protein levels in urine if mothers and their babies survive the women later have a higher risk of high blood pressure heart disease stroke and diabetes the babies are usually born prematurely and suffer complications all their lives the cost of treating mothers with pre eclampsia is billion a year in the united states europe asia australia and new zealand the researchers said in undeveloped countries women die from pre eclampsia each year writing in the journal hypertension the researchers said they did a simple study testing the blood of women who developed pre eclampsia later in pregnancy and women who did not they ran the test at about weeks gestation we identified organic molecules to be significantly elevated and that were reduced in plasma at to weeks gestation they wrote from this series of compounds they narrowed down a list of sugars fats and amino acids that were different in the women who developed the condition it detected around percent of the cases with a false positive rate of about percent meaning percent of the women flagged in the test as having a risk of pre eclampsia would never actually develop it a high caliber predictive test would allow women who are identified at high risk for pre eclampsia to seek obstetric care by specialists and to be monitored more vigilantly eleni tsigas executive director of the pre eclampsia foundation said in a statement it would also ensure that those women are educated about the warning signs of pre eclampsia there s no reason why women should be caught unaware in the late stages of a pre eclampsia crisis,1
london reuters men who have a certain genetic variations that put them at higher risk of prostate cancer may benefit from regular screening for the disease a study by british scientists found friday the findings suggest that by narrowing the focus of prostate cancer screening to those whose genes put them at most risk doctors would catch more cancers early as well as reducing the potential for costly and damaging overdiagnosis although these are early results it appears that prostate cancer screening is reasonably accurate at predicting potentially aggressive prostate cancer among men at higher risk of the disease due to a genetic predisposition said ros eeles who led a research team from britain s institute of cancer research icr and royal marsden hospital the study found that the predictive value of screening these men expressed as the number of cancers detected relative to the number of tissue samples taken was percent far higher than the percent achieved in population wide screening screening for prostate cancer is controversial because the prostate specific antigen psa tests used cannot differentiate between men with aggressive cancer and men who would never have symptoms or need treatment and this can lead to overdiagnosis a study in the united states last year found that routine prostate cancer screening had resulted in more than a million being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them the icr led study is aiming to find out whether screening men who have genetic variants that increase their prostate cancer risk could lead to earlier diagnosis it aims to screen men for five years but results from the first men were published in the british journal of urology international genetic factors that increase prostate cancer risk include inheritable variations in genes known as brca and brca prostate cancer is the second most common cancer in men worldwide and kills men a year u s doctors routinely recommend psa screening in men over on the assumption that early diagnosis and treatment is better than doing nothing but fears about overdiagnosis which can lead to treatments such as surgery radiation or hormone therapy that can cause serious side effects such as impotence and incontinence have so far dissuaded many european countries from nationwide screening the men in this study with confirmed brca or brca mutations and who had tested negative for the mutations were all offered annual psa blood testing and who had raised psa levels were given a follow up biopsy eeles said the findings added to the increasing evidence that brca gene variation carriers develop more aggressive disease and supported the idea that men with genetic risks should be routinely screened for prostate cancer,1
it would certainly be premature to suggest taking statins to prevent rheumatoid arthritis he tells webmd but one important message is that people who have been prescribed them should adhere to treatment right now about of people who begin taking statins stop within two years study researcher gabriel chodick md called the risk reduction important and meaningful but he says more research is needed to confirm the association the regular use of statins was associated with a reduction in rheumatoid arthritis ra risk in a newly reported study of patients enrolled in one of israel s largest health plans sept people who take cholesterol lowering statin drugs to reduce heart disease risk may also be cutting their risk for developing the painful inflammatory joint disease rheumatoid arthritis statins and rheumatoid arthritis the most widely prescribed class of drugs in the world statins such as crestor lescol lipitor pravachol and zocor reduce cholesterol in the blood by blocking an enzyme in the liver associated with its production there is also a suggestion that statins reduce systemic inflammation and may be protective against ra and other chronic inflammatory diseases several studies have suggested a role for statins in slowing the progression of disease among patients with rheumatoid arthritis but others failed to find a protective benefit for statin use in the newly published study chodick and colleagues examined data on million members of israel s maccabi healthcare services hmo between and new cases of rheumatoid arthritis were identified in this group the analysis revealed that patients who took statins for at least eight years during the decade long study period were roughly less likely to develop rheumatoid arthritis than people who did not take statins at all or who took them less persistently a more modest reduction in osteoarthritis risk was seen in persistent statin users like rheumatoid arthritis osteoarthritis is a chronic degenerative joint disease but it is not driven by inflammation so statin use is not as likely to affect its development or progression the study appears in the september issue of the journal plos medicine,1

breast removal reduces cancer risk in some women enlarge this image toggle caption damian dovarganes ap damian dovarganes ap a new study in the journal of the american medical association shows the clearest evidence yet that women carrying the brca and brca genes should consider preventive surgery because they are at a very high risk for breast and ovarian cancers it confirms what smaller studies have suggested in the past women who have a family history of breast cancer can greatly reduce their chances of getting the disease by having a double mastectomy and if they also have their ovaries removed they can further reduce the risk of breast cancer and minimize their chances of getting ovarian cancer researchers from around the country tracked nearly women with the brca mutations who had surgery to try to prevent breast and ovarian cancer we found mastectomy provided huge risk reduction of subsequent breast cancer diagnosis and death risk reduction was probably in the range of to percent said researcher timothy rebbeck an epidemiologist at the university of pennsylvania and women who had ovaries removed reduced their risk of ovarian cancer by as much as percent the study findings are extremely reassuring to rebbeck no breast cancer diagnoses among women who had double mastectomies after three years of follow up among the women who did not have the surgery percent were later diagnosed with breast cancer rebbeck says these decreases are big but are cautions that cancer risk will never be brought down to zero that s because all the tissue is never completely taken out breast tissue is found throughout the torso and can t be completely removed through surgical means and with ovarian cancer the ovary leaves behind cells that could go on to become cancerous so it s just not possible to remove all the tissue that might be at risk he says toby s story one of the women who decided to take that chance is year old toby of new jersey because she s worried about her health coverage she doesn t want her last name used toby s mother died of ovarian cancer when toby was in her s researchers now know that disease is linked along with breast cancer to genetic mutations toby had first her ovaries and then both breasts removed after she tested positive for the brca genes about five years ago but at first she had hoped to avoid the surgery after my genetic testing they would alternate mammogram with mri every six months i thought i was getting very very good surveillance and i thought that would probably be enough and they would be able to diagnose something very very early and be able to cure me if i were to get breast cancer she says but her doctors thought otherwise breast cancer caused by brca mutations is particularly aggressive and they told toby her lifetime risk of that type of cancer was as high as percent toby was one of the women researchers from around the country tracked in the study to see how they fared after having this surgery women like toby who chose both ovary and breast removal had dramatically lower risks of getting both cancers after the surgery only percent of those who had surgery died compared with percent of those who did not during the follow up period role of genetic testing in an editorial accompanying the study virginia kaklamani an oncologist at northwestern university says lives can be saved if women have genetic testing a lot of times i see these women having had a very preventable type of breast cancer preventable because i can identify the fact that they had a higher risk of getting breast cancer she says had they been genetically tested a few years prior to my seeing them they would have had the option of having bilateral mastectomy so we could have prevented these breast cancers and we didn t says kaklamani for toby it s been about a year since her double mastectomy she s had reconstruction and today she says she feels physically strong again but she now feels an emotional empowerment and that comforts her my mother left me when i was and it was extremely painful and traumatic for my entire life she says i just didn t want to do that for my children i had a chance to control that and to fight what my mother never had a chance for oncologist kaklamani says women with the brca mutation should be counseled about genetic testing and strongly consider it while surgical decisions are up to patients the findings of this study should help them decide what to do she says toby has a daughter who decided to take the test based on her mother s experience she tested negative toby says,1
en español by madonna behen healthday reporter tuesday aug healthday news women who carry genetic mutations that boost their odds of breast and ovarian cancer can live longer and reduce their cancer risk by having preventive surgery a new study suggests the surgery in question is drastic removal of the breasts or ovaries before any signs of cancer have arisen however what our findings show is that women who choose to have these surgeries will reduce their risk of dying of breast or ovarian cancer by about to percent which is pretty profound said study senior author dr timothy rebbeck a professor of epidemiology at the university of pennsylvania school of medicine the findings are published in the sept issue of the journal of the american medical association the center trial one of the largest of its kind studied nearly women who were found to have inherited mutations in the brca or brca genes women who carry these mutations have a lifetime risk of breast cancer of anywhere between percent to percent according to the researchers whereas the risk for ovarian cancer ranges from percent to percent for brca mutation carriers and percent to percent for brca mutation carriers by contrast the lifetime risk of breast cancer among women generally is about percent and for ovarian cancer it s less than percent roughly half of the women in the study had undergone either mastectomies surgery to remove their breasts or salpingo oophorectomies surgery to remove the ovaries and fallopian tubes between and in order to proactively lower their risk of cancer the women were followed for an average of about years during the follow up period no breast cancer events occurred in the women who underwent mastectomies while percent of the women in the group who didn t undergo surgery were diagnosed with breast cancer in addition women who had their ovaries removed lowered their risk of ovarian and breast cancer and also lived longer than women who didn t have the surgery for example over years of follow up no ovarian cancer cases were seen among brca mutation carriers who underwent salpingo oophorectomy compared with percent of carriers who did not undergo the procedure the researchers report one of the main messages of our study is that salpingo oophorectomy should be part of any management plan for any woman who is found to have these genetic mutations said rebbeck there really isn t anything else that can reduce a woman s risk by this much these findings really emphasize how important it is for all women with a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer to undergo genetic testing said dr virginia kaklamani co author of an editorial that accompanied the study i see women all the time who get the genetic test only after they re diagnosed with cancer said kaklamani who is director of translational breast cancer research at the robert h lurie comprehensive cancer center of northwestern university in chicago kaklamani added that she hoped the findings would encourage more women to ask their primary care physicians whether they are candidates for genetic counseling this is a very important study because it gives us more information in order to counsel women at risk said dr daniel silver assistant professor of medicine at the dana farber cancer institute and harvard medical school silver added that women who are found to carry one of these genetic mutations face a very complex set of considerations so the more hard facts you can give them the better according to rebbeck doctors usually recommend that women who test positive for the genes have their ovaries removed at around age but are okay with putting it off until age if they haven t finished having children he said the surgery today is often done in an outpatient setting with the use of laparoscopes which limits scarring and shortens a patient s recovery time more information find out more about the brca and brca genes at the u s national cancer institute,1
chicago reuters women with mutations in the well known brca or brca genes who have their breasts and ovaries removed are much more likely to survive than women who do not get preventive surgery u s researchers said on tuesday a doctor exams mammograms in a file photo reuters eric gaillard the study shows the benefits of genetic tests that give women with a family history of cancer the chance to take steps to increase their chances of survival they said this is the first study to prove women survive longer with these preventive surgeries and shows the importance of genetic testing when there is a family history of early breast or ovarian cancer dr virginia kaklamani of northwestern university in chicago wrote in a commentary about the study published in the journal of the american medical association women with mutations in the brca or brca genes have a to percent higher risk of developing breast cancer during their lifetimes those with the brca mutation also have a to percent higher risk of ovarian cancer and those with the brca mutation have a to percent higher risk of ovarian cancer because of this many women make the difficult choice to have their breasts or ovaries and fallopian tubes surgically removed to reduce their risk dr susan m domchek of the university of pennsylvania school of medicine in philadelphia and colleagues studied the effectiveness of these procedures in women with brca mutations including women who had risk reducing surgery to remove their breasts and who had risk reducing surgery to remove their ovaries no woman who had a mastectomy developed breast cancer during the three years of follow up testing seven percent of women who decided against a mastectomy were diagnosed with breast cancer in the same period our results confirm that risk reducing mastectomy is associated with a significant reduction in breast cancer risk domchek and colleagues wrote women with brca and brca mutations who had their ovaries and fallopian tubes removed had similar results about to percent of breast and ovarian cancers are due to brca or brca genes most of these women will die of ovarian cancer so you can save percent of them with the prophylactic surgery kaklamani said and you can save the majority of women who would have died of their breast cancer she added she said primary care physicians gynecologists and women need to be more aware that these tests exist dr sandhya pruthi a breast cancer expert at the mayo clinic in rochester minnesota who counsels women with brca mutations said the study adds more evidence that the surgery can help save lives but the choice is never easy it s not cookie cutter medicine pruthi who was not involved in the study said in a telephone interview she said women need to come to terms with the psychological issues involved in having their breasts removed and younger women who have their ovaries removed must contend with early menopause symptoms it s not a decision made on a single visit she said according to the american cancer society and the international agency for research on cancer million new breast cancer cases are diagnosed around the world every year and it kills women annually making it the leading global cancer killer of women,0
chicago reuters the common diabetes drug metformin may hold promise as a way to keep smokers from developing lung cancer u s researchers said on wednesday they said metformin prevented lung tumor growth in mice exposed to a cancer causing agent found in tobacco smoke and because it is already widely used in people it may be worth further study metformin has been shown to switch on an enzyme that blocks mtor a protein that helps tobacco induced lung tumors grow a team led by dr philip dennis of the national cancer institute part of the national institutes of health studied metformin in mice exposed to a potent cancer causing agent in tobacco called nicotine derived nitrosamine ketone or nnk they treated the mice with metformin either orally or with an injection mice that got the drug orally had to percent fewer tumors while those injected with the drug had percent fewer tumors the findings were so strong the team now wants to test it in smokers to see if it can keep then from developing tumors although smoking cessation is the most important step for current smokers over half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed in former smokers raising the importance of identifying those at highest risk and identifying effective preventive treatments dennis whose findings were published in the journal cancer prevention research said in a statement other studies have shown that metformin can cut diabetics risk of pancreatic and breast cancers and the latest finding now suggests it may defend the body against smoking induced lung tumors this important laboratory study together with prior laboratory and epidemiology research suggests that metformin may be useful in cancer prevention and treatment said dr michael pollak of mcgill university in montreal who wrote a review on metformin research in the same journal the world health organization says tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death globally killing more than million people each year from heart disease cancer and lung disease the u s centers for disease control and prevention estimates that percent of u s adults smoke tobacco kills one third to one half of those who smoke,1

london reuters scientists in canada and sweden have used laboratory made biosynthetic corneas to restore vision to patients in a small human trial and shown for the first time that they can help to repair damaged eye tissue the scientists whose work was published wednesday in the science translational medicine journal said their findings offered hope for the millions of people who go blind each year because of a worldwide shortage of corneas for donation this study is the first to show that an artificially fabricated cornea can integrate with the human eye and stimulate regeneration said may griffith of the ottawa hospital research institute who led the study with further research this approach could help restore sight to millions of people who are waiting for a donated human cornea for transplantation the cornea is a tiny piece of transparent film like tissue that covers the surface of our eyes made from parallel strands of the protein collagen it refracts light to focus images on the retina although the fragile film is easily destroyed by trauma or infection replacement human corneas can be used to restore vision although this depends on a steady supply of donors a team led by griffith and per fagerholm an ophthalmology professor and eye surgeon at linkoping university in sweden conducted the study by removing diseased tissue from the corneas of patients and replacing them with biosynthetic implants designed to mimic a normal human cornea for the process they used recombinant human collagen a substance synthesized in the laboratory to mimic human tissue and supplied by the san francisco biotech firm fibrogen inc the patients were monitored for two years after surgery the researchers found that eventually the cells and nerves from nine of the patients regrew completely and packed themselves into the implant resulting in a kind of regenerated cornea that looked and functioned like normal healthy eye tissue the biosynthetic corneas also became sensitive to touch and the treated eyes began producing normal tears the researchers said vision improved in six of the patients after the patients were also fitted with contact lenses which is common after corneal transplants their vision was comparable with that of patients who undergo regular human corneal tissue transplants the results were pretty encouraging and there is great potential here fagerholm said in a telephone interview loss of vision due to corneal disease or trauma affects over million people a year but lack of access to donor tissue limits the number of transplants particularly in poorer countries in the united states an estimated corneal grafts a year are performed using tissue from posthumous donors but there are sometimes problems with rejection and experts say failure rates are significant fagerholm said the patients in this trial had no problems with rejection and did not need long term immune suppression drugs to help their bodies accept the corneas,1
researchers said they had identified a family of retroviruses in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome opening up a potentially promising new avenue of treatment for a debilitating disease that afflicts as many as four million americans and million people world wide the finding will likely spur patients with the condition to seek treatment with drugs used to fight hiv the virus that causes aids although hiv and the newly identified virus group are different they are both retroviruses the report published monday in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences was accompanied by a call for new clinical trials to test hiv drugs in patients with chronic fatigue syndrome doctors don t know what causes chronic fatigue syndrome characterized by debilitating fatigue and chronic pain with symptoms that can wax and wane over time some patients say friends co workers and even family members don t believe they are really sick studies finding a viral connection with the disease would completely transform how the illness is treated and viewed the findings also offer a potential path for treatment possibly with drugs that are already fda approved for another condition based on other recent research linking the syndrome to a retrovirus called xmrv some doctors are already prescribing drugs approved for hiv for fatigue patients the syndrome has no effective treatments yet the group of viruses identified in fatigue patients called murine leukemia virus related viruses or mlv are known to cause cancer and neurological problems in mice but whether they cause disease in humans isn t known xmrv is among several different members of the mlv family researchers said in the new study researchers said they found at least one of four different mlv like viruses in of or of patients with chronic fatigue syndrome compared with just three of or of apparently healthy blood donors monday s paper is the latest in a series of reports about a possible link between cfs and a virus interest in viruses has been intense since an october report in the journal science found xmrv in a majority of fatigue patients subsequent studies have focused on xmrv and found conflicting evidence indeed the just published study was held back from publication in june because it was at odds with a report from the centers for disease control and prevention which found no evidence of xmrv in chronic fatigue syndrome patients related slideshow the current paper didn t find xmrv either one reason it isn t likely to resolve a brewing debate over the role xmrv may play in the syndrome but researchers said the variants of mlv like viruses closely related to xmrv that they found in fatigue patients was evidence of a link between the virus family and the syndrome andrew mason a university of alberta professor co wrote the commentary in the journal calling for trials testing anti retrovirals in cfs patients who are positive for one of the mlv related viruses if the patients improve after a certain point you stop debating whether it causes the disease and say the treatment works and we re going to use it said dr mason but until scientists develop further evidence establishing that the virus causes the syndrome a large scale clinical trial testing hiv drugs against the ailment isn t likely norbert bischofberger chief scientific officer at gilead sciences inc gild the leading maker of hiv drugs said the company might consider a small pilot trial but would like to see stronger evidence that the viruses cause cfs before launching a large trial still i m very open and this would be a great opportunity he said a spokesman for merck mrk co another major manufacturer of hiv drugs said a clinical trial program would be possible to develop only after further substantial evidence of an association with cfs some doctors and patients are already testing the idea based in part on a university of utah and emory university study in cells the compounds were tested singly and then in combinations of two at a time and suggested that three anti retroviral drugs appeared to inhibit infection by xmrv jamie deckoff jones years old a doctor and cfs patient in new mexico has been blogging about her experiences and those of her year old daughter both tested positive for xmrv and are taking a combination of three anti retrovirals dr deckoff jones said a year ago she could only get up for short periods during the day after five months on the drugs she flew last week to reno for an xmrv conference her daughter was able to go to a party and is enrolling in community college this is all very new and there is no way to know if improvement will continue dr deckoff jones wrote in an email but we appear to be on an uphill course after the latest paper was held the researchers took additional steps to demonstrate that the finding was related to a retrovirus and not lab contamination eight of the fatigue patients in the study who tested positive for an mlv related virus using blood frozen years ago were asked to come back to give fresh blood seven of the eight remained positive and the virus had changed slightly over time a characteristic of a retrovirus many questions remain on why different groups are coming up with different results it is still unclear why the centers for disease control didn t find xmrv or mlv related viruses in its own study of fatigue patients at a press briefing monday steve monroe director of cdc s division of high consequence pathogens and pathology said that cdc was able to find mlv related viruses in a small number of prostate cancer patients data that isn t yet published anthony l komaroff of harvard medical school an author of the latest study said one explanation may be that the patients used in the new study were chosen because they were very sick patients in other studies are a very different group of people than the ones that knock on my door he said meantime the finding that a small fraction of healthy blood donors may be harboring mlv like virus raises new worries researchers said if confirmed and shown to reflect the presence of the virus in the broader population it could mean that tens of millions of people in the u s and more world wide are infected the implications aren t clear research has also linked xmrv to prostate cancer people diagnosed with chronic fatigue syndrome are already barred from donating blood in canada australia and new zealand out of fear a virus may be passed on through transfusions aabb a bethesda md organization whose members collect most blood donated in the u s advises that americans with fatigue syndrome not donate blood until more data are available a federally led working group is trying to determine how many blood donors may be infected write to amy

aug the plant extract resveratrol found in the skin of red grapes appears to suppress inflammation and may fight aging in humans according to a new study common food sources of resveratrol include grapes wine peanuts blueberries and cranberries study author husam ghanim phd of the university of buffalo says the popular plant extract has been shown to prolong life and reduce the rate of aging in roundworms fruit flies and yeast apparently because resveratrol affects a gene associated with longevity now ghanim and colleagues say they have found that resveratrol reduces inflammation in humans that could lead to heart disease stroke and type diabetes the researchers signed up people and put them at random into two groups one receiving a placebo and the other a supplement containing milligrams of resveratrol the volunteers took pills once a day for six weeks fasting blood samples were taken at the start of the trial and then at intervals of one three and six weeks results showed that resveratrol suppressed the generation of free radicals unstable molecules known to cause oxidative stress and release pro inflammatory substances into the blood resulting in damage to the blood vessel lining people taking resveratrol also showed suppression of the inflammatory protein tumor necrosis factor or tnf and other compounds that increase blood vessel inflammation and interfere with insulin action causing insulin resistance and the risk of developing diabetes blood samples from those on placebo showed no significant change in pro inflammatory markers,0
new york reuters health an infusion of the anesthetic ketamine can lift mood within minutes in patients suffering from severe bipolar depression according to a small study out this month in the archives of general psychiatry the patients in the study had tried an average of seven different drugs for treating their bipolar illness and were still severely depressed percent had failed electroconvulsive therapy ect or shock treatment but within minutes of receiving a ketamine injection their depressive symptoms improved the effect persisted for at least three days right now medications available for treating either major depression or bipolar illness can take weeks or even months to work notes dr carlos a zarate jr of the national institutes of health in bethesda maryland one of the researchers on the study and as a person waits for their medications to kick in he added they will continue to have difficulty working and coping with social and family life they may even be having thoughts of suicide we want to alleviate the suffering and get them back to their life he said zarate and his colleagues had previously demonstrated that ketamine shots helped some patients with treatment resistant unipolar depression meaning they did not cycle through manic episodes in the new study they gave patients with bipolar illness ketamine or a placebo on two test days two weeks apart all of the patients were on lithium or valproate two drugs commonly used for bipolar illness but had not responded to treatment nearly all were unemployed zarate and his team note and two thirds were on psychiatric disability compared to placebo patients showed significant improvement in mood within minutes of receiving the ketamine infusion using a common depression rating scale symptom improvement peaked two days after the injection but remained significantly greater than for placebo for three days seventy one percent of the patients responded to ketamine meaning they had at least a percent improvement in their depressive symptoms six percent responded to placebo side effects included anxiety feeling woozy or loopy headache and dissociative symptoms meaning a temporary sense of disconnection from reality although there were no serious adverse events by developing more specifically targeted drugs zarate noted it may be possible to treat patients effectively while avoiding these symptoms ketamine appears to work by resetting the way nerve cells process glutamate a brain chemical key for learning memory and other functions according to zarate the problem in bipolar illness and depression he explains doesn t appear to be that a person has too much or too little glutamate instead it s likely that the way their neurons release and take up the chemical is out of whack first introduced in ketamine is used legally in both human and veterinary medicine as an anesthetic it s also a drug of abuse at much higher doses than those used in zarate s research while patients in the current study received about milligrams during a minute period a dose too low to induce anesthesia recreational users of ketamine known as special k may take hundreds of milligrams per week in us regulators classified ketamine as a schedule iii controlled substance meaning it has the potential for abuse but is also useful medically ketamine could improve treatment of bipolar illness and depression in a variety of ways zarate said for example as a means to jump start standard drug treatment or as an anesthetic before ect it s opened the floodgate of many different directions of research and all of them are quite encouraging said zarate who along with a co author has filed for a patent on the use of ketamine in depression those rights would be assigned to his employer the national institutes of health efforts are already underway in europe to develop guidelines for how ketamine should be used and prescribed to treat bipolar illness and depression the researcher said in the us research is continuing on the drug he added and some physicians are likely trying the drug in their patients with bipolar illness or depression who aren t helped by standard treatments but according to zarate more research is needed on how to use the drug in the safest and most effective way source link reuters com wek n archives of general psychiatry august,1
by amanda gardner healthday reporter wednesday july healthday news drinking alcohol may help keep rheumatoid arthritis at bay possibly because it dampens the body s immune response new research suggests alcohol consumption may also protect people who already have the autoimmune disease from developing a more debilitating form this actually isn t a new concept there have been other articles stating that alcohol might be protective said dr guy fiocco assistant professor of internal medicine at texas a m health science center college of medicine and director of rheumatology at scott white in temple texas but i don t think we re going to be advocating alcohol to prevent rheumatoid arthritis nor do the study authors advise drinking as a cure for arthritis we would wish to point out that at the moment that our findings are preliminary and would not recommend that patients drink alcohol with the specific purpose of treating their arthritis said dr james maxwell lead author of the study and a consultant rheumatologist at the rotherham nhs foundation trust in england we would also remind patients to observe recommended government limits for alcohol consumption he added according to background information in the study published online july in rheumatology previous studies were mostly conducted in mice the benefit of ethanol exposure for these rodents seemed to be due to higher levels of testosterone the researchers wrote for this study the authors compared healthy participants to people with rheumatoid arthritis both of those groups were divided into four groups nondrinkers those who drank to days a month the ones who drank to days a month and those who drank more frequently we found that arthritis was progressively less severe as alcohol frequency increased with a definite difference compared to nondrinkers even in the least frequent alcohol consumption group maxwell said the teetotalers had quadruple the risk of having rheumatoid arthritis compared with those who drank in the highest category and the more often one drank the less damaging the rheumatoid arthritis tended to be including healthier joints as shown on x rays and less inflammation the association was seen in both men and women though it was stronger in males although no one can pinpoint a reason for the link with certainty essentially we think that alcohol may be having an effect by reducing the immune response which leads to joint inflammation and also that it may have a mild pain killing effect said maxwell there s a little information that alcohol can suppress the immune system added fiocco what s been reported is that people who drink excessive alcohol actually have higher levels of the cytokines that lead to the inflammation and moderate amounts of alcohol actually may lower these levels this finding is slightly different than what is reported in the current study that the severity of the disease decreased with more alcohol because the researchers assessed drinking frequency rather than the amount of alcohol consumed it is not clear how much alcohol might be helpful they said and maxwell stressed that their preliminary findings need to be replicated in the future there are limitations to any research which asks patients to report their exposure to something such as alcohol over a period of time maxwell added we would therefore recommend that a future prospective study should be performed to further assess the impact of alcohol consumption on rheumatoid arthritis a study recording alcohol consumption at the time rather than asking about it later more information the u s national institute of arthritis and musculoskeletal and skin diseases has more on rheumatoid arthritis,1
common diagnostic test may prolong low back pain toggle caption mads abildgaard istockphoto com coping with an aching back isn t easy neither is figuring out the cause of chronic back pain a lot of the time but researchers at johns hopkins suggest that a common diagnostic technique doesn t help doctors much for patients whose chronic lower back pain appears to be due to arthritis of the joints in the spine doing away with a painkilling injections or nerve blocks as a test to determine the root cause of the back pain didn t hurt patients who went on to have their pain treated by zapping nerves with electrodes skipping the diagnostic nerve blocks can save in medical costs the results appear in the august issue of anesthesiology because the diagnosis of pain can be imprecise doctors often order multiple tests before treatment in doing so they may weed out patients who would actually benefit from treatment according to the study of about patients the group that got radiofrequency treatment immediately had more people who felt better almost everyone suffering from back pain says something like i want to feel better i want to play golf again or i want to be able to play baseball with my grandkids anesthesiologist and lead author steve p cohen tells shots patients don t care much about the finer points of diagnostic accuracy they just want relief but some pain experts defend the value of the diagnostic tests dr nikolai bogdu at the newcastle bone joint institute in australia told reuters that further cost analysis is needed to account for millions of patients who might not get pain relief from the radiofrequency treatment the study s suggestion on how to manage back pain also runs counter to current guidelines from major medical groups the american chronic pain association for example says that a block test determines who should get radiofrequency treatment cohen who serves as a colonel in the u s army reserves tell us he s seen immediate treatment work on soldiers who need to quickly return to their posts so there s no reason why skipping straight to radiofrequency treatment shouldn t also work on civilian patients doctors may not change their approach anytime soon however for one thing cohen says insurance companies typically cover radiofrequency therapy only after a patient has gone through at least one diagnostic test,1
one of the most frustrating aspects of brain injuries is that they can be difficult to diagnose emergency rooms can sometimes miss subtle symptoms leading to improper treatment and potentially catastrophic consequences now researchers are close to identifying so called biomarkers that may soon make it possible to pinpoint brain injuries with a simple blood test presence of these biomarkers proteins produced by an injured brain could end up determining the future treatment of the estimated million athletes car crash victims and others in the u s who are treated for brain injuries in emergency rooms each year in addition to hundreds of thousands of soldiers injured in blasts a look at head trauma about million people annually in the u s suffer a traumatic brain injury some can lead to long term difficulties in functioning most common causes among civilians are falls car crashes and assaults blasts can cause brain injuries in soldiers about of brain injuries are concussions or mild brain injuries people in u s die from brain injuries annually and are hospitalized most commonly affected age groups are children up to years old and teens to more than million americans have long term need for help in daily tasks because of brain injury sources u s centers for disease control and prevention brain injury association of america wsj interviews the u s defense department is soon expected to provide million to fund a major study of brain injury biomarkers in more than human patients at hospitals in the u s and overseas the first of its kind study which is expected to start next year and take months will explore whether biomarkers can reliably assess the extent of brain injury and help doctors decide on treatment i think this will revolutionize brain injury care says col dallas hack a medical doctor in charge of the u s army s combat casualty treatment he says the army s goal is to one day have a portable blood test device that a medic could carry onto the battlefield doctors frequently fail to diagnose brain injury in patients who ve suffered head trauma but remain conscious physicians also sometimes can t reliably determine whether a patient in a stupor has a brain injury a stroke or something else entirely as a result doctors may incorrectly prescribe treatment or prescribe no treatment where it s actually necessary actress natasha richardson died last year after hitting her head in a snow skiing accident partly because the severity of her injury wasn t recognized quickly enough for her to get proper treatment soldiers on the battlefield can appear fine after enduring an explosion but may in fact need rest treatment or rehabilitation doctors struggle with diagnoses of brain injuries as they once did with diagnoses of heart attacks then cardiologists found troponin a cardiac biomarker that shows up in blood after a heart attack a blood test helps doctors assess within an hour or two whether a patient with chest pains is actually having an attack it s more precise than having a patient describe symptoms biomarkers could do the same for brain injury researchers are optimistic about work being done at banyan biomarkers inc a privately held start up run by former faculty members of the university of florida at the company s lab in alachua fla anesthetized rats encased in tiny body armor are hit in the head with miniature metal pistons and air blasts the blows simulate the impacts of accidents or explosions that injure the brain when the rats awaken scientists test their blood for the presence of proteins produced by an injured brain so far evidence from lab animals like these and more than human brain injury patients suggests strong correlations between the degree of brain injury and the level of certain brain biomarkers banyan hopes to win approval from the food and drug administration for a blood test if the planned clinical study being funded by the defense department proves successful edward d hall director of the university of kentucky s brain injury research program says the banyan work does show these biomarkers can reliably track brain injury and they are found in brain tissue and cerebro spinal fluid at high enough levels to be reliably detected but he said the question is whether they do this in a reliable way in mild injury cases through simple blood tests other scientists say that banyan s work may help doctors distinguish between different types of brain injury a peer reviewed study of patients led by banyan scientists and published this year in the journal critical care medicine showed that patients with the most severe brain injury had levels of a biomarker called uch l that were times the level found in patients without brain injury banyan scientists this year also published conclusions in the european journal of neuroscience that the same chemical uch l was sharply elevated in rats with injuries designed to mimic both brain injury and stroke banyan s president and founder ronald l hayes says brain injury isn t just an immediate injury but a disease process that can last for days during that time a cascade of biomarker proteins is produced in the brain suggesting damage continues to occur dr hayes and his colleagues theorize that early intervention could halt much of this later harm brain injuries are now diagnosed and assessed by checking vital signs like heart rate and blood pressure then by doctors checking the patient s thinking memory and consciousness they test basic brain functions by checking the size of pupils and how the pupils react to a bright light they administer pinpricks or other pain or heat stimuli as well as checking the patient s ability to move arms and legs ct scans are also used early detection of biomarkers could be particularly helpful at smaller hospitals where doctors might not be trained to deal with a severe brain injury if they realized through a simple blood test that they confronted a potentially devastating injury they might rush the patient to a hospital that has a neuro intensive care unit there specialists could place pressure monitors in the brain and lessen intra cranial pressure that can destroy brain tissue they also could alleviate vasospasms storms within the brain that can be just as damaging as the original injury write to thomas m burton at,1
en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter tuesday july healthday news the cancer drug avastin when used in combination with standard chemotherapy is safe and can effectively treat an advanced form of one of the most common lung cancers researchers report previously it had been thought that this combination might have serious adverse side effects including life threatening bleeding for patients with non squamous non small cell lung tumors however this phase trial which used avastin bevacizumab plus chemotherapy in a large population found these problems were minimal phase trials are done after a drug is on the market to look for any new problems today we have a new option to treat non squamous lung cancer incorporating avastin in chemotherapy regimens and in maintenance therapy said lead researcher dr lucio crino director of medical oncology at s maria della misericordia hospital in perugia italy the practical implication is the possibility to incorporate avastin with any chemotherapy regimen in the frontline therapy of metastatic non squamous lung cancer he added the report which is funded by the maker of avastin f hoffman la roche ltd is published in the july issue of the lancet oncology the funder was involved in study design coordination of data collection data analysis data interpretation and writing of the report the journal noted advanced non small cell lung cancer is a common cancer that kills million people every year worldwide according to background information in the study avastin is a so called monoclonal antibody that works by blocking vascular endothelial growth factor a which stimulates the growth of the tumor s blood supply when used as an adjunct to chemotherapy avastin had already shown cancer fighting activity in two phase trials the researchers noted for the study crino s team studied avastin in more than patients with advanced or recurrent non squamous non small cell lung cancer the patients were treated at centers in countries around the world these patients were given the drug every three weeks along with standard chemotherapy for up to six cycles patients were then treated with avastin alone until the cancer began to progress maintenance therapy the researchers reported few clinically significant adverse events meaning that most were no greater than what one would expect in the general population one percent of patients experienced bleeding in the lungs and percent had bleeding crino s group found overall percent of the patients died due to adverse events associated with avastin these included percent who had blood clots and percent who suffered bleeding other serious adverse events associated with avastin were blood clots in the lungs and nosebleeds low white blood cell counts fever along with a low white blood cell count and deep vein thrombosis dvt all of which occurred in percent of the patients dr robert pirker from the department of medicine at the medical university of vienna in austria and author of an accompanying journal editorial said that avastin can be safely given when certain precautions are taken however several issues remain to be determined including the optimal dose and the role of maintenance therapy with avastin he said in addition it is unknown whether bevacizumab avastin increases survival when added to cisplatin based chemotherapy in patients with advanced non squamous non small cell lung cancer pirker said overall avastin like several other targeted agents have led to therapeutic advances in lung cancer he added hurdles in clinical development do occur but as shown for bevacizumab can be overcome pirker said another expert dr norman h edelman chief medical officer at the american lung association and professor of preventive medicine internal medicine physiology biophysics at stony brook university in new york called the study very good bread and butter clinical research the efficacy of the drug has been proven previously he noted but this study provides an in depth analysis of avastin s safety profile under real life conditions he added too often this step is shortcircuited in the rush to market of a new drug and we have to await the laborious collection of after market data to find the real dangers of many new drugs edelman said so the researchers and sponsors are to be congratulated for doing this study they find that there are real deleterious side effects but that they are manageable and conclude the drug is worth using under the proper circumstances he said avastin is in the spotlight tuesday for another reason as well u s regulators could rescind approval of the drug for the treatment of breast cancer based on follow up studies reported friday that failed to show the medication shrank tumors or extended lives according to published reports the food and drug administration on tuesday will ask a panel of outside experts to review the evidence on the roche drug the associated press said it s possible the fda will withdraw approval of avastin as a breast cancer treatment the drug is also approved for lung colon brain and kidney cancer more information for more information on lung cancer visit the u

hate needles flu patch may take sting out of your fears in what would be a boon for needle phobes of all ages researchers have developed a skin patch that vaccinates against the flu and could be available in five years the patch which is lined with microscopic needles that dissolve into the skin could provide a painless alternative to hypodermic needles and make visits to the doctor s office or clinic for a traditional flu shot a thing of the past the patch is as easy to apply as a band aid we ve now demonstrated a technology that can enable painless self administered flu vaccination said mark prausnitz a professor in the georgia tech school of chemical and biomolecular engineering and leader in the research it appears to vaccinate against influenza at least as well and probably better than a traditional hypodermic needle vaccination that doesn t require trained personnel holds great appeal because it would likely boost the nation s low immunization rates a source of concern although influenza kills more than people most years and the government recommends most healthy people get vaccinated annually fewer than percent typically do tested on mice in a mouse study reported sunday in the online edition of nature medicine prausnitz s team found the patch improved the immune system s antibody memory and was more efficient at clearing the lungs of the flu virus compared to a placebo and hypodermic needle delivered vaccine prausnitz attributed the better performance to the skin s abundance of the types of cells most adept at generating immune responses the muscle into which needles deliver vaccine is not nearly as active immunologically patches in the mouse study contained an array of needles each some microns in length or about the width of a few strands of human hair coated with inactivated flu virus the patches are pressed manually into the skin where the microneedles dissolve into bodily fluids it s a technological approach that makes a lot of sense said dr jan drutz a general pediatrician at texas children s hospital who calls needle phobia common in both kids and adults it would be a wonderful alternative to needles if it truly works in people and is pain free fights flu better needle phobia or trypanophobia is a recognized medical condition that causes sufferers to avoid medical care it is estimated to affect more than percent of the adult population in the study one group of mice received the influenza vaccine from traditional hypodermic needles another group received the vaccine through the dissolving microneedles and a control group received the microneedle patches not containing any vaccine infected with the influenza virus days later both groups that received the vaccine remained healthy while mice in the control group contracted the flu and died three months after vaccination researchers exposed a different group of immunized mice to the flu virus and found that those who received the microneedles did better than those injected by the hypodermic needles testing on people next noting that mice are much easier to vaccinate against the flu than humans baylor college of medicine influenza expert dr paul glezen expressed skepticism about the patch until seeing it in human trials but he said it will be interesting to watch prausnitz said he hopes to be testing the patch in people in two years and have a product on the shelves in five he also said that although initially there will be start up costs he thinks the price will be no more than traditional flu vaccines once it is mass produced the microneedle technology may also be used for other vaccinations such as polio and measles said prausnitz he said his team is working on those diseases but is not as far along,1
the drug mdma better known by its street name ecstasy may be illegal but a new study suggests that it s also a promising treatment for post traumatic stress disorder the study which appears in the journal of psychopharmacology included people with ptsd stemming from traumas such as sexual assault and combat stress on two separate occasions of the people took a dose of mdma and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists the others took a placebo but received the same therapy all of the participants received additional therapy sessions that did not involve the drug two months later of the people who took mdma had improved to the point where they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for ptsd and three participants whose condition had prevented them from holding down a job were able to return to work by contrast just two of the eight people in the placebo group experienced a substantial improvement in their symptoms mdma is believed to raise levels of the feel good brain chemical serotonin and the so called bonding hormone oxytocin the resulting sense of euphoria and emotional warmth seems to help patients connect with their therapists says michael mithoefer m d the lead author of the study and a mount pleasant south carolina based psychiatrist who specializes in ptsd a lot of the time people have quite painful and challenging experiences revisiting the trauma and mdma can help them do it without being overwhelmed or numbed out he says don t try this experiment at home ecstasy use can cause depression severe anxiety and potential cognitive problems according to the national institute on drug abuse and when purchased on the street it can be contaminated conducting a study with an illegal drug is a complex process this was the first clinical trial to explore the therapeutic potential of mdma since the drug was outlawed in and the researchers required the permission of the national institutes of health the food and drug administration and the drug enforcement administration it took quite a bit of time to get approval mithoefer says the study was funded by the multidisciplinary association for psychedelic studies a california based nonprofit organization that also sponsors research on medical marijuana and psychedelic drugs such as lsd and psilocybin the use of mdma in psychotherapy has been studied for decades but research in the u s all but ground to a halt after the drug became illegal mithoefer and his team are now gearing up for a similar study involving combat veterans which is scheduled to begin later this year,1

by amanda gardner healthday reporter tuesday july healthday news a leading group of cancer experts has issued new guidelines on the best way to use two classes of hormone therapies for estrogen receptor positive breast cancer the most common form of breast tumor after a systematic review of medical research on the subject experts reported that adding an aromatase inhibitor a drug that reduces the amount of estrogen produced in the body has clearly been shown to reduce the number of tumor recurrences in postmenopausal women compared with the standard drug tamoxifen which works by blocking the action of estrogen on cancer tumors that are estrogen receptor positive the committee preparing the guidelines recommended therefore that all postmenopausal women with this type of breast cancer use aromatase inhibitors either before or after tamoxifen they also concluded that women could use them as long as five years after tamoxifen therapy to lower their risk that the cancer will reoccur the paper issued by the american society of clinical oncologists asco and published july in the journal of clinical oncology essentially brings guidelines in alignment with today s practice this is actually reinforcing clinical practice said dr crystal denlinger assistant professor of medical oncology at fox chase cancer center in philadelphia in general for postmenopausal women we are offering them aromatase inhibitors based on the single studies that have been referenced in these guidelines and what has already been reported in national meetings those studies and presentations added denlinger have uniformly demonstrated the superiority of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen or a switching strategy or an extended strategy the new guidelines replace previous guidelines issued in and subsequent updates in and tamoxifen has been a mainstay of treatment for decades while aromatase inhibitors are a more recent entry into the field both drugs are used as adjuvant therapy meaning they are used after surgery and chemotherapy and or radiation to prevent the cancer from coming back the committee reviewed recent studies which had investigated aromatase inhibitors and or tamoxifen in women with this particular subtype of breast cancer using an aromatase inhibitor alone or with tamoxifen therapy improved disease free survival compared with using tamoxifen alone it also reduced the risk of the cancer spreading to other parts of the body women who are pre or peri menopausal when they are diagnosed should be given tamoxifen for five years aromatase inhibitors are not effective in this age group the experts note all three aromatase inhibitors on the market arimidex anastrozole femara letrozole and aromasin exemestane were essentially equal in their benefit the drugs can also cause side effects that need to be taken into account when prescribing we ve learned a huge amount about the various side effect profiles of these products said dr harold j burstein co chair of the asco committee which prepared the guidelines and associate professor of medicine at harvard medical school and dana farber cancer institute in boston aromatase inhibitors are clearly associated with osteoporosis and with bone and joint conditions they might also be associated with a greater risk of hypertension and high cholesterol for its part tamoxifen is also associated with serious side effects which can include cataracts and uterine cancer as well as life threatening blood clots and stroke and cost will also be a factor in decision making aromatase inhibitors are very expensive and sometimes we have to make decisions about using drugs that are probably a little less effective but at the same time we have to take into account the financial standpoint said dr jay brooks chairman of hematology oncology at ochsner health system in baton rouge are aromatase inhibitors better than tamoxifen yes in two areas preventing recurrent disease in other parts of the body and in preventing a second separate breast cancer but the financial costs are much more expensive according to the new guidelines milligrams of tamoxifen costs a month while arimidex can cost on the other hand burstein pointed out the aromatase inhibitor anastrozole recently became available as a generic which should lower the cost significantly more information read the full guideline at the american society of clinical oncology,1
steve horrell spl getty images a cholesterol home test a new study finds that current guidelines for cholesterol screening in children may miss nearly of those who have high levels of ldl or bad cholesterol the question of how soon children should be screened for high cholesterol is becoming increasingly important in the u s with its rate of child obesity topping along with obesity high levels of blood fats can lead to heart disease and other health problems including diabetes the u s government currently recommends screening for high cholesterol in children with a family history of heart disease or high cholesterol with at least one parent or grandparent who has suffered a premature heart event such as heart attack or stroke or at least one parent with total cholesterol levels above mg dl the guidelines also recommend that youngsters whose parents are not aware of their family history of heart disease be screened see how to prevent illness at any age in the new study led by dr william neal of west virginia university scientists observed a group of more than fifth graders in west virginia and found that were eligible for cholesterol screening based on national criteria experts believe using family history is a good way to identify children who may be at greatest risk of high cholesterol and therefore of future heart disease based on the results of the screen doctors may then advise families to change their children s diet or exercise routines or prescribe medication to lower their cholesterol but because west virginia has one of the nation s highest rates of death from heart disease since the state has offered free universal cholesterol screening to all fifth graders enrolled in public schools that allowed neal and his team to determine how many children who actually had high cholesterol would have been missed if they had been screened based on federal guidelines see time s special report on how to live years among the children who would not have been screened nearly had elevated ldl cholesterol levels above mg dl according to the study published in the august issue of pediatrics and had levels high enough above mg dl to warrant cholesterol lowering medications indeed of all the children in the study whose ldl levels were above one third were in the group who would not have been screened the current guidelines were put in place in the s and at the time experts predicted that high cholesterol would be missed in as many as of children says neal but doctors assumed that in most cases these children would have only slightly elevated cholesterol levels that would eventually be detected when they became adults and would be lowered with diet and exercise neal s data show that may not be the case further neal says the findings apply not only to heart disease risk but also to the risk of diabetes since high cholesterol at a young age is a strong predictor of prediabetes and diabetes we worry about that because if these children don t change their ways then they are going to have type diabetes he says it s something we would become more aware of if more children were screened not everyone agrees that universal screening is the answer rather than calling for all youngsters to have their cholesterol tested which would entail considerable expense on the national level dr ralph sacco president of the american heart association aha suggests looking more critically at current screening guidelines maybe the way we are doing family screening with a very simplistic questionnaire about any parent having early heart disease or having high blood cholesterol is not effective he says i think we need more effective screening tools we need to assess these options before jumping to possible universal screening sacco notes that both the aha and the american academy of pediatrics now recommend cholesterol screening in children with risk factors for heart disease other than family history such as obesity high blood pressure and diabetes the weight of the child his waist circumference and whether he has siblings who are overweight would help to select a group that is at greater risk of having high cholesterol he says now that we have this data it does call into question these original guidelines from the government the next update of the recommendations is expected in spring see time s pictures of the week,1
back in april the wsj wrote about the race to develop ways of detecting alzheimer s disease using a brain scan currently only a post mortem sampling of brain tissue can provide a definitive diagnosis but the hope is that a technology that could be used in living patients could help rule out alzheimer s in some patients and for those that have the disease allow its symptoms to be treated more quickly the progress of the disease itself cannot be slowed the general idea is to inject a compound into a patient containing molecules that bind to the amyloid plaques that are characteristic of alzheimer s because the compound also contains a radioactive marker it makes plaques visible on a pet scan now there s good news about one of the technologies the wsj has written about a compound called florbetapir developed by avid radiopharmaceuticals a study abstract released at a meeting of alzheimer s researchers shows a strong association between the results of those brain scans and the actual location of plaques determined after death bloomberg news reports another study presented at the conference looked at people with mild cognitive impairment which can precede alzheimer s it found that of patients with plaques identified using florbetapir vs of those without plaques progressed to full blown alzheimer s within a year bloomberg reports avid s ceo told bloomberg the company would apply for fda approval of the compound this year as the wsj reported earlier the alzheimer s diagnostic and biomarker market is expected to reach billion in up from billion last year bayer and ge are also developing diagnostic compounds to be used in tandem with imaging photo associated press,1

en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter wednesday june healthday news adding to the ongoing debate on the usefulness of the prostate specific antigen psa blood test for prostate cancer new research from sweden finds the screen cuts lives lost to the disease by almost half the argument over whether psa screening saves men s lives or merely leads to the overdiagnosis of very slow growing cancers with attendant worry and overtreatment has bedeviled the medical world for years according to recently revised guidelines from the american cancer society men at average risk for prostate cancer should discuss the psa test with their doctor starting at age for men at high risk for the disease blacks and men who have a father brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age before that discussion should start at age because prostate cancer grows slowly those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit the society notes on its web site ambivalence over the test hasn t been confined to the united states in europe we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get psa testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge agreed lead researcher dr jonas hugosson a professor of urology at the university of gothenburg however he believes that with the results of the new year study it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of about psa and its possibilities personally i would recommend my friends check their psa hugosson added the report is published in the june online edition of the lancet oncology for the still ongoing study hugosson randomly assigned some men to either psa screening once every two years or no screening the men were between and at the start of the study men whose psa levels were above normal were offered more tests such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies over years of follow up deaths from prostate cancer dropped by percent among the screened men compared with unscreened men the researchers found overall of the men who had psa testing died from prostate cancer compared to men who had not had been screened among screened men percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer compared with percent of unscreened men of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer nearly percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study the researchers noted in addition men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage in the screened group men were diagnosed with advanced cancer compared with men in the unscreened group hugosson s team found our study has a longer follow up than previous studies but shows that in those men invited to the study the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group in men younger than at study entry the effect was even more pronounced only one quarter of expected deaths occurred hugosson said moreover the risk of over diagnosis was less than previously thought with just men needed to be diagnosed to save one life however since the benefit of psa screening requires at least years to be borne out it still seems questionable to test psa for men over the researchers noted dr david e neal a professor of surgical oncology at the university of cambridge in the u k and author of an accompanying editorial believes that psa testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms by doing so it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease this study adds to previous evidence that psa testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives he said still the psa test remains a blunt instrument when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor neal said we need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease he said in the united states psa testing remains a routine part of most physical exams according to dr nelson neal stone a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the mount sinai school of medicine in new york city i would say to percent of physicians now order a psa test he said so it is more or less the standard to care in america to get a psa done stone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers which do not need to be treated when we see patients with low risk disease we don t treat them we observe them he said younger men benefit most from screening because they have the greatest risk of dying stone said this study clearly supports psa screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths another expert dr anthony d amico chief of radiation oncology at brigham and women s hospital in boston added that people in good health will benefit from psa screening but people in poor health may not benefit at all that s because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other more serious conditions he explained more information for more information on prostate cancer visit the american cancer society,1

june cholesterol lowering statin drugs appear to reduce the risk for prostate cancer recurrence in patients who have had a surgical procedure called radical prostatectomy in a new study from duke university medical center men who took statins for their hearts were less likely to have their cancers come back after their prostates were removed than men who did not take the drugs those who took the highest doses saw their recurrence risk drop by half the research does not prove that taking cholesterol lowering drugs directly slows the growth and progression of prostate cancer but the fact that the fewest recurrences were seen in men who took the highest statin doses is compelling says senior investigator stephen j freedland md of the duke prostate center statin users may see their doctors more often and may be more health conscious in general and it has been suggested that this could explain the observed reduction in risk freedland tells webmd if this is the case dosage shouldn t matter but that is not what we found,1
en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter sunday june healthday news new research suggests that artificial pancreas technology can help diabetics gain greater blood sugar control overnight even when they have eaten a big meal or had wine for dinner the promise of this emerging technology is to free diabetics from the need to constantly monitor their blood sugar levels by letting a computer program do the job constantly adjusting glucose and insulin levels as needed using this technology is still seen as a stopgap however while a biological solution to diabetes is sought we have pioneered the development of a closed loop artificial pancreas because we believe it will significantly impact the lives of individuals with both type and type diabetes by providing exquisite control of blood sugar dr richard a insel executive vice president for research at the juvenile diabetes research foundation jdrf said during a noon teleconference saturday a symposium on advances in the technology co sponsored by the american diabetes association and the jdrf is slated for sunday as part of the american diabetes association s annual meeting in orlando fla for people with type diabetes controlling their blood sugar levels is a full time job too much insulin can cause low blood sugar hypoglycemia which can be life threatening while too little causes the serious damage of diabetes such as kidney vision and circulation problems the promise in the near term of these technologies is not only to help us reduce significantly the risk of long term diabetic complications but also to reduce the risk of having a catastrophic hypoglycemic event and further help people with diabetes live easier aaron kowalski research director of the jdrf s artificial pancreas project said during the teleconference this will help keep people healthy while we drive toward a biological approach which will take longer he said in the first report dr roman hovorka a principal research associate in the department of pediatrics at the university of cambridge reported that the technology can significantly improve overnight blood sugar control in adults without the fear of developing hypoglycemia with the technology patients maintained their blood sugar levels within the target range for percent of the time compared to percent of the time among those not using the technology moreover glucose control was demonstrated in real life situations such as after a large meal and having a glass of white wine we let them consume about three quarters of a bottle of wine to simulate what happens after a large meal hovorka said during saturday s teleconference what has been shown is that drinking alcohol in the evening causes hypoglycemia early in the morning these results were similar to findings in children where the system extended the amount of time spent at target blood sugar levels he added we reduced hypoglycemia by half he said our plan is to move into home studies which hopefully will happen later on this year hovorka said meanwhile marilyn ritholz a senior psychologist at the joslin diabetes center and an assistant professor of psychology at the harvard medical school reported on a study on psychological barriers to continuous blood sugar monitoring so far studies have not shown which factors predict which factors are associated with successful or unsuccessful continuous glucose monitoring cgm she said during the teleconference ritholz s team found that people who were better at coping with the frustration of using the device were more successful at keeping their blood sugar under control frustrations included warning alarms and problems at the insertion point of the device we found that the people who did well used a more problem solving approach and persisted in trying to learn how to use the cgm she said people who were not successful used emotion based coping ritholz said they easily became overwhelmed and they just gave up in addition successful people had more involvement and support from their spouse or significant other she added all patients felt self conscious wearing the device ritholz noted we know that cgm success or failure is as dependent on the human experience as it is on the perfection of the technology she said speaking at the saturday teleconference dr william tamborlane chief of pediatric endocrinology at yale university school of medicine and co chair of the juvenile diabetes research foundation s continuous glucose monitoring group said the system only works if worn almost every day studies have shown that children and adults over who used cgm were able to reduce their blood sugar levels however teenagers did not see a benefit probably because they were less likely to wear the device tamborlane said people who used the device more than six days per week saw improvement regardless of age he added to get more people to use cgm the industry needs to come up with better systems and better devices he said artificial pancreas technology combines cgm with an insulin pump and a sophisticated computer program that controls when and how much insulin to deliver the device delivers two hormones that are deficient in type diabetes insulin which keeps blood sugar levels from going too high after a meal and glucagon a naturally occurring hormone that prevents blood sugar levels from dropping too low however the complicated computer algorithm for the pump system is still being developed more information for more information on type diabetes visit the american diabetes

london reuters iranian scientists say they have developed a way of using a simple blood test to predict accurately when women will reach the menopause offering the chance for women to plan for family and career far in advance the test which measures levels of a hormone produced by cells in the ovaries was able to predict the age at which women reached menopause to within an average of months according to data to be presented at the conference of the european society of human reproduction and embryology in rome on monday the results could enable us to make a more realistic assessment of women s reproductive status many years before they reach menopause said ramezani tehrani of the shahid beheshti university of medical sciences in tehran who led the study experts commenting on the work agreed it was promising but said its findings would need to be confirmed in larger trials the possibility of an accurate predictor for menopause is very exciting people have been looking for something like this for years said dagan wells of the nuffield department of obstetrics and gynaecology at oxford university the average age for menopause is with ovulation in most women ending sometime between age and but it can happen later or earlier making it difficult for women who want to develop a career before having babies to know how long to wait tehrani s team took blood samples from women aged between and who were also taking part in another study called the tehran lipid and glucose study which started in they then measured concentrations of a hormone called the anti mullerian hormone amh that is produced by cells in women s ovaries amh controls the development of follicles in the ovaries from which eggs develop and the scientists suspected it might be useful for judging ovarian function statistical model the researchers took two more blood samples at three yearly intervals and also collected information on the women s socioeconomic background and reproductive history we developed a statistical model for estimating the age at menopause from a single measurement of amh concentration tehrani explained in a report on the study using this model we estimated mean average ages at menopause for women at different time points in their reproductive life span tehrani said the results showed a good level of agreement between predicted and actual age at menopause for the women in the group who reached menopause during the study the average difference between the predicted age and the women s actual age at menopause was a third of a year and the maximum margin of error was three to four years wells said tehrani s team appeared to have hit upon a fairly accurate algorithm for predicting menopause but said it would be important to see if the method could also help predict the time when fertility effectively ends a woman may cease monthly ovulation and experience menopause at but she will probably have been effectively infertile for several years prior to this he said it will be important to let patients know that fertility will have declined greatly in the years preceding the final ovulation,1
ever since alzheimer s disease was described by a german doctor alois alzheimer in there was only one way to know for sure that a person had it a pathologist examining the brain after death would see microscopic black freckles plaque sticking to brain slices like barnacles without plaque a person with memory loss did not have the disease there is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of alzheimer s but every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work particularly if they are started early the questions though are who should be getting the drugs and who really has alzheimer s or is developing it even at the best medical centers doctors often are wrong twenty percent of people with dementia a loss of memory and intellectual functions who received a diagnosis of alzheimer s did not have it there was no plaque when their brains were biopsied half with milder memory loss thought to be on their way to alzheimer s do not get the disease and with such a high rate of misdiagnosis some who are mistakenly told that they have alzheimer s are not treated for conditions like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions that are causing their memory problems brain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions who has or is getting alzheimer s whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death dr skovronsky thought he had a way to make scans work he and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque they labeled the dye with a commonly used radioactive tracer and used a pet scanner to directly see plaque in a living person s brain but the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested and that is what brought dr skovronsky a thin and eager looking year old to his e mail that recent day five years ago dr skovronsky who named his company avid in part because that is what he is had taken a big personal and professional gamble he left academia and formed avid radiopharmaceuticals based in philadelphia to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with hospice patients to prove it worked advertisement continue reading the main story hospice patients were going to die soon and so he reasoned why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see some patients would be demented others not some predicted his study would be impossible if not unethical but the f d a said it wanted proof that the plaque on pet scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy photo the avid study was designed to provide that proof and the full results contained in the e mail message sent that day may were the moment of truth when he saw them dr skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for this is about as good as it gets he said that day he went into a rotunda that serves as avid s lunchroom to tell the company s employees this is a big day for us he continued i thought about what i would say but i have totally forgotten it his employees applauded then they had champagne in blue plastic cups a first dye the type of scans used in this study pet scans are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center get injected with a radioactive dye wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan other tests are being studied ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain mri scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning pet scans that look for uptake of glucose a cellular fuel to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not the tests though were not necessarily specific for alzheimer s and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy earlier this decade two scientists at the university of pittsburgh developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain the researchers chester mathis and william klunk began their work two decades ago persevering even though they had no research money in the first years they tested more than compounds when they finally found one that seemed promising they tested more than variations advertisement continue reading the main story on and on it went dr mathis said finally in late they began working with collaborators in sweden to test their dye in humans on valentine s day the swedish researchers injected the first alzheimer s patient with the dye known as pittsburgh compound b and scanned the patient s brain it worked the swedish doctors told dr mathis in an excited phone call a pet scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected the swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque they told dr mathis it was time to celebrate newsletter sign up

s two weeks later he got another call from sweden his colleagues had scanned a person without alzheimer s there was no sign of telltale plaques his sweet reward came in july when the scans were shown to an audience of scientists at an international conference on alzheimer s there was an audible gasp dr mathis said the field was taken aback the rest is history he added yet there was a problem pittsburgh compound b used carbon as its radioactive tracer and its half life is minutes researchers have to make it in a cyclotron in the basement of a medical center quickly attach it to the dye dash over to a patient lying in a scanner and inject it and a critical question remained was a pet scan with the pittsburgh dye really equivalent to a brain autopsy meanwhile others including dr skovronsky had another idea use fluorine with a half life of about two hours it could be made in the morning and used that afternoon and fluorine is made routinely for two million cancer pet scans each year photo dr skovronsky starting at the university of pennsylvania and then at avid worked with a university of pennsylvania chemist hank kung for nine years to find and develop the radioactive dye the university had the patent avid licensed it finally on june a patient at johns hopkins had a scan with their compound plaque lit up advertisement continue reading the main story most of the time the scans were as expected those with alzheimer s had lots of plaque those with normal memories had little if any and those with mild memory impairment were in between but about percent of people over with normal memories had plaque then we looked more carefully dr skovronsky said the percent who had amyloid though they were still statistically in the normal range did worse on every memory test than the control group what dr skovronsky asked did that mean were they starting to develop alzheimer s if so could dementia be stalled if there were drugs to stop amyloid from accumulating the definition of alzheimer s is plaque plus memory loss and other symptoms of mental decline but what is not known because no one could follow the development of plaque before a person died was whether people with plaque and normal memories were developing alzheimer s we ve always assumed the pathology has been there that the plaque has been there years before symptoms said dr steven t dekosky an alzheimer s researcher who is vice president and dean at the university of virginia school of medicine but we never had a way to detect plaque in living persons he said and so plaque in the brains of people with normal memories has been a puzzle over the next couple of years we will find out what it means a request of the dying on oct avid and two other companies bayer and general electric that are developing fluorine based dyes for amyloid scans got a pointed question from an advisory committee to the f d a how do you know that what you are seeing on scans is the same as the amyloid you see on autopsy it seemed impossible to answer if researchers wait for their subjects to die before comparing scans with autopsies they can be waiting a long time advertisement continue reading the main story but avid had a plan and the committee agreed in principle that it would work hospice patients would be study subjects some with dementia some without all would have memory tests and brain scans after death their brains would be autopsied avid suggested that after the first died there should be enough data to know if the scans gave a true picture of the pathology then the f d a could decide if the results were convincing enough to approve the dye for marketing some doctors had misgivings wondering how they could ask people who were sick and dying to be scanned just to help alzheimer s research but they found most patients and their families agreed and said they were grateful to have been asked that was evident on may when dr skovronsky gave a lunch for patients families in sun city ariz to thank them for participating they thanked him it really touched my heart to be in this said dorothy wall whose husband claude e wall died of liver cancer in sun city on march something bad happens and now something good happens answers late last year avid saw the initial results of its hospice study data from the first six patients then as more patients were studied the data from them were held by a company that would analyze it avid did not see the results until the study was completed but those first six were encouraging a man diagnosed with alzheimer s and cancer had a scan showing no plaque his autopsy did not show it either the diagnosis was wrong another man with parkinson s disease and dementia had been diagnosed as having dementia solely due to parkinson s his scan showed amyloid so did the autopsy he had alzheimer s a woman with mild memory loss had a scan showing no amyloid her autopsy also found none three others had clinical diagnoses of alzheimer s

cnn losing interest in sex would be unfortunate for most people but for linda poelzl it was a professional hazard i just wasn t feeling much interest in sex and this was very disturbing to me says poelzl who lives and works in san francisco i have to have a certain amount of interest in it because of my work poelzl s describes her work as a sex educator and coach helping men women and couples work through their sexual problems she says she usually possesses a great lust for lust but then her libido started dissipating a few years ago when she was in her late s shocked and not quite sure what to do she turned to medical doctors and found there wasn t much they could offer as there s no prescription medicine like viagra to help a woman when her sex life gets stuck the greatest hope for a so called female viagra was a drug called flibanserin but it was nixed by a panel of food and drug administration experts on friday who said the drug didn t seem to really help women with sexual dysfunction this was the second time a so called female viagra failed to make it on the market in an fda panel said no to intrinsa a testosterone patch meant to hormonally help women with a lack of desire for sex given these two rejections it could be a while before another pharmaceutical company decides to sink money into developing a new drug for women with sexual problems one company biosante pharmaceuticals hopes to bring a testosterone gel to the market in but there aren t many other products on the horizon there hasn t been much action in this area and that certainly has to come up when a company is thinking about dumping money into researching a drug for female sexual dysfunction says phyllis greenberger president of the society for women s health research which received money from boehringer ingelheim the company that makes flibanserin that s despite a seeming need for such medication in a survey of more than u s women in the journal obstetrics gynecology found that nearly percent reported that they d had a sexual problem at some point in their lives most often a lack of desire after seeing medical doctors but getting few results poelzl decided to take another route she visited alternative practitioners and began experimenting with taoist exercises used in chinese medicine she practiced six minutes of exercises every morning such as sitting quietly in a chair massaging her lower abdomen while there s no hard science that shows that taoist practices will improve a woman s sex life poelzl says it worked for her i noticed i started feeling more energy in my body and more libido she says but it took at least six weeks of almost daily practice you have to be committed in fact for nearly all alternative practices there are no large scale studies saying if they work or not but in the absence of a drug to help women with sexual problems here s what s recommended by some practitioners acupuncture jill blakeway a licensed acupuncturist who practices in new york city started out doing acupuncture to help women get pregnant but then a few years later she started noticing something interesting after having a couple of kids patients were coming back to me and saying i just never feel like it anymore blakeway says she then developed a specialty in acupuncture to help women lift their flagging libidos she says acupuncture like viagra increases blood flow to the genitals but unlike viagra it usually takes four to six weeks to see results if your sexuality has been lying dormant for a while then it s going to take a while to wake it up blakeway says and when it does wake up i tell women not to see this as goal oriented orgasmic sex but rather as a way of connecting to their partner one of blakeway s patients wrote an article for the magazine cookie

june drinking lots of coffee probably isn t entirely good for you but it does lower your risk of mouth and throat cancer that s probably not what university of milan researchers carlotta galeone scd phd and colleagues thought they d find when they analyzed nine studies comparing people with head and neck cancer to people without cancer but the numbers came out this way people who drink more than four cups of coffee each day have lower odds of getting mouth or throat cancer compared to people who don t drink coffee the protection was seen for oral and pharyngeal cancer but not for cancer of the larynx drinking less than five cups of coffee a day had a smaller but statistically significant protective effect about lower odds of mouth and throat cancer for each cup drunk daily was it the caffeine probably not though there weren t enough data on decaf drinkers to draw conclusions drinking tea even massive quantities was not protective galeone and colleagues note that coffee contains more than a thousand chemicals some such as cafestol and kahweol have anti cancer properties but whether these substances actually protect against cancer in humans is a question for future studies most head and neck cancers are linked to alcohol consumption and to smoking interestingly the protective effect of coffee was not diminished in drinkers and smokers nor was the effect boosted by consumption of fruits and vegetables also shown to protect against head and neck cancers galeone and colleagues report their findings in the july issue of cancer epidemiology biomarkers prevention,0
they are part of a new wave of smart implantable devices that is transforming the care of people with heart disease and creating a bonanza for researchers the hope is that the devices now being tested in clinical trials will save lives reduce medical expenses and nudge heart patients toward managing their symptoms much the way people with diabetes manage theirs patients who often are frail or live far from their doctors can be spared frequent office visits doctors can learn immediately if devices are malfunctioning or if patients hearts are starting to fail it s like having an office visit every day and a complete physical every week said dr leslie saxon a cardiologist at the university of southern california the big leap forward came a few years ago when device companies figured out how to make transmitters that send data over a broader range or feet that meant that with her device mrs elzo did not have to wait till her doctor could put a receiver directly on her chest instead she simply went near a small box which is attached to a phone jack near her bed once a week she also measures her weight and blood pressure key indicators of heart failure and that information is automatically transmitted to her doctor if there are problems the machine alerts her doctor now every single day the device is being queried said her doctor james coman of the heart rhythm institute in tulsa it s just a phenomenal tool there is a downside though information overload is a very serious problem for the doctors said dr lynne warner stevenson director of the heart failure program at brigham and women s hospital in boston and a professor at harvard medical school who counts herself as a proponent of smart devices more information she warned is not always beneficial the devices transmit useful data along with data whose significance is not clear like variations in heart rate large swings in heart rate can indicate risk but it is not clear what to do about them even more confusing are changes in thoracic impedance a measurement of resistance to electric current through the lung impedance changes can predict future heart crises but more often have no clinical explanation yet when doctors get data on impedance changes they often feel uneasy and call patients to see how they are making patients uneasy in turn dr stevenson said advertisement continue reading the main story dr stevenson likened such information to the game of jeopardy doctors are given answers in search of a question it s a challenge even for the nation s heart failure specialists but it can be even harder for primary care doctors who have less expertise in heart failure yet care for most of the six million patients in the country with the condition dr richard page president of the heart rhythm society said doctors wonder if they can be held liable if they do not look at all the data still he said the new technology is potentially transformative for researchers the information deluge leads to a different problem how to analyze the data a large clinical trial of a cardiac device used to involve maybe patients now boston scientific a maker of one of the smart heart devices is following patients no one has ever done research like this before said dr saxon who leads an independent team of academic scientists overseeing boston scientific research the company has no editorial control over the papers the scientists write dr saxon said boston scientific gets data from patients defibrillators it also gets information on deaths from medicare the data are stripped of patient identifiers and analyzed a task requiring the company to become more like a google or a microsoft handling enormous amounts of information there are for example more than four million recordings of weights and blood pressures and over instances when the defibrillators went off shocking a patient s heart so far dr saxon s group has reported on the first patients half of them had not been enrolled for remote monitoring and served as a control group photo patients whose doctors looked at the data survived to percent longer than patients in earlier clinical trials of the devices dr saxon reported and in a paper under review the group reports that their three year survival was significantly greater than that of patients in the study whose doctors did not see the data advertisement continue reading the main story other researchers will be analyzing economic data the devices can cost as much as do patients with defibrillators make up for some of that expense with fewer hospitalizations or doctor visits a study using a similar device made by medtronic suggests that is the case the medtronic study directed by dr george crossley president of st thomas heart at baptist hospital in nashville involved patients randomly assigned to receive a defibrillator that transmitted data or a device that did not transmit those with the nontransmitting device were seen in their doctor s

devices transmitted spent less time on average in the hospital when they were admitted days compared with days and their hospital costs were less per admission the plausible reason we think is that we got to these people much sooner in the course of their illness dr crossley said we think we did not let the people in the remote sensing group get into heart failure still the information overload problem looms one solution being tested by st jude medical a medical device company in st paul is to let patients deal with important data the idea said dr neal eigler a senior vice president at st jude is to get heart patients to adjust their medications regularly based on readings of their heart s functioning just as patients with diabetes adjust their insulin based on blood glucose readings patients hold a small device over their chest twice a day and if they experience symptoms like shortness of breath it transmits readings of blood pressure in the left atrium the upper left chamber of the heart if pressure in that chamber gets too high the lungs can fill with fluid doctors preprogram the hand held device to provide instructions to patients in response to their left atrial pressure measurements telling them for example to take a different dose of a medication restrict fluid intake increase their activity level or call the clinic if successful the smart device could have a big effect one million patients a year are hospitalized for heart failure ninety percent of the time it is because fluid has accumulated in their lungs advertisement continue reading the main story dr stevenson who has no connection with st jude is intrigued patients can see what is happening to their own bodies and act accordingly they have to strictly limit salt in their diet for example and seeing their left atrial pressure might be motivating a patient might say maybe my pressure is higher because that pizza i had for dinner last night had a lot of salt dr stevenson said as a more positive incentive the device can also instruct patients to decrease their medications if they are doing well st jude recently completed a small study of patients and is starting a large clinical trial in the pilot study the device reduced the frequency of high atrial pressure readings by two thirds and the number of hospitalizations by percent over five months meanwhile patients whose doctors can deal with the data stream from smart devices say they are getting peace of mind they include people like danielle denlein who to her total shock developed a serious heart problem on october at p m ms denlein was driving to a drug store to buy formula for her day old baby girl suddenly she felt a pain in her chest she thought it was heartburn then it began radiating down her arm i just knew i don t know how i knew but i knew i was having a heart attack she said although she was only her main coronary artery had ripped open a rare complication associated with pregnancy advertisement continue reading the main story ms denlein now relies on her smart defibrillator to save her from her injured heart and to alert her doctor dr saxon to problems if they occur it s life changing ms denlein said it gives me such a feeling of comfort mrs elzo feels the same way had her device not alerted her doctor that it needed to be replaced she said i shudder to think what would have happened,1
washington reuters an experimental drug being developed to fight influenza may fight a common but little known virus called parainfluenza virus researchers and the company said on friday tests in rats showed fludase made by privately held nexbio could stop parainfluenza viruses from replicating the researchers reported in the journal of infectious diseases dr anne moscona of weill cornell medical center in new york and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug also known as das in lab dishes and on cotton rats a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza therapies for parainfluenza are urgently needed moscona an expert on parainfluenza viruses said in a statement development of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines for human parainfluenza virus has lagged far behind influenza despite the recognized impact of these diseases in children and adults particularly the elderly immunocompromised and patients with underlying airway disease parainfluenza viruses are not closely related to flu but belong to another family of viruses called paramyxoviruses they cause most cases of croup and can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis an inflammation of the small air passages in the lungs there is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza fludase is already in phase clinical trials for use against influenza adding parainfluenza to its approved indications would provide a unique and potentially large market for san diego based nexbio parainfluenza uses the same receptors molecular doorways to infect cells as flu does fludase inactivates these receptors the researchers said that means patients with flu like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza there were some weaknesses in the study the rats were pre treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza and infection in rats does not follow the same disease course as in humans moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals a spokesman for nexbio david wurtman said the company would seek food and drug administration approval to test fludase in people with parainfluenza because fludase affects the human cells that viruses infect not the virus itself it is less likely to cause the virus to develop resistance the company believes influenza viruses have already developed widespread resistance to three commonly used flu drugs amantadine rimantadine and roche ag and gilead sciences inc s tamiflu a fourth drug glaxosmithkline s and biota inc s relenza works by the same mechanism as tamiflu,1
washington reuters a new longer lasting morning after pill to prevent unwanted pregnancy appears to work with no unexpected side effects u s health regulatory staff said in documents released on tuesday data shows the one pill treatment called ella and made by french drugmaker hra pharma is effective when taken as many as five days after unprotected sex food and drug administration staff reviewers said in documents released ahead of a public meeting on the drug scheduled for thursday at the meeting an fda panel of outside experts will decide whether to recommend the agency approve the emergency contraceptive for the u s market if approved watson pharmaceuticals inc would sell the drug in the united states hra pharma s drug approved last year in europe under the name ellaone has re ignited debate over morning after pills in the united states where reproductive issues are a constant political issue women s health advocates have welcomed the potential for another contraceptive option but some critics contend the drug is more akin to the abortion pill sold by danco laboratories as mifeprex and also known as ru or mifepristone teva pharmaceutical industries ltd sells a rival product called plan b a two pill regimen with generic competition from watson s next choice teva also sells a one pill version of plan b both versions of plan b which are available over the counter for women at least years of age have only been proven to work for up to hours after intercourse there is a medical need for an efficient emergency contraceptive product which acts consistently over a prolonged time period hra pharma said in a separate document released by the fda the drugmaker has said its pill also known by its chemical name ulipristal works primarily by preventing ovulation of a woman s egg but the drug s effect on the lining of the uterus critical for a fertilized egg to develop may also play a role according to its label in europe fda staff scientists in their review concurred the agency s reviewers also said the company s studies showed no unexpected side effects in women although reports of nausea headache and abdominal pain were common it was not clear what effect the drug had if any when a woman still became pregnant despite taking it they added data on pregnancy outcomes after ec emergency contraceptive failure with ulipristal were too limited to draw any definitive conclusions regarding the effect of ulipristal on an established pregnancy or fetal development they wrote more leeway emergency contraceptive pills have been available in the united states for more than a decade plan b or levonorgestrel was first approved in efforts in to make it available without a prescription stirred fierce opposition from conservatives and the bid stalled under the george w bush administration democrats angered by the delay threatened to block bush s nominee to run the fda easier access to the drug won approval in hra is not seeking to sell ella without a doctor s prescription advocates for women s health have applauded the possibility of additional contraceptive options saying a longer lasting product could help women who want to avoid pregnancy for ella while you re going to have to go and get a prescription for it it gives you a little bit more leeway in terms of putting your ability to put your life on hold and get this healthcare need taken care of said amy allina program and policy director for the national women s health network cost is also an issue with plan b sold over the counter most women have to pay for the drug themselves roughly rather than have their health insurance cover it allina said anti abortion groups oppose hra pharma s drug saying it is closer chemically to mifepristone than plan b and pressing the fda to reject the product like mifepristone ella is a type of drug known as a selective progesterone receptor modulator sprm that interferes with the hormone progesterone which is critical for pregnancy if it is approved it should be clearly labeled as an abortifacient which would limit its distribution the american association of pro life obstetricians gynecologists said in a letter to the fda earlier this month there is no doubt that ulipristal acts an abortifacient because the drug blocks progesterone receptors at three critical areas an action that interferes with the hormone action of progesterone to prepare the endometrium for implantation and to support the early pregnancy the group wrote proponents agree that ella is similar chemically to mifepristone but say the dose given does not interfere with a pregnancy already underway there s just no evidence that it causes abortion said baylor college of medicine professor paul fine who also serves as medical director for planned parenthood in houston and southeast texas on thursday the fda s advisers will weigh hra pharma s data and offer recommendations before the agency later makes its approval decision

new york reuters health robots may not help doctors do a better job on some surgeries according to a new study surgeons treating women with endometriosis a chronic condition that affects more than million women and adolescent girls in the u s didn t get better or faster results when they used a robotic system with the surgeon alone the incision is smaller and the manipulations are more controlled dr ceana nezhat an author on the study and the chair of obstetrics gynecology at northside hospital in atlanta told reuters health because the robot lets the surgeon get a better picture of the inside of the body the authors had expected that surgeries using the robot would go more smoothly than those without it to test this idea they looked back at minor surgeries that were done on women with endometriosis half using the assistance of a robot half without it there was no difference in how much blood patients lost and there were no complications in either group but robotic surgeries took longer than non robotic surgeries by about minutes hours and minutes compared to hours and minutes on average longer surgeries often mean a more tired surgeon and more chances for things to go wrong the robot surgeon team might not have outperformed the surgeon alone because the procedure was a relatively simple one surgical robots do not operate on their own rather surgeons move electronic instruments that are linked to the movement of other instruments inside the body while they watch a three dimensional image of what s going on inside one robot can cost around million we were surprised that surgery with the robot did not have better outcomes than the surgeon alone as we have always believed if you can see more and see better you can do more and do better the authors write however they suggest that more complicated procedures for severe endometriosis which might require open surgery would benefit from the help of a robot inexperienced doctors might also take advantage of the robot for surgery if they don t think they have the skills to do the surgery with only a small cut dr nezhat said in this case the robot could turn what would have to be an open surgery into a simpler one dr tommaso falcone chair of obstetrics and gynecology at cleveland clinic said this study shows that more technology is not always better using a robot for basic surgery like the kind studied here would be like using a computer to do addition he told reuters health i just need a calculator to add a few things said falcone who was not involved in the study yes it s true that if i ve got that supercomputer maybe it looks better but all i need to do is add and especially in a time of concern over rising medical costs we should not simply use the highly sophisticated technology just because it s there falcone said source here fertility and sterility online may,1
francesco tonelli for the new york times next time you order takeout wonton soup and a spicy number you might want to make sure it comes with brown rice brown rice is a whole grain white rice before it has been refined and polished and stripped of the bran covering which is high in fiber and nutrients brown rice also has a lower glycemic index than white rice which means it doesn t cause blood glucose levels to rise as rapidly now a new study from researchers at harvard reports that americans who eat two or more servings of brown rice a week reduce their risk of developing type diabetes by about percent compared to people who eat it less than once a month and those who eat white rice on a regular basis five or more times a week are almost percent more likely to develop type diabetes than those who eat it less than once a month just replacing a third of a serving of white rice with brown each day could reduce one s risk of type diabetes by percent a statistical analysis showed a serving is half a cup of cooked rice the study which was published in the archives of internal medicine and used data from two harvard nurses health studies and a separate study of health professionals isn t the first to point a finger at foods like white rice as a culprit in type diabetes a study of chinese women in shanghai found that middle aged women who ate large amounts of white rice and other refined carbohydrates were also at increased risk for diabetes compared to their peers who ate less but the harvard study is one of the first to distinguish between brown rice and white rice consumption in the united states where rice is not a staple food and relatively little is eaten overall said dr qi sun an instructor in medicine at brigham and women s hospital which is affiliated with harvard medical school many food studies simply lump brown and white rice together the bottom line is we showed evidence that increased consumption of white rice even at this low level of intake is still associated with increased risk said dr sun who was at the harvard school of public health when the study was done it s really recommended to replace white rice with the same amount of brown rice or other whole grains the researchers who did the study analyzed rice consumption among men and women who participated in the health professionals follow up study and the nurses health study i and ii participants in the three groups ranged in age from to they had filled out food frequency questionnaires when the studies started in and respectively and updated their diet information every four years subsequently through and they were also asked about their medical histories during the course of the studies more than participants developed type diabetes such food studies can be unreliable since they rely on self reported surveys and correlation does not necessarily mean a cause and effect relationship since factors other than brown rice consumption may have accounted for the decreased diabetes risk that was observed the researchers tried to control for the fact that americans who eat brown rice tend to be more healthy overall they eat more fruits and vegetables and less red meat and trans fats and they also tend to be thinner more active and less likely to smoke than those who don t eat brown rice but dr sun said there were many possible explanations for why brown rice eaters are at lower risk for type diabetes in addition to having a lower glycemic index than white rice brown rice also contains important nutrients like magnesium that are stripped during the refining process it also contains much more fiber earlier studies have found that having these nutrients in the diet protects against diabetes dr sun said correction an earlier version of this story misidentified the amount of cooked rice in a serving a serving is one quarter cup of uncooked rice or about half a cup when cooked,1

washington reuters a urine test can help doctors better spot prostate cancer than either the current blood test or a rectal exam alone u s researchers reported on tuesday they said gen probe s progensa pca test caught about half the actual cases of prostate cancer in men who had abnormal psa levels or digital rectal exams and had about a percent false positive rate that s pretty good actually said dr david crawford of the university of colorado school of medicine who helped lead the study trying to diagnose prostate cancer is one of the most maddening tasks a doctor has the prostate is a walnut shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to digital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer a blood test for prostate specific antigen or psa shows when psa rises but psa goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate or even if the gland is inflamed such as from an infection biopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate missing any tumors entirely and prostate tumors can grow slowly a study last year estimated that more than million men in the united states alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them the progensa test looks for a genetic material called pca it is a string of rna that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed or overactive in prostate cancer lightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test crawford and colleagues tested progensa in about men who had high psa readings an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies it reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer crawford said if you had no cancer your pca was at or if you had precursors such as high grade pin prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia your score was about to and men who had cancer scored about to the test had a specificity of percent meaning that percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did this compares to just percent for psa alone the researchers told a meeting of the american urological association in san francisco if the pca is abnormal above about you have got an percent chance of having cancer crawford said the test had a sensitivity of percent meaning it correctly identified percent of cancers this is far less sensitive than psa which catches percent of tumors but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation among the men studied percent turned out to have prostate cancer the test was approved for use in europe in but is not yet approved in the united states,1

thursday may healthday news a new approach to treating irregular heartbeats appears to have demonstrated success in halting abnormal electrical pulses in both patients and pigs new research indicates in essence the new intervention known as visually guided laser balloon catheter enables doctors to much more accurately target the so called misfiring cells that emit the irregular electrical impulses that can cause an erratic heartbeat in fact with this new approach the study team found that physicians could destroy such cells with percent accuracy this they said is due to the procedure s use of a slender medical device called an endoscope which when inserted into the target region provides a continuous real time image of the culprit cells the traditional means for getting at misfiring cells relies on pre intervention x rays for a much less precise snapshot form of visual guidance the findings are reported by study author dr vivek y reddy a senior faculty member in medicine and cardiology at the mount sinai medical center in new york city and colleagues in the may online edition of circulation arrhythmia and electrophysiology about million americans currently live with an irregular heartbeat condition known as atrial fibrillation among individuals over the age of it is the most common serious form of heart rhythm irregularities according to background information in a news release from the american heart association atrial fibrillation accounts for between percent and percent of all ischemic strokes with stroke risk rising fivefold among patients with the condition as compared to healthy men and women the release noted the current study focused on patients percent men all of whom were diagnosed with a form of atrial fibrillation all had already undergone at least one failed drug regimen reddy s team used the new procedure to successfully blast all the targeted misfiring cells in each patient s pulmonary veins which transport blood from the lungs to the heart the investigators found that after just one laser treatment misfiring ceased in percent of the treated veins and percent remained inactive three months after treatment the researchers achieved similar results in work with pigs whose heart closely resembles the structure of the human heart more information for more on irregular heartbeats visit the u s national library of medicine,0
en español tuesday may healthday news giving certain breast cancer patients estrogen lowering drugs before surgery enhances their chances of being able to choose a breast conserving lumpectomy instead of a full mastectomy new research suggests the observation was based on a national study launched at hospitals across the united states it focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor positive er breast cancer that was either at stage ii or stage iii that is tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm the most common form of breast cancer er accounts for about three quarters of all breast cancer cases in the united states the authors noted the women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a week regimen of aromatase inhibitors estrogen lowering agents before any surgery estrogen stimulates the growth of er tumors the women were classified into three groups as the study began marginal meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations mastectomy only meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible and inoperable meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer after the four months of estrogen lowering therapy the research team found that percent of those women in the marginal group were in fact able to undergo successful breast conservation surgery more than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome and percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast conservation surgery the investigation was funded by the american college of surgeons oncology group and led by dr julie a margenthaler an assistant professor of surgery and a breast surgeon at the siteman cancer center at washington university in st louis aromatase inhibitor therapy shrank the tumors in many of these women and improved surgical outcomes study chair dr matthey j ellis a breast cancer specialist at washington university and barnes jewish hospital said in a news release these results will encourage a change in practice across the country so that more women can benefit from the currently underutilized approach of administering estrogen lowering agents before surgery the findings are scheduled to be presented june at the american society of clinical oncology annual meeting in chicago more information for more on surgical options for breast cancer visit the u s national cancer institute,0

chicago reuters an experimental cancer drug showed early promise at helping patients with advanced melanoma that had spread to the brain according to a summary of data from a mid stage study bristol myers squibb s closely watched biotechnology drug ipilimumab which enlists the help of the immune system to attack tumors was found generally safe and showed signs that it was working on tumors in the brain which are especially difficult to treat the study is the first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain and the findings released in an abstract or brief summary support its potential use in these patients the researchers said the abstract was one of thousands of studies released on thursday ahead of presentation at the american society of clinical oncology asco next month in chicago ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody an engineered human immune system protein that boosts the body s immune response by interfering with another immune compound called ctla which acts as a sort of brake on immune system cells by temporarily removing this brake the hope is to unleash the immune system to find and destroy the cancer results of a late stage study of the drug in melanoma patients will be detailed in a late breaker session at asco s annual meeting in june in the phase trial researchers said four out of patients with at least one brain lesion had a partial response to the drug and in out of patients both brain and other tumors in the body stabilized after weeks of treatment the responses lasted from three to months and patients had no serious toxic side effects data from a second arm of the study is still being evaluated a separate study of the drug also showed signs it could work in people who first appeared not to respond to the drug researchers reintroduced the drug to patients who were initially treated as part of a study of patients eight of the got ipilimumab alone got ipilimumab plus a vaccine called gp and one got the vaccine alone all of the treatments appeared safe the team found that in patients whose cancer initially progressed while on ipilimumab whose who were reintroduced to the drug had a disease control rate of to percent compared to zero in the patient who got the vaccine only these findings may have implications for the use of ipilimumab therapy in the long term management of advanced melanoma the researchers reported in the abstract melanoma accounts for about percent of skin cancer cases but causes most skin cancer deaths and doctors have few effective treatments to offer once the disease has spread according to the american cancer society melanoma accounted for more than cases of skin cancer in and deaths,1
by amanda gardner healthday reporter wednesday may healthday news researchers hope that a simple brain scan performed in infants and toddlers can presage the development of autism leading to early detection and early intervention the test involved using functional mri to measure brain responses to spoken words in sleeping children we re focusing on this earliest time period when the brain is still developing and still changing explained study author lisa eyler an assistant professor of psychiatry at the university of california san diego if we could use this with other markers we could probably identify people early on and if we could do that we d have a much better chance of helping to make sure that their language development is normal the finding is slated to be presented wednesday at the international meeting for autism research in philadelphia but another expert pointed out that the study is still extremely preliminary it s a very early study they have a long way to go before they re actually able to implement a test like this said keith young vice chairman of research in psychiatry and behavioral science at the texas a m health science center college of medicine in temple before bringing it to clinics researchers need to make sure this test isn t detecting other developmental delays such as dyslexia he noted i wouldn t want to be telling people your kid has autism when the problem is that they re dyslexic young said and when it is ready for prime time it probably won t be applicable to all children with autism this is probably not going to be used for wide scale screening but it could be used for children who we have some sense that they have autism and want to gather more information said david amaral president of the international society for autism research and research director of the university of california davis mind institute there are many many different types of autism there are some children with autism who don t have these specific abnormalities in brain function right now experts have little to go by in detecting autism other than carefully monitoring the regular developmental milestones in children young said we do need something he said one of the hallmark features of autism is deficits in language acquisition eyler explained whereas the typical developing kid will have an explosion of their language ability starting at about months in both comprehension and production kids in autism delay don t start comprehending or producing until later and they don t ever have that kind of explosion about percent of kids with autism never develop language she noted we were interested in what was going on in the earliest period of life that could account for these differences she continued for this study eyler and her colleagues monitored the brain activity of children with an autism spectrum disorder aged months to months and typical children of roughly the same age children slept in the mri machine while researchers read them bedtime stories this allowed the investigators to see which parts of the brain were being activated in typical children versus children with autism we were looking for areas of the brain that are more responsive during listening to bedtime stories than when they re not hearing that eyler said in the typically developing children both sides of the brain involved in language processing were activated in the youngest children the activation was about equal in both the right and left hemisphere while in the older children activity became more pronounced on the left side which is similar to adult patterns and to be expected eyler explained but in the autistic children there was slightly more right hemisphere response than left hemisphere and there was no change in activity across the age range we didn t see that growth of the left hemisphere in the children with autism eyler said we now feel pretty confident that in many children with autism there are alterations either in structure growth or connectivity of the brain but we really don t understand the implications of that for core features of autism one of which is problems with communication amaral said this provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain more information the autism society of america has more on this disorder,1

varicose veins are a result of weak stretched out vein walls veins contain valves that when stretched no longer keep blood moving back toward the heart efficiently risk factors include genetics age and standing still for prolonged periods eighty seven percent of people with varicose veins do not seek treatment according to a survey of roughly adults conducted nationwide by vein clinics of america and opinion research corporation but doctors say they should these veins are not just a cosmetic problem but can also lead to aches pain swelling and heaviness from blood pooling in the legs the treatment known as sclerotherapy an alternative to surgery entails injecting a solution to irritate and collapse vein walls so the vein eventually disappears a series of sessions is usually required for a large area vein specialists across the country often inject one of two drugs one sodium tetradecyl sulfate or sts has long been f d a approved the other polidocanol had not been legal although some doctors used it importing it from abroad or obtaining it from pharmacies that make drug compounds you have some legal exposure by doing so said dr morrison a vein specialist in greater phoenix photo that said polidocanol was the second most commonly used sclerosing agent because he said most physicians want to give their patients the best available treatment f d a approval of polidocanol should benefit patients several ways often the concentrations of polidocanol from compounding pharmacies were wrong and had lots of contaminants that could damage the skin where injected according to dr robert a weiss a baltimore dermatologist who directs the maryland laser skin and vein institute by contrast he said by e mail asclera is very safe for skin an injector s experience

will mind it ms brought said her legs used to have very nasty veins and her calves hurt she is still due for treatments so some veins remain visible but they are no longer raised she now wears sundresses instead of just selling them in her boardwalk shop some vein specialists use liquid irritants like sts or polidocanol to make an injectable foam that targets larger varicose veins why a sudsy foam will fill up the vein come into full contact with the lining of the vein wall whereas liquid works for very small veins only said dr nisha bunke a vein specialist she said veins as large as a sharpie marker can be tackled with foam sclerotherapy but the f d a considers a foam version of sts or polidocanol to be a different product from the liquid so injecting it is an off label use dr min said in an e mail message that foam sclerotherapy was very safe but that it is associated with higher risks than liquid sclerotherapy foam injections have been blamed as the cause of blood clots in leg veins he wrote adding that one known stroke may have been caused by foam sclerotherapy but foam sclerotherapy has been a big relief for some patients judson emerick an art history professor at pomona college in claremont calif had varicose veins so troublesome that he kept getting skin ulcers that failed to heal plus his legs looked like a sack of walnuts he said after a series of

if authenticated in further larger trials the results could also become a landmark in the field of autism research since scientists speculated that the drug may help some patients with autism not caused by fragile x perhaps becoming the first medicine to address autism s core symptoms one child in five thousand is born with fragile x syndrome with mental effects ranging from mild learning disabilities to retardation so profound that sufferers do not speak and physical effects that include elongated faces prominent jaws big ears and enlarged testes it mostly affects boys and earned its name because under a microscope one arm of the x chromosome seems nearly broken with part hanging by a thread the gene for fragile x was discovered in work since then has found that fragile x patients seem to experience an overload of unchecked synaptic noise synapses being the junctions between brain neurons the novartis drug and others like it are intended to lower the volume of this noise so memory formation and high level thinking can take place allowing children to develop normally the novartis trial which began in in europe with data analysis completed this year was too brief to observe effects on basic intelligence instead researchers measured a range of aberrant behaviors like hyperactivity repetitive motions social withdrawal and inappropriate speech they gave one set of patients the drug and another a placebo and after a few weeks switched treatments with both doctors and patients unaware of which pill was which the results of the trial were something of a jumble until novartis scientists noticed that patients who had a particular undisclosed biological trait improved far more than others the bottom line is that we showed clear improvements in behavior dr fishman said told of the results two parents of a fragile x patient were euphoric this is what we have been working for and hoping for since our son was diagnosed with fragile x years ago said katie clapp president and co founder of the fraxa research foundation a nonprofit organization dedicated to financing fragile x research this may be the key to solving the mystery of autism and other developmental disorders geraldine dawson chief science officer at autism speaks the world s largest autism advocacy organization said that a growing body of research suggests that the many genetic causes of autism all seem to affect synapses suggesting that a treatment for one form of the disease might help others photo the exciting thing about these results is that it is our hope that these same medications may have similar positive benefits for people with autism who don t have fragile x syndrome dr dawson said advertisement continue reading the main story between percent and percent of autism cases result from fragile x syndrome or some other known genetic defect while fragile x is the most common inherited cause of mental retardation down syndrome which also causes retardation is more common but is not inherited the novartis trial results were not published or peer reviewed and for commercial reasons dr fishman refused to divulge many details dr luca santarelli head of neuroscience at roche confirmed that roche is in the midst of testing a similar medicine in fragile x patients at four sites in the united states so far we like what we see dr santarelli said in his only characterization of their study one reason for the euphoria surrounding the novartis trial is that it was seen as an especially difficult test of the drug s effects for ethical reasons novartis tested the drug only in adults but the company and outside researchers believe that such compounds may prove most effective in young children whose brains are far more likely to respond rapidly when barriers to learning are removed this is perhaps the most promising therapeutic discovery ever for a gene based behavioral disease said dr edward m scolnick former research chief at merck and now director of the stanley center for psychiatric research at the broad institute at harvard and the massachusetts institute of technology dr scolnick has not seen the results of the novartis trial but was told of them and concluded that if the drugs work in fragile x there s nothing to say that they won t work in some cases of broader autism spectrum disorders an unlikely beginning the roots for the novartis results began in when stephen t warren then a graduate student in genetics at michigan state university was looking for a job and something to research a friend told him about fragile x and with the same reflection he might use to pick a novel for a long flight he decided that he wanted to find the gene that caused it i had no idea how hard this would be dr warren said nine years later dr warren then at emory university was part of an international team that won a fierce competition by isolating the gene the discovery was front page news around the world and experts predicted

the predictions were premature because like most of genetic research discovering how the flawed gene caused disease was far harder than anticipated and required multiple leaps in neurology and biology and even with those much remains mysterious advertisement continue reading the main story fragile x is caused by a genetic stutter in which a portion of the gene gets repeated like a scratched album with each subsequent generation the number of repeats tends to rise so if a mother has repeats her child might have or for reasons that are not well understood however this process of repeat amplification can suddenly go haywire so mothers who have or more repeats tend to have children with hundreds in anyone with or more repeats the body shuts off the gene since genes are used to make proteins this genetic silencing means the encoded protein is never made the absence of this protein in cells causes the wide ranging effects of fragile x syndrome those with to repeats are considered carriers and recent research shows they can have severe neurological declines late in life that mimic alzheimer s and parkinson s many geneticists would have moved on to other research topics after finding a disorder s underlying gene but dr warren met affected children and their parents instead of family pictures dr warren s desk displays a framed photo of a fragile x chromosome i could not imagine telling someone like katie clapp that we were not going to pursue this research anymore he said photo so he kept on years of work by him and others found that the protein missing in those with fragile x normally seems to act as a sort of traffic cop at brain synapses helping to stop or slow brain signaling at crucial intervals it does this by sopping up the genetic instructions needed to produce proteins that encourage brain signaling regulating this flow of electronic pulses across the brain is crucial for the brain s ability to learn and mature dr warren was puzzling over how to recreate that synaptic traffic cop when because of a scheduling conflict he showed up in at the wrong scientific conference and happened to sit next to mark f bear a neuroscience professor at m i t who had just given a presentation about compounds that seemed to work in synapses to speed the creation of proteins including the one missing in fragile x patients the two got to talking and decided to collaborate they found that if dr bear reverse engineered his compounds they seemed to slow brain transmissions instead of a traffic cop the brain would get speed bumps not ideal but perhaps adequate in lowering the synaptic noise enough to encourage learning and the moderation of the kind of synaptic traffic jams that in fragile x children can lead to seizures sure enough mice fish and fruit flies that through genetic engineering were made to have fragile x seemed to become normal when given dr bear s compound the novartis compound is a member of the same drug family advertisement continue reading the main story we have been promising for a long time that unlocking the molecular basis for hereditary diseases would lead to dramatic therapeutic advances and that promise is finally coming true said dr francis s collins director of the national institutes of health in discussing the science leading up to the trial but it has not been easy a search for treatment a hundred years ago katie clapp would have died giving birth to andy her child with fragile x andy s head was too big to get out without a c section he would have killed me and that would have taken care of the fragile x gene she said but ms clapp and andy did survive and despite going to some of the best hospitals in the country four years would pass before andy s condition was properly diagnosed when a doctor finally thought to do a fragile x test ms clapp and her husband dr michael tranfaglia both harvard graduates with post graduate degrees researched the disease and came to two conclusions fragile x was potentially treatable and only about five researchers in the world were working toward a cure and i thought what if all five walk across the street at the same time and get hit by a mack truck ms clapp said that is not going to get us there so the two started the fraxa research foundation remarkably their efforts seem to be paying off and may finally offer hope not only to those who with fragile x but to carriers like andy s sister laura i ve always known my kids have a chance of having it laura said in a recent visit to the family s house but i m not going to have kids for at least years anyway and they ll have a cure for by then she paused looked at her mother and said you ve got years,1

en español by ed edelson healthday reporter monday april healthday news an updated version of the standard prostate cancer test can help improve predictions about which men might not require immediate treatment researchers report the basic test measures blood levels of prostate specific androgen psa a protein produced by prostate gland cells but the standard psa test cannot distinguish between cancers that grow so slowly they can safely be left alone and aggressive life threatening tumors that call for surgery or radiation therapy the new test measures blood levels of three different types of psa combined with annual biopsies or tissue samples it was about percent accurate in singling out the aggressive tumors in a small study john hopkins university researchers were to report sunday at the american association for cancer research annual meeting in washington d c what we have shown is that using the prostate health index and tissue dna measurement is informative in separating out patients whose cancers are likely to progress vs those that are not likely to progress said study leader robert w veltri an associate professor of urology and oncology at hopkins prostate health index is the name given to the test by beckman coulter inc which plans to market it the study included men originally diagnosed as having small low grade and low stage prostate cancer the kind whose ultimate aggressiveness is often in doubt currently identifying the dangerous tumors in that group is no better than a coin flip veltri said and as a result many men and their doctors choose treatment that might be unnecessary and can cause impotence and other major problems men in the trial had periodic blood tests that measured three different forms of psa including pro psa a molecule in which two of the amino acids that make up the protein have been clipped off it is the pro psa level that is most valuable as a predictor veltri said but it is only one part of the study the new psa test is given twice a year along with a digital rectal exam to determine the size of the tumor and a yearly biopsy the regimen found unfavorable indications for of the cancers meaning progression of cancer grade or tumor size and favorable for the others veltri said when you combine the dna reading and the serum prostate health index it is accurate in about out of cases he said but it was a small study and it will take another year or two to get enough cases to nail down the predictive index veltri said the hopkins group is trying to identify other biomarkers that would improve the program s predictive value he said one hope is that the now annual biopsies could be done every other year veltri said the study results have caused excitement he said through active surveillance we can identify a set of prostate cancer patients with low grade tumors that may be able to have intervention deferred or delayed veltri said the hopkins work was described as outstanding by dr william j catalona director of the prostate cancer program at northwestern memorial hospital s robert h lurie comprehensive cancer center who pioneered the use of the standard psa test and helped develop the new version of the test the test is awaiting approval by the u s food and drug administration and already is approved for use in europe catalona said in a study of men in the chicago area we found it to be more accurate than the tests now available and it also seems to identify the more aggressive prostate cancers he said another report at the same meeting described use of a microchip to detect tumor cells in the blood of people with prostate cancer the presence of circulating cells can indicate spread of the cancer to other parts of the body but they are so rare that they are invisible to current technology the new circulating tumor cell ctc chip identified such cells in nearly half of people with early stage prostate cancer and in two thirds of people with advanced cancer providing important prognostic information researchers at massachusetts general hospital reported more information learn about diagnosis and treatment of prostate cancer from the u s national cancer institute,1

tuesday april healthday news researchers report they ve used magnets to guide stem cells to damaged areas of animal hearts the strategy appears to make it more likely that the heart will retain the cells potentially boosting the power of cardiac stem cell therapy stem cell therapies show great promise as a treatment for heart injuries but hours after infusion we found that less than percent of the stem cells remain in the injured area dr eduardo marban director of the cedars sinai heart institute in los angeles said in a news release from the institute once injected into a patient s artery many stem cells are lost due to the combination of tissue blood flow which can wash out stem cells and cardiac contraction which can squeeze out stem cells we needed to find a way to guide more of the cells directly to the area of the heart that we want to heal marban and colleagues developed a technique in which they loaded cardiac stem cells with microscopic bits of iron then they injected the cells into rats that had heart attacks and tried to manipulate the cells with a toy magnet the researchers found that magnetism attracted the stem cells to injured areas tripling the retention rate in the heart tissue viability is enhanced and heart function is greater with magnetic targeting marban said this remarkably simple method could easily be coupled with current stem cell treatments to enhance their effectiveness marban and his wife linda are founders of a company that has filed patents for the techniques the study was published online april in the journal circulation research more information the u s national library of medicine has more on heart disease,0

en español by ed edelson healthday reporter wednesday march healthday news a thyroid derived cholesterol lowering drug that could be an alternative to the widely used statin medications has done well in a small early trial swedish and american researchers report in the trial various doses of the drug eprotirome a laboratory engineered version of thyroid hormone were added to statin treatment for people whose high levels of ldl cholesterol had not been lowered by previous use of statins the combination did lower cholesterol levels in the week trial and most importantly did not cause the feared side effects on the heart and other organs that have plagued similar thyroid based treatments there was no doubt that eprotirome would lower ldl cholesterol thyroid hormone is nature s own statin said dr paul w ladenson a professor of endocrinology and metabolism at the johns hopkins university school of medicine and lead author of a report on the trial published in the march issue of the new england journal of medicine but this is a demonstration of lipid lowering effect without thyroid toxicity dr bo angelin a professor of clinical metabolic research at the karolinska institute in stockholm where the drug was developed said that the trial demonstrated that careful targeting of the drug s effect within the body could obtain the benefits of thyroid hormone on blood cholesterol levels without causing damaging side effects the trial was funded in part by karo bio a small commercial spinoff of the institute we knew that thyroid hormone could lower lipid cholesterol levels but would have side effects on the circulation and bones and cause diarrhea angelin said even if the lipid levels were ok it would be overall negative for patients however he added if we can get the thyroid effect in the liver where cholesterol is metabolized but not in other organs we would be ok frequent monitoring showed no ill effects on the hearts and bones of those taking the drug the report said and though statins are widely used and most often successful an alternative to them would be welcome ladenson said statins are not effective in up to a quarter of potential users because of unacceptable muscle pain or simple failure to lower cholesterol levels he said the first importance of the trial is that it shows hepatic liver targeting of hormonal action ladenson said the second exciting part is its impact on lipids other than ldl cholesterol though statins lower ldl bad cholesterol they have no effect on other blood fats such as lipoprotein a which is believed to be equally damaging ladenson said he said that significant reductions of blood levels of those fats were seen in the trial larger and longer studies are needed to determine whether eprotirome will have the hoped for effect on blood fat levels without side effects and will ultimately reduce the risk of heart attacks and other cardiovascular diseases both ladenson and angelin said adding that such trials now are in the planning stages at best results would not be available for at least two to three years angelin said if eprotirome does pass all the anticipated tests successfully its use at first probably would be in combination with a statin angelin said use as a single drug treatment for elevated cholesterol levels could follow first in selected patients then more widely he said it s best to move cautiously agreed dr robert m califf vice chancellor for clinical research at duke university the effects on ldl cholesterol and lipoproteins are pretty exciting califf said but if there is one thing we ve learned about drugs in this arena it s that we need large trials to see how they measure up in terms of risk and benefit the trial s researchers were careful to list indications of possible harmful side effects such as a reduction in levels of hdl good cholesterol califf said but he echoed the thought that a longer term and larger test is needed to determine the incidence of some possible major side effects such as impotence i m not sure i d want to sign up for that one before i had longer term results califf said being impotent is no fun more information the american heart association has more on cholesterol lowering drugs,1

feb acupuncture may be an effective way to reduce depression during pregnancy a new study shows many pregnant women who have symptoms of depression worry that taking antidepressants might harm their unborn babies so they stop taking their medications say researchers at the stanford university school of medicine acupuncture might be a useful alternative they say because a study of pregnant women shows that the procedure works in reducing depressive symptoms better than other non pharmacological techniques the study included pregnant women diagnosed with major depressive disorder some received depression specific acupuncture treatments others had needles inserted in acupuncture points not known to relieve depression and a third group received massage therapy all of the women received therapy for eight weeks and were interviewed at the four and eight week marks by someone who did not know which treatment they were getting the researchers say of the women who received depression specific acupuncture reported a significant reduction in symptoms compared to of women in the other two groups combined remission rates were not significantly lower in the depression specific acupuncture group compared to the other two groups i hope that people will respect the rigorous methodology used in this blinded randomized controlled trial and accept the result study researcher deirdre lyell md assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at stanford university school of medicine says in a news release given that so many depressed women are reluctant to take antidepressants during pregnancy it s important to find an alternative study researcher rachel manber phd professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at stanford says in the news release lyell says treatment of depression during pregnancy is critically important so that a woman can maintain her sense of well being and take good care of herself her fetus and someday her child the researchers say up to of pregnant women may suffer from depression the study is published in the march issue of obstetrics gynecology,0
en español by ellin holohan healthday reporter wednesday feb healthday news regular use of ibuprofen a common anti inflammatory drug significantly lowers the risk for developing parkinson s disease harvard researchers report people who took three or more tablets a week showed a percent lower risk than those who didn t take the common pain reliever their study found study author dr xiang gao an instructor and epidemiologist at harvard medical school and brigham and women s hospital in boston said the findings are important for anyone at increased risk for parkinson s because most people with the disease eventually become severely disabled there is thus a need for better preventive interventions gao said in this context our findings regarding the potential neuroprotective effect of ibuprofen one of the most commonly used analgesics on parkinson s disease may have important public health and clinical implications parkinson s is a disease that affects nerve cells in the brain that control the movement of muscles it affects an estimated million people in the united states men far more often than women the exact cause is unknown but experts believe it s a combination of genetic and environmental factors gao said that though the drug levodopa is the current standard treatment for parkinson s much more is needed he is scheduled to present the findings in toronto at the annual meeting of the american academy of neurology in april the findings came from an analysis of data on people who did not have parkinson s at the start of the study in a six year span were diagnosed with the disease those who took the largest doses of ibuprofen were less likely to have developed parkinson s than were those who took smaller amounts of the drug the study found no other pain reliever was found to lower the risk for parkinson s dr michele tagliati an associate professor of neurology and director of the parkinson s disease center at the mount sinai school of medicine in new york city described the results as somewhat surprising and said they emphasized the need for further study it s intriguing that the finding applied to just ibuprofen and not aspirin or acetaminophen or other commonly prescribed medications for inflammation because it implies something more specific to ibuprofen that should be investigated tagliati said so it narrows the focus to a subgroup of anti inflammatory drugs tagliati called the study eye opening parkinson s is not considered an inflammatory disease he said adding we might be missing something there is more work to be done but in the meantime tagliati said he would definitely discuss ibuprofen use with his patients because if it works to protect against the disease it could very well benefit those who already have it he cautioned that persistent use of ibuprofen can lead to gastritis or inflammation of the stomach lining but said that in comparison there is very little to lose when measuring its side effects against the effects of parkinson s which can include loss of balance stiffness hallucinations and dementia more information the national parkinson s foundation has more on parkinson s disease,1
a nasal spray containing a hormone that is known to make women more maternal and men less shy apparently can help those with autism make eye contact and interact better with others according to a provocative study released monday the study involving adults with either a high functioning form of autism or asperger syndrome a mild form of the disorder found that when the subjects inhaled the hormone oxytocin they scored significantly better on a test that involved recognizing faces and performed much better in a game that involved tossing a ball with others although more research is needed to confirm and explore the findings the results are the latest in a growing body of evidence indicating that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain disorder function better this is the first study that looked at whether oxytocin has an effect on social behavior which is a major deficit in autism said angela sirigu who directs the national center for scientific research in france and led the study published online by the proceedings of the national academy of sciences it looks like it could be very helpful researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism i think it s going to be a very exciting finding for a lot of people said alex martin chief of cognitive neuropsychology at the national institute of mental health because oxytocin does not last long in the body and produces its effects for a relatively brief period some experts said the findings were more likely to encourage drug companies to develop alternative substances that had the same benefits this paper suggests that s worth doing said thomas r insel director of the institute it adds another brick in the wall that suggests there may be an opportunity to develop treatment for one of the core symptoms of autism that s been the brass ring but sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself especially for children administering the hormone soon after a child s autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally she said it s possible it can become a cure if it s given early when the problems are detected in the little kids sirigu said we can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood because previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well said karen parker an assistant professor of psychiatry at stanford university school of medicine if you can find someone who appears to have deficits in oxytocin biology giving them what you might argue would be replacement oxytocin may be helpful parker said autism is a baffling disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms including speech and learning problems and profound disabling difficulties understanding emotions and social cues when interacting with people the number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious oxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals it plays a key role in social interaction promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals the hormone also heightens social sensitivity social awareness generosity and trust in people previous u s studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices another study being published in the journal biological psychiatry found that autistic males in australia ages to who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people s facial expressions all the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism said eric hollander director of the compulsive impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the montefiore medical center in new york while cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings oxytocin has been in use for several years as an alternative therapy for autism many families are using it with success and reporting improvement said wendy fournier president of the national autism association getting double blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports we need to be mindful of the fact that the majority of human studies of oxytocin have been conducted using adults including this study and only one paper has included individuals between the ages of and we have to be careful about the safety and efficacy of oxytocin on pediatric populations said clara lajonchere vice president of clinical programs for autism speaks,1
en español by randy dotinga healthday reporter thursday feb healthday news just in time for valentine s day comes word that eating dark chocolate appears to lower your risk of stroke or lessen the likelihood of death after a stroke but the findings based on a review of existing research aren t conclusive and they don t prove that chocolate is good for your heart and dietitians say too much chocolate can be harmful still two of the three studies analyzed in the review provide yet another suggestion that health benefits lurk in chocolate dark chocolate in particular said review co author dr gustavo saposnik if choosing among white chocolate milk chocolate or dark chocolate i d definitely go with the dark chocolate said saposnik director of the stroke research unit at st michael s hospital in toronto the review authors who found three studies on chocolate consumption and stroke between and are scheduled to report their findings at the american academy of neurology s annual meeting in toronto in april one study found no significant association between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke or death from stroke but another found that the stroke rate was percent lower in people who ate chocolate once a week and a third reported that death from stroke was percent lower in those who ate grams of chocolate once a week the health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate saposnik said antioxidants are thought to prevent cell damage in years past the message was that chocolate consumption might be associated with higher ldl bad cholesterol or perhaps higher incidence of cardiovascular disease he said today we know that all chocolates are not the same so should you and your sweetheart add dark chocolate to your diet i m not sure we can provide any recommendation at this time saposnik said for one thing it s possible that some factor other than chocolate could be helping lower the risk of stroke those who eat more chocolate could be wealthier and have better access to health care for instance or go to the gym more often saposnik said more studies will help clarify the association between chocolate and stroke risk for now said registered dietitian katie clark caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food even though it s fine in moderation chocolate is a major source of saturated fat which raises bad cholesterol and boosts heart disease risk said clark an assistant clinical professor at the university of california at san francisco but keith thomas ayoob an associate professor at albert einstein college of medicine in new york city who studies nutrition said chocolate does have its benefits several studies indicate that even a little chocolate can help reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow through the arteries both are good for heart health he said it s nice to know that chocolate isn t bad for you assuming you eat modest amounts and don t become overweight by overeating it more information the national stroke association has more on stroke,1

cnn eating a diet rich in healthy fats and limiting dairy and meat could do more than keep your heart healthier it could also help keep you thinking clearly new research shows that sticking to the mediterranean diet previously shown to reduce heart and other health issues also may help lower the risk of having small areas of dead tissue linked to thinking problems known as brain infarcts they re involved in vascular dementia the second most common form of dementia after alzheimer s disease we ve got these diseases of aging that cause disability cost a ton of money to treat and manage and wreck people s lives said dr gregory cole a professor of medicine and neurology at the university of california los angeles who was not involved in this new study you ve got to get in there and figure out what actually works for prevention and not have people guessing a mediterranean diet includes a lot of fruit vegetables and fish olive oil legumes and cereals and fewer dishes containing dairy meat poultry and saturated fatty acids than other diets it also involves small to moderate amounts of alcohol the study relates diet to strokes said dr nikolaos scarmeas a neurologist at columbia university medical center and lead author of the study the research will be presented at the annual meeting of the american academy of neurology in april an infarct a kind of stroke happens when the passage of blood is slowed or completely blocked by clotting this study looked at people who had never had a clinical stroke but may have had smaller strokes that went unnoticed an mri brain scan can detect these small strokes the study looked at people over the age of living in new york participants were asked about their diet and then about six years later underwent an mri in general dietary patterns are consistent for at least seven or eight years scarmeas said researchers found that people who most closely followed a mediterranean like diet were percent less likely to have areas of brain damage compared with those whose eating habits were furthest from the diet the study shows association not causation meaning there could be some other factors linking the mediterranean diet to resilience against this form of brain damage for example other research has found that higher adherence to the diet seems to protect against hypertension also associated with these brain problems but in this new research when the scientists controlled for hypertension the diet was still linked to a lower risk of brain damage it is possible that the diet protects the brain vessels themselves irrespective of other problems such as high blood pressure scarmeas said the participants who followed the mediterranean diet the least had an increased risk for having strokes that was similar to people with hypertension those who most strongly adhered to the dietary regimen had a level of protection similar to people who did not have hypertension scarmeas previous research has shown that the mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of alzheimer s disease looking at individuals from the washington heights inwood columbia aging project researchers found a percent lower risk among those who stuck to this diet scientists reported in the annals of neurology in the people involved in the brain infarcts study are a subset of that original group as many as million to million americans have alzheimer s disease according to the national institute on aging between and percent of people over the age of have vascular dementia according to the mayo clinic other studies have suggested that this food regimen may help in preventing second heart attacks lowering cancer risk and stopping the need for diabetes drugs in patients with type diabetes the new study gives you better evidence than ever that this is actually protective and protective against the development of dementia cole said the risk factors for vascular disease overlap with those of alzheimer s disease he said these include high blood pressure high fat diets type diabetes and low folate intake people who have both alzheimer s and vascular disease a condition called mixed dementia have a more rapid progression of alzheimer s disease cole said a subsequent issue to address is whether a person must follow the entire mediterranean diet in order to reap these benefits or whether there are portions of it that contribute positive effects cole said it would be easier for people to focus on adding particular elements to their diets for example by taking fish oil capsules rather than trying to readjust their eating habits altogether cole s own research deals with fish oil which is relevant because fish is a component in the mediterranean diet the bottom line for dementia is that fish oil may help in the very early stages but more research must be done to confirm this he said in a study his group found that dha fatty acids from fish oil could delay or deter the onset of alzheimer s disease in rats or older mice that had been genetically altered to develop the condition also a recent study found that the dha component of fish oil from algae helped people with minor memory impairment but this needs to be replicated in order to be more definitive he said when scarmeas group looked at the individual components of the diet they found a stronger association between the overall diet and brain damage prevention than with any individual food in the diet suggesting that the combination all of the elements may be producing the effect scarmeas said researchers will continue to follow the participants in the study and check in on them every year and a half scarmeas said the next step would be to have controlled experiments concerning food and dementia in which participants are randomly assigned to follow a diet cole said it is complicated in general to compare the benefits of a particular diet with the benefits of not following a different food regimen,1
london reuters scientists have used an artificial pancreas system of pumps and monitors to improve blood sugar control in diabetes patients in the first study to show the new device works better than conventional treatment researchers from britain s cambridge university tested the device on children with type diabetes during a series of nights in hospital and found it kept their blood sugar levels within the important normal range for percent of the time the new system which involves patients wearing a matchbox sized monitor and a similar sized pump with a tube to deliver insulin into the body also halved the amount of time blood sugar dropped to worrying or dangerous levels they said medical device makers have been working for years to develop a so called artificial pancreas to deliver insulin to patients with type diabetes an autoimmune disease in which the body destroys its own ability to make insulin the bodies of type diabetes sufferers become unable to properly break down sugar and if untreated blood vessels and nerves are destroyed organs fail and patients die these devices could transform the management of type diabetes but it is likely to be a gradual process roman hovorka of cambridge who led the research said in a telephone interview he said the results were an important stepping stone toward bringing an artificial pancreas to the commercial market but predicted several years yet of refinement before it could be used day and night by patients in normal life it s a bit like with mobile phones when we started the technology wasn t very good and the functionality was limited and it took a number of generations to move to the device that we have now i see the same thing with this system the juvenile diabetes research foundation said last month it was teaming up with u s drugmaker johnson johnson s unit animas which makes insulin pumps and dexcom inc which makes continuous glucose monitoring devices to develop and test an artificial pancreas system the cambridge study published in the lancet medical journal on friday used devices and sensors from smiths medical a unit of smiths group abbott diabetes care a unit of abbott laboratories and medtronic the ultimate goal is to create a device that can check patients blood day and night during and between meals and deliver insulin as required the cambridge study found their device performed better than a conventional pump which delivers insulin at pre set rates and which kept blood sugar levels around normal for percent of the time compared with percent for the artificial pancreas hovorka said the findings were particularly encouraging because the study included nights when the children went to bed after eating a large evening meal or having done exercise both of which can affect blood sugar levels,0
feb it has been called the holy grail of treatment for insulin dependent diabetes and it may be close to reality for decades researchers have searched unsuccessfully for ways to automatically coordinate insulin delivery with real time changes in blood sugar to essentially create an artificial pancreas that maintains target blood sugar levels with minimal effort now new technology is making this possible and new research shows that an experimental system can improve nighttime blood sugar control using sophisticated computer software researchers were able to coordinate the actions of a commercially available continuous glucose monitoring device and insulin pump to allow automatic insulin delivery in response to real time glucose readings the system proved better than a conventional insulin pump for maintaining optimal blood sugar levels during the night in a study from the u k s university of cambridge aaron j kowalski phd of the juvenile diabetes research foundation which was involved in funding the research says the study represents an important step forward in the search for a clinically feasible artificial pancreas to improve outcomes and quality of life among insulin dependent diabetes patients this is hugely promising and very significant research he tells webmd nighttime is the time of day that strikes fear into patients and parents of children with diabetes,1

the bodies of many older americans are practically bionic more than hip and knee replacements are performed each year in the united states now another aging joint is fast becoming a candidate for replacement this year patients are expected to undergo surgery to replace arthritic or injured ankles with artificial joints made of metal alloys and lightweight plastic according to industry estimates four models are commonly used in the united states with food and drug administration approval and demand is expected to grow as more and more baby boomers hobble into their s and s with debilitating ankle pain ankle replacement has been around for three decades but it has been slow to catch on problems with early devices left surgeons and patients wary the operation is complex and many foot and ankle surgeons lack experience while medicare pays for ankle replacement many private insurers do not each year about two million americans visit the doctor for ankle pain from arthritis or fracture an estimated people a year experience end stage ankle arthritis in which the ankle cartilage has worn away completely causing painful bone on bone contact and some level of disability until lately such patients have had only one surgical option ankle fusion surgery in which the worn out part of the joint is removed and the bones are permanently locked together with screws and plates the procedure usually relieves pain but the patient loses mobility in the ankle leading to changes in gait and ultimately additional wear and tear and arthritic pain in other parts of the ankle about ankle fusions were performed in the united states last year andrew keaveney now shattered his ankle in a fall from a truck while hanging flags as an american legion volunteer surgery repaired the broken bones but he continued to have severe pain doctors suggested ankle fusion but he found a surgeon who offered total ankle replacement he had the operation in december and now he says the ankle is percent before the surgery i couldn t sleep at night said mr keaveney of locust valley n y now i m able to climb ladders i have absolutely no pain i was even playing soccer with my grandkids a few months ago his surgeon dr craig s radnay an associate at the insall scott kelly institute for orthopedics and sports medicine in new york city and on long island says he is now a big believer in ankle replacement for certain patients for an ankle replacement you have to be a little more picky in who you select for those cases he said but i can t tell you how many patients come in and i mention this option they don t even know exists dr radnay who says he has performed more than ankle replacements using an inbone device from wright medical group of arlington tenn is now a paid consultant to the company helping to gather data on long term success rates the ideal patient is around years old and of normal weight although doctors consider older patients depending on their health people with diabetes may not be good candidates because they may risk complications as a result of poor blood circulation dr jonathan t deland chief of the foot and ankle service at the hospital for special surgery in manhattan said that while the devices had improved he remained cautious about offering the operation dr deland is helping to develop a new ankle replacement device for zimmer of warsaw ind which may be submitted for f d a approval this year the big concern about ankle replacement is how often do they fail and how often do they loosen he said complications can include slow healing as well as infection severe complications are rare but they can result in amputation still dr deland said we re getting fewer and fewer failures the new models require that less bone be removed so the bone to which the device is affixed is stronger in addition instruments used to guide surgeons in aligning the artificial joint have improved dr deland cited data showing that for some recent models percent of ankle replacements were still in place after an average of eight and a half years though the four devices in common use have technical differences in design and in how they are implanted doctors say the choice of device matters far less than the experience of the surgeon the procedure is among the most difficult that foot and ankle surgeons perform and one of the biggest challenges is getting proper alignment of the replacement joint dr brian donley an orthopedic surgeon who is director of the foot and ankle center at the cleveland clinic says patients should always ask their doctor to disclose any financial interest in a device he performed the first united states operation using the salto talaris device from tornier of minneapolis and receives consulting fees from the company even with a successful implantation patients should not necessarily expect to have the same ankles they did at they should not try to return to activities like basketball and distance running but golf and walking and sometimes even skiing are typically allowed my happiest patients i have in my practice are my ankle replacement patients dr donley said they are so appreciative about how their life has been changed they can go to their grandchild s wedding and get up and have a dance,1

boston reuters if you re checking into the hospital for surgery doctors may soon be swabbing your nose in an effort to prevent an infection from appearing after your operation researchers in the netherlands said on wednesday they were able to cut the risk of a common bacterium by nearly percent by first looking for signs of it in the nose and then treating it with an antibiotic nasal gel and full body wash the treatment combination also shaved two days off a typical day stay in the hospital hospital acquired infections are a major problem in medicine so doctors are always looking for the best way to reduce the risk about million surgeries are done just in the united states each year and in as many as half a million cases infections occur at the site of surgery up to percent of those infections are caused by strains of the bacterium staphylococcus aureus which otherwise benignly resides in the nose and on the skin the new study published in the new england journal of medicine used a rapid test to identify which patients most of whom were scheduled to undergo surgery had the bacteria in at least one nostril the patients treated with the antibiotic nose gel mupirocin also known as bactroban and washed with chlorhexidine a common ingredient in mouthwash developed an s aureus infection percent of the time the rate for volunteers given placebo treatment was percent the research team led by dr lonneke bode of erasmus university medical center in rotterdam estimated that patients would need to be screened to prevent one infection preventing one infection will pay for thousands of these screenings dr henri verbrugh of erasmus a coauthor of the study said in a telephone interview infections are also a problem when doctors put tubes into the body although his team did not evaluate enough patients to study the problem directly we feel this technology is capable of preventing those types of infections as well verbrugh said a second infection study also reported in the journal found that a chlorhexidine alcohol combination produced percent fewer surgical site infections as the commonly used mixture of povidone and iodine which gives a yellow orange tinge to the skin in a commentary dr richard wenzel of the virginia commonwealth university in richmond said the chlorhexidine alcohol mixture should replace the older disinfectant when scrubbing people for surgery and the nasal disinfection technique should primarily be used for people undergoing cardiac surgery receiving an implant or whose immune system is likely to be affected,1

by amanda gardner healthday reporter friday jan healthday news three quarters of patients undergoing surgery for stubborn sinusitis saw significant improvements in their quality of life new research shows most of the remaining percent also saw some improvement just not as dramatic said dr timothy smith lead author of a study appearing in the january issue of otolaryngology head and neck surgery certainly this reinforces our belief that sinus surgery increases the quality of life of patients and i see that clinically as well as scientifically added dr jordan s josephson a sinus and allergy specialist at lenox hill hospital in new york city previous studies have been single center studies and this is a bigger study using multiple centers and using a fairly large population so it further says sinus surgery is a really good thing to do if you need it chronic rhinosinusitis crs affects a sizable minority percent to percent of u s residents the condition marked by symptoms such as sinus pain and pressure headache stuffy nose and sneezing can compromise quality of life more than even congestive heart failure back pain or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease the study authors said endoscopic sinus surgery has been performed in the united states since the mid s said smith who is director of the oregon sinus center at oregon health science university in portland it s a minimally invasive type of surgery performed with a telescope that goes into the nostril then basically snips away abnormal and interfering tissue while leaving normal tissue behind smith explained smith and his co authors studied patients with crs from three academic medical centers following them for an average of a year and a half after their surgery these were patients who have chronic sinusitis so by definition they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a ct scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses smith said following the surgery about percent of patients had clinically significant improvement in quality of life as measured by various validated scales patients with worse disease at the outset seemed to fare the best after the procedure as did those undergoing surgery for the first time this second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with josephson said none of which is to say that patients shouldn t try medical therapies first he added i don t think it means everyone with crs should consider surgery they should try medical therapy and if medical therapy fails and the surgeon feels that part of the problem is anatomic then surgery would be a good tool for them to use josephson said some people with stage and diseases may even get cured this is a wonderful renewed hope of feeling better more information the u s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases has more on sinusitis,1
en español by steven reinberg healthday reporter tuesday dec healthday news many older adults consume ginkgo biloba hoping to keep their minds sharp but a new study finds that the herbal product doesn t stave off cognitive decline measuring the effect of ginkgo in a big trial in older people we didn t see any effect of the drug on slowing down or delaying normal age related changes of cognition said lead researcher dr steven t dekosky vice president and dean of the university of virginia school of medicine in charlottesville if you are older and thinking i ll try ginkgo to preserve brain health we have no evidence that it is useful he said i won t take it anymore the report published in the dec issue of the journal of the american medical association supports the findings of earlier smaller studies to test ginkgo s effect on cognitive decline dekosky s group looked at results from the ginkgo evaluation of memory study which included community dwelling adults to years of age the participants who were generally healthy when the study began either took milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities over more than six years of follow up the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory language attention visuospatial abilities or executive functions such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly these results remained the same regardless of sex age race or education the researchers noted however ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted dekosky added the good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe the bad news was it didn t seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging earlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of alzheimer s or other dementias dekosky said the american botanical council took issue with the findings however there are many significant limitations of this study mark blumenthal council founder and executive director said in a statement first the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition second about percent of the subjects dropped out over the six year duration of the trial the statistics reported in the study include the dropouts for which no final data are available blumenthal said further the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not also the age of the subjects is quite advanced at an average of years at the beginning of the trial this age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance another group the council for responsible nutrition crn which represents the dietary supplement industry also had reservations about the study in a statement douglas mackay crn s vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs said that there is a large body of previously published evidence as well as ongoing trials which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults he added that as a former practicing naturopathic doctor i have had the benefit of working with patients and have seen firsthand how ginkgo biloba can be effective in improving cognitive function ginkgo biloba is believed to have antioxidant and anti inflammatory properties that protect cell membranes and help govern the workings of the brain s chemical messengers or neurotransmitters dr lon s schneider director of the state of california s alzheimer s disease research and clinical center at the university of southern california los angeles said that these findings were straightforward and expected no measurable effect from ginkgo is seen on cognition schneider said regardless of whether people say i take it and i feel better you just don t see an effect he said still schneider won t object if someone wants to try it it is not in my position to deflate hope he said if someone really feels they need to take this and they need to try it well go ahead and do it but their expectations should be realistic and if they don t experience anything then they probably should stop more information for more information on ginkgo biloba go to the u s national center for complementary and alternative medicine,1
dec scientists at the dana farber cancer institute say they have developed a compound that may be capable of halting a common type of drug resistant lung cancer their study is published in the dec issue of the journal nature the researchers say the framework of the new compound is different from that of other cancer drugs and acts against a protein that carries a structural defect according to a news release that protein is known as an epidermal growth factor receptor egfr kinase the scientists say non small cell lung cancers that had become invulnerable to the chemotherapy drugs iressa and tarceva were stymied in a study by a compound designed and formulated in the dana farber laboratory the researchers say their new compound shows how fast lung cancer research and development are moving forward the dana farber scientists say current egfr inhibitors iressa and tarceva prevent egfr from sending signals that are essential to keep tumor cells growing the researchers say however over time the tumor cells develop additional mutations enabling them to grow again even in the presence of the drugs iressa or tarceva the scientists say in the news release that not only did they find that a compound called wz can slow tumor growth but that it is possible to selectively target the drug resistant mutant egfr in tumors with relatively less effect on the normal egfr in health tissues much work lies ahead in determining whether the compound and related ones will prove to be effective therapies but the researchers say their discovery demonstrates the power of screening specially designed compounds against cancers with certain genetic quirks it s early to discuss the use of such compounds in patients the scientists say but one of the researchers michael j eck md phd also of dana farber says he s optimistic their approach will lead to an effective treatment for the thousands of non small cell lung cancer patients worldwide who develop resistance to iressa and tarceva every year the new compound seems promising in mouse models the researchers say adding they hope it proves effective in clinical trials and is better tolerated than drugs now used lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the u s for men and women non small cell lung cancer constitutes about of lung cancer cases,1
health experts call for heart checkups for kids enlarge this image toggle caption michael perez ap michael perez ap in growing numbers health experts are recommending screening for heart disease in children especially those who play sports one in people ages to are estimated to die suddenly and unexpectedly as a result of congenital undiagnosed heart malfunctions and children who play sports are nearly three times more likely to suffer sudden cardiac death than their nonathletic counterparts few of the kids actually experience sudden death while they re in class or at home says thomas debauche a houston cardiologist it s pretty much while they re in training or while they re on the field performing because that s when the adrenalin is flowing and that s when they re calling on the heart for peak performance these surprise attacks are due to inherited problems that children are born with cardiologist douglas zipes past president of the american academy of cardiology says the problems kids suffer are typically electrical like abnormal heart rhythms or structural like a thickening of the heart muscle both of these problems are exacerbated during exertion when kids play sports according to zipes the adrenalin that is released when you re participating in sports can stimulate this abnormally thick heart muscle and cause a fatal heart rhythm problem that is a very rapid heartbeat with no effective contraction no blood being ejected to the brain and other organs the result is sudden cardiac death typically schools require kids to provide a family history and have a simple physical exam before participating in sports but zipes says more should be done cardiologist debauche agrees he recently screened more than high school athletes in the houston area using electrocardiogram or ekg to measure the electrical activity of the heart about percent of the students had an abnormal ekg one of them was louis anthony who suffered from asthma in severe cases asthma can cause the heart to thicken and put kids at risk of cardiomyopathy and sudden death anthony s asthma diminished over time and he says he can still play soccer run fast and breathe just fine after the abnormal ekg result however debauche told anthony and his parents to closely monitor the asthma they have for other students who had abnormal ekg results some received medication for blood pressure and others were treated for abnormal heart rhythms about percent were told it was too dangerous for them to continue in sports three students had serious heart problems including one who suffered from a rare disease in which the heart muscle is spongy and contracts poorly he was literally running the stadium stairs at the time we found him debauche says he was preparing for track season by running up and down the stadium stairs debauche says the heart screening turned out to be life saving for this student athlete the student now has an implantable defibrillator and is awaiting a heart transplant the severity of this and the other two problems that turned up as a result of the abnormal ekgs are reason enough debauche says to screen all school athletes nationwide some health experts argue that would be too costly there s no official policy from the american college of cardiology but officials say most members support screening student athletes the american heart association suggests that athletes who are identified as at risk for heart problems as a result of a family history or physical exam be referred for further cardiovascular examination which could include an electrocardiogram,1
make that a bottomless cup coffee and tea drinkers are less likely to develop type diabetes than nondrinkers with those drinking three to four cups a day at a percent lower risk for the disease than those who drink less than two cups a large analysis has found it does not matter whether the drinks are caffeinated or not said the study published in the archives of internal medicine the analysis does not prove that drinking tea or coffee lowers the risk of the so called adult onset diabetes but it is not the first study to report such a link and it goes further than other studies finding that for caffeinated coffee risk dropped by percent to percent with each additional cup consumed which the researchers say suggests a causal relationship those drinking more than six cups of coffee a day were at percent lower risk for diabetes than nondrinkers the figure for those who drank less than a cup per day was just percent some studies have indicated that chemical components of tea and coffee may have beneficial effects on glucose metabolism and insulin sensitivity but the evidence is mixed caffeine can t be the answer because you see the same sort of overall response from diabetes with decaf as with caffeinated coffee said the paper s senior author mark woodward a professor at mount sinai medical center in new york,0
dec a fatty substance found naturally in the lungs may provide a natural defense against respiratory syncytial virus rsv infection new research suggests the substance a lipid known as popg may prevent rsv infection as well as limit the spread of the virus once infection has occurred our findings demonstrate that popg is a potent antiviral agent both as a prophylactic and after infection has occurred researcher dennis voelker phd professor of medicine at national jewish health in denver says in a news release while these are still early studies several characteristics of popg make me believe that it has real potential as both an antiviral and anti inflammatory treatment rsv is the major cause of hospitalization in young children under age and is an increasingly problematic infection in adults with chronic lung disease the elderly and those with weakened immune systems there is no vaccine or easy effective treatment for rsv popgis one of several lipids found in the fluid that lines the air sacs of the lungs researchers say that until now the function of popg has been unclear in the study published in the proceedings of the national academy of sciences researchers examined the effects of popg on rsv infection in human lung cells in the lab and in mice infected with the virus they found that inoculating human lung cells with popg before exposure to rsv prevented infection with the virus as well as the cell death and inflammation normally associated with rsv infection applying popg to the cells after rsv infection also inhibited the spread of the virus to neighboring healthy cells in addition the study showed treating infected mice with popg dramatically reduced infection and prevented the spread of the inflammatory cells into the lungs researchers say popg appears to work by binding to rsv and preventing it from binding to other cells the findings also suggest that popg s role in the lungs may be to help the lungs tolerate the daily barrage of inhaled irritants popg is already used in other treatments and has been safely given to millions of premature infants to protect their lungs it is also inexpensive and easy to use therefore together with the results of this study researchers say the compound merits further research as a treatment for rsv infection in humans,1

chicago reuters radiation from ct scans done in will cause cancers and kill nearly americans researchers said on monday medical personnel examine a scan sent from a hospital using a ct scanner in the southern indian city of bangalore september reuters kavita chandran budhraja the findings published in the archives of internal medicine add to mounting evidence that americans are overexposed to radiation from diagnostic tests especially from a specialized kind of x ray called a computed tomography or ct scan what we learned is there is a significant amount of radiation with these ct scans more than what we thought and there is a significant number of cancers said dr rita redberg editor of the archives of internal medicine where the studies were published it s estimated that just from the ct scans done in one year just in there will be excess deaths redberg said in a telephone interview we re doing millions of ct scans every year and the numbers are increasing that is a lot of excess deaths ct scans give doctors a view inside the body often eliminating the need for exploratory surgery but ct scans involve much higher radiation dose than conventional x rays a chest ct scan exposes the patient to more than times the radiation dose of a chest x ray about million ct scans were done on americans in up from million in amy berrington de gonzalez of the national cancer institute and colleagues developed a computer model to estimate the impact of so many scans they estimated the scans done in will cause cancers a third of the projected cancers will occur in people who were ages to when they got their ct two thirds will occur in women and percent will arise from scans done in children or teens the researchers estimated there will be an extra excess breast cancers just from ct scans done in unneeded tests redberg who wrote a commentary on the studies said u s doctors enthusiasm for the tests has led to an explosion in their use that is putting patients at risk while certainly some of the scans are incredibly important and life saving it is also certain that some of them were not necessary redberg said in a separate study dr rebecca smith bindman of the university of california san francisco and colleagues analyzed data from patients undergoing the most common types of diagnostic ct scans at four institutions in they found radiation dosage varied widely between different types of ct studies from a median or midpoint of millisieverts for a routine head ct scan to millisieverts for a scan of the abdomen and pelvis which often involves taking multiple images of the same organ by comparison the average american is exposed to about millisieverts of radiation a year from ground radon or flying in an airplane a level not considered a risk to health the researchers said efforts need to be taken to minimize ct radiation exposure including reducing the number of unnecessary tests cutting the dose per study and standardizing the doses across facilities imaging equipment makers such as ge healthcare siemens philips and toshiba medical systems are working to develop low dose ct scanners,1
dec a less invasive needle biopsy may be nearly as effective as surgical biopsy at diagnosing breast cancer and with far fewer side effects a new review of more than studies on the two breast cancer screening methods shows breast needle biopsy was able to distinguish between cancerous and noncancerous breast lesions with about the same accuracy as surgical biopsy and less than half the risk of complications women suspected of having breast cancer after initial screening are usually referred for a biopsy to determine whether the lesion is cancerous in most cases the lump or lesion is benign or noncancerous and does not require further treatment biopsies may be performed via open surgery on the breast or with a less invasive core needle biopsy in which a small sample of breast tissue from the affected area is removed through a special needle inserted through the skin researchers say needle biopsy has fewer complications and a shorter recovery time than open surgical biopsy but some women and doctors may have concerns about the accuracy of the procedure compared with traditional open surgery methods of breast cancer diagnosis in the study published in the annals of internal medicine researchers reviewed studies on the two methods the results showed that core needle biopsies were about as accurate as open surgery at detecting cancerous vs noncancerous breast lesions needle biopsies also had a much lower rate of complications less than compared with with open surgery in addition the study showed women initially diagnosed with breast cancer with needle biopsy were more likely to be treated with a single breast cancer surgery than those initially diagnosed by open surgical biopsy based on currently available evidence it appears reasonable to substitute core needle biopsy procedures for open surgical biopsy given the comparable sensitivity and lower complication rates write researcher wendy bruening phd of the ecri institute evidence based practices center in plymouth meeting pa and colleagues they say additional studies are needed to find out what factors affect the accuracy of core needle breast biopsy,1
cnn as a thick gray haze began to descend over the words in her schoolbooks and eventually the faces of loved ones barbara campbell barely grasped that she was going blind i didn t realize that i wasn t seeing the same as everybody else because how would i know that said campbell who began losing her sight in middle school by the time campbell reached adulthood her vision was gone it s like looking through a frosted window campbell said of how she sees the world it s like that all the time doctors diagnosed retinitis pigmentosa a progressive eye disease that damages the cells of the retina the part of the eye that detects light for years campbell survived even thrived as a blind woman navigating new york city then earlier this year she went from coping with blindness to hoping she might see again campbell is one of only people in the united states participating in an fda approved study of an artificial retina a microchip implanted in the eye to stimulate damaged cells amazing said campbell with a smile it s like star trek a microchip to help someone see may sound more like a star trek device than legitimate science but it is real this is really the first step toward a really bionic eye said aries arditi a senior fellow in vision science at lighthouse international a nonprofit advocacy group for the blind and one of the study sites for the artificial retina a healthy retina sends electrical signals to the brain telling it how to decipher light a damaged retina cannot transmit those signals so the artificial retina is outfitted with rows of tiny electrodes to do the job in july campbell underwent surgery to implant the microchip into her eye when light goes into campbell s eyes she doesn t see anything because it s not being projected by the cells of the retina said dr lucian del priore an ophthalmologist at new york presbyterian columbia university medical center who implanted campbell s artificial retina this is an artificial device that essentially stimulates the retina electrically del priore said how to see a tree artificially since her eyes cannot detect light or images on their own campbell wears a pair of sunglasses outfitted with a small camera as she scans and focuses the camera on an object in her environment for example a tree a wireless device transmits that image to the artificial retina inside her eye the electrodes on the microchip then stimulate cells on the retina roughly in the shape of the tree the shape is communicated to the brain the idea being that campbell might one day perceive some semblance of a shape of that tree it s a rudimentary level of vision said brian mech vice president of business development at second sight medical products inc the developer and manufacturer of the artificial retina but for people without vision that can be pretty remarkable in the first generation artificial retina had only electrodes patients were able to do things that we would not have anticipated with so few electrodes mech said one patient could shoot baskets and another was crossing crosswalks campbell received one of the second generation artificial retinas with electrodes and thus far according to her doctors has made significant progress when she stands outside her apartment building she can now sense light emanating from windows navigating up the stairs of her building she now knows that there is light illuminating the hallways and when she arrives home and makes tea she can sense light coming from the burners on the stove and just recently during a vision test campbell was able to correctly identify a sequence of letters for the first time in decades i was like you re kidding campbell said i was shocked i still can t believe it campbell s doctors try to temper her excitement and that of other study participants being able to repair in some way a function that has been lost is a very exciting thing del priore said but it is important to be realistic recognizing faces driving or reading the small print in newspapers is a very long way off mech said and while some patients like campbell do well with the implant there are some who struggle still the feeling among those involved in the study is tempered excitement we can now take someone who is totally blind and turn them into someone with very very poor vision said arditi who trains campbell weekly on how to nurture her vision that s really the first time in history we ve been able to do that devices with and electrodes are in production and the hope mech said is that more electrodes will mean more detailed vision today the artificial retina is primarily for sufferers of retinitis pigmentosa but it could expand to other diseases like dry age related macular degeneration mech said there are people in the united states affected by retinitis pigmentosa according to the national eye institute a division of the national institutes of health training campbell s eye and brain to see again will take years of rehabilitation her vision is in black and white and will never be perfect those factors do not prevent campbell from dreaming what i d actually really hoped and i m not sure if it s going to happen is seeing colors campbell said if i could see colors again my plan was to go to the grand canyon,1
