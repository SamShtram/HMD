"Wilmington, DE, December 17, 2018 - The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing system may be able to restore the effectiveness of first-line chemotherapies used to treat lung cancer by deleting or ""knocking out"" a gene in cancer tumors that helps the tumors develop resistance to the drugs. That was the conclusion of a new study published today in the journal Molecular Therapy Oncolytics by scientists from The Gene Editing Institute of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care Health System. The study reports that in both tissue culture and in a mouse, tumor growth stopped and there was a dramatic decrease in the volume of existing tumors when chemotherapy was combined with CRIPSP-Cas9, which was used to disable a tumor gene known as NRF2. Previous studies have shown that the NRF2 gene controls cell functions in lung cancer tumors that helps them thwart the effect of chemotherapies that might otherwise reduce or eliminate them entirely. ""Our goal is to see if CRISPR can be used with chemotherapy to provide a safe, affordable way to give patients who are not responding to treatment at least a fighting chance against this very challenging cancer,"" said Eric Kmiec, Ph.D., the principal author of the study and the director of the Gene Editing Institute. ""We believe that finding ways to use CRISPR to improve existing treatments will lead to some of the first benefits for patients while we tackle the vital ethical issues around the use of CRISPR for edits that can be passed on through DNA. This is an exciting step in the journey of exploring the health benefits of gene editing."" The study was led by Pawel Bialk, research scientist at the Gene Editing Institute, the nation's only CRISPR-focused research initiative situated in a community health care system. Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer death in the United States. Dr. Kmiec said there are chemotherapies that have helped patients achieve remission or at least live longer and enjoy a better quality of life by significantly slowing the progress of the disease. But he said some patients with non-small-cell lung cancer, the most common form of lung cancer, are resistant to chemotherapy agents used to treat the disease or develop resistance after being exposed to the drugs. Developing CRISPR in a Community Health Center: A Patient-Focused Approach Dr. Kmiec said the lung cancer work reflects an approach adopted by the Gene Editing Institute to move cautiously in developing medical applications of gene editing. Based inside the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute at Christiana Care, his research team gains unique insight into the lives and needs of cancer patients and the health care professionals who care for them, which helps them to maintain a strong focus on doing what's right for patients. Dr. Kmiec noted that while his team is working to move into human trials, the CRISPR application being developed for lung cancer does not involve directly editing a patient's genome --only the genes in the tumor. CRISPR stands for ""clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats."" It was originally a defense mechanism found in bacteria that allows the bacteria to recognize and slice up the DNA of invading viruses. Scientists have learned how to manipulate this mechanism so that it essentially can be programmed to find and remove a specific sequence of DNA code--which acts like software for controlling biological activity in a cell. Cas9 is a reference to an enzyme, sometimes described as a form of ""molecular scissors,"" that is used by CRISPR to cut out a section of DNA code. Research Aimed at Real-World, Affordable Solutions Dr. Kmiec said there are many efforts under way to modify CRISPR so that it can be used to not only remove or ""knock out"" a section DNA, but also to replace or ""knock in"" a new strand of code. But he said there continues to be significant safety concerns around this type of CRISPR application. He said for now, his team is focused on ""using CRISPR in its native form, which is to just cut out a section of DNA,"" and to start with applications that do not directly impact the patient's DNA. He said using CRISPR to do things like improving drug response represents the ""low-hanging fruit"" of CRISPR patient applications. ""We think it's best to start with CRISPR therapies that involve relatively conservative uses of this powerful tool,"" Dr. Kmiec said. ""This approach can also hopefully help contain costs and provide a level of safety and reliability that is reassuring for patients and increases the chance that insurance companies will provide coverage."" Dr. Kmiec said that as a CRISPR research program that treats patients from across the economic spectrum, his scientists are keenly aware of the challenges of making cutting edge medical treatments accessible and beneficial for all patients. ""This work is another significant step on the pathway to FDA approval,"" said Nicholas J. Petrelli, M.D., FACS, Bank of America endowed medical director of the Helen F. Graham Cancer Center & Research Institute. ""The Gene Editing Institute is taking a careful and methodical approach to developing innovative therapies. Dr. Kmiec and his team interact with our oncologists who deal with lung cancer every day on how gene editing could have a realistic impact and improve treatment. This multidisciplinary clinical/scientific team has been working together to develop a compassionate bench-to-bedside approach. Their laboratory benches are literally down the hall from our patients and the oncologist's offices."" ### Downloadable photos Video about the Gene Editing Institute About the Gene Editing Institute The Gene Editing Institute is the only research institute of its kind in the nation based within a community health care system.

"Scientists from the University of Seville indicate that it can lessen the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease Researchers from the Department of Pharmacology at the University of Seville have recently published a study in which they state that diets supplemented with aqueous extract of Annona muricata L. leaves can prevent the symptoms associated with fibromyalgia, so improving the lives of these patients. Leaves of the species Annona muricata L. come from a tree of between 4 and 6 metres in height, from the botanical family Annonaceae. They are simple leaves, oblong and egg-like or oblong and elliptical in shape and between 5 and 15 cm in length. This species is native to the tropical areas of the Americas and is especially abundant in the Amazon region. It is usually cultivated for its medicinal use. The leaves have different ethnomedical uses according to their country of origin. The most important uses in traditional medicine, scientifically validated in pre-clinical tests, are for inflammation, pain, infections, diabetes and cancer. ""The consumption of extract of Annona muricata L. leaves in pharmaceutical form and in the correct dosage can reduce the chronic pain, anxiety and depression that accompany this disease. This extract comes from the traditional preparation using decoction"", informs the expert Ana María Quilez from the Medicinal Plants research group at the University of Seville. This study was carried out over one month using 60 five-week old female rats in the laboratories of the Faculty of Pharmacy. The animals were divided into six groups that were fed a standard diet supplement with different quantities of this plant. After the results obtained by the researchers, the next step will be to carry out clinical tests with patients, to corroborate the extract's activity and establish the safe and effective dose in humans. This study was made available online in June 2018 ahead of final publication in print in October 2018. ###",0,news_reviews_00008
"CHAPEL HILL - University of North Carolina Lineberger Comprehensive Cancer Center researchers have found that mailing self-collection kits to test for high-risk human papillomavirus infection has the potential to boost cervical cancer screening - especially for low-income women who are overdue for testing. In the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology, researchers published the results of mailing at-home, HPV self-collection kits to 193 low-income women in North Carolina who were overdue for screening according to national guidelines. They reported this screening approach detected high-risk HPV in all of the cases of women who were found to have high-grade, abnormal cervical precancerous growths, showing that self-collection at home for HPV may be a viable method to identify women at high-risk for cervical cancer. ""This is a demonstration that mailing self-collection kits and returning them to test for high-risk HPV infection has big potential to increase screening access among under-screened women, and to do that successfully,"" said UNC Lineberger's Jennifer S. Smith, the study's senior author, and a professor in the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. Although cervical cancer is preventable through early detection and treatment, the American Cancer Society estimates that more than 4,100 women will die from cervical cancer in the United States this year. Nearly 20 percent of women in the United States who are eligible for cervical cancer screening report they haven't been tested for cervical cancer within the recommended time interval, national surveys have shown. ""Women are dying unnecessarily of cervical cancer because they either haven't been vaccinated against HPV in adolescence, or they've not been getting screened according to national guidelines,"" Smith said. ""Increasing screening rates among under-screened women is of paramount importance."" In 2014, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration signed off on using an HPV test alone to screen for cervical cancer for women 25 years and older, in conjunction with the Pap test. Earlier this year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force gave an ""A"" rating to HPV primary screening alone for women aged 30 to 65. ""There are a lot of different barriers that cause women to be underscreened,"" said the study's first author Andrea Des Marais, MPH, project manager with the UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health. ""HPV tests are being widely used now in the United States, but only through physician collection in clinical practice, which requires that women come to a clinic. Offering HPV testing using self-collection by mail has a lot of potential to reach women who are the highest risk of being screened: those who don't access regular medical care."" For the study, researchers mailed at-home, self-collection kits to low-income women in North Carolina who were overdue for screening by national guidelines. They included women between the ages of 30 and 64 years who had reported no history of receiving a Pap test, which checks for precancerous or cancerous cells, within the past four years. Researchers provided study participants with self-collection brushes along with instructions for how to take a sample from inside the vagina. The brush samples were then tested in a lab for HPV and other sexually transmitted infections. Participants also self-collected samples at a clinic and handed them to a nurse, and had a pelvic exam for a clinician to collect a Pap smear sample. The researchers compared the results from self- and clinician-samples - which were tested for high-risk HPV strains that are linked to cervical cancer - to the Pap results and the results of cervical biopsies collected during colposcopy, which is a secondary diagnostic test that confirms the presence of cervical pre-cancerous lesions among women with abnormal Pap smear results. The home self-collection test indicated that 12.4 percent of women were infected with high-risk HPV, the self-collection tests used in the clinic found 15.5 of the women had high-risk HPV infection, and the clinician-collected test identified 11.4 percent of the women had high-risk HPV infection. ""We found comparable detection between self-collection and physician-collection,"" Des Marais said. All women found to have high-grade cervical lesions by Pap smear or by cervical biopsy were positive for high-risk HPV on their home self-collected sample. ""We found in this sample, all of the women who had high-grade lesions had HPV-positive home self-collection results,"" Smith said. ""We didn't miss any of those high-grade cases by conducting home self-collection."" Smith said there is more work to be done, such as identifying ways to make the self-collection process more efficient and cost-effective, and getting FDA approval for the clinical use of self-collection for cervical cancer screening. ""This is a proof-in-principle study that we used to determine whether home self-collection is highly effective for detecting high-grade disease,"" Smith said. ""We are already working on the next step, which is a clinical trial in which women who aren't up-to-date on screening get either a referral to a free clinic appointment to receive a screening, or receive a self-collection kit in the mail, followed by referral to a free clinic appointment. This will allow us to determine the effect that self-collection has on screening uptake."" ### In addition to Des Marais and Smith, other authors included Yuqian Zhao, Marcia M. Hobbs, Vijay Sivaraman, Lynn Barclay, and Noel T. Brewer. The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute, the National Institutes of Health, and the University Cancer Research Fund. Individual researchers were supported by the China Scholarship Council. Financial disclosure: High-risk HPV and sexually transmitted disease tests, sample preservation media, ThinPrep processor slides, and other equipment were donated by Hologic, Inc. Self-collection brushes were donated by Rovers Medical Devices. Some travel expenses for Des Marais were paid by Hologic, and others have consulted for the company. Smith has received research funding, supply donations, and consultancies, and served as a paid speaker for Arbor Vita, BD Diagnostics, Hologic, Rovers Medical Devices, and Trovagene.

"Men who eat plenty of fermented dairy products have a smaller risk of incident coronary heart disease than men who eat less of these products, according to a new study from the University of Eastern Finland. A very high consumption of non-fermented dairy products, on the other hand, was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. The findings were published in the British Journal of Nutrition. Earlier studies have shown that fermented dairy products have more positive effects on blood lipid profiles and on the risk of heart disease than other dairy products. Examples of fermented dairy products include cheese, yoghurt, quark, kefir and sour milk. However, research into the topic remains scarce. The Kuopio Ischaemic Heart Disease Risk Factor Study ongoing at the University of Eastern Finland explored the associations of fermented and non-fermented dairy products with the risk of incident coronary heart disease. Approximately 2,000 men participated in the study. Their dietary habits were assessed at the beginning of the study in 1984-1989, and they were followed up for an average of 20 years. During this follow-up, 472 men experienced an incident coronary heart disease event. The study participants were divided into groups on the basis of how much they ate different dairy products, and the researchers compared the groups with the highest and lowest consumption, while also taking various lifestyle and nutrition factors into consideration. When the study participants were divided into four groups on the basis of their consumption of fermented dairy products with less than 3.5% fat, the risk of incident coronary heart disease was 26% lower in the highest consumption group compared to the lowest consumption group. Sour milk was the most commonly used low-fat fermented dairy product. The consumption of high-fat fermented dairy products, such as cheese, was not associated with the risk of incident coronary heart disease. However, the researchers found that a very high consumption on non-fermented dairy products was associated with an increased risk of incident coronary heart disease. Milk was the most commonly used product in this category, and a very high consumption was defined as an average daily milk intake of 0.9 litres. Lower consumption levels were not associated with the risk. ""Here in Finland, people's habits of consuming different dairy products have changed over the past decades. For instance, the consumption of milk and sour milk have declined, while many fermented dairy products, such as yoghurt, quark and cheeses, have gained in popularity,"" Adjunct Professor Jyrki Virtanen from the University of Eastern Finland says. The new study provides further evidence on the health benefits that fermented dairy products may have over non-fermented ones. All the mechanisms are not understood yet, but they may be linked to compounds forming during the fermentation process. ### For further information, please contact: Jyrki Virtanen, PhD, Adjunct Professor in Nutrition Epidemiology (principal investigator).

"LOS ANGELES (Embargoed Until Oct. 18, 2018 @ 10:05AM ET) -- A surgical technique called EDAS (encephaloduroarteriosynangiosis) significantly decreases the rate of stroke recurrence and death for patients with severe atherosclerosis of the brain arteries, according to findings of a Phase IIa clinical trial presented today at the World Stroke Congress in Montreal. Atherosclerotic disease, in which plaque buildup narrows the brain arteries, is one of the most common causes of strokes. Neurosurgeons performing EDAS reroute arteries from the scalp and the membranes that cover the brain and place these arteries under the skull near areas of the brain at risk of stroke. Over time, new blood vessels form, creating fresh pathways for blood and oxygen to reach the brain. The trial, led by Nestor R. Gonzalez, MD, professor of Neurosurgery and director of the Neurovascular Laboratory at Cedars-Sinai, enrolled 52 patients with severe brain atherosclerosis, also known as intracranial atherosclerotic disease, or ICAD, who showed symptoms of either a recent stroke or a mini-stroke, called a transient ischemic attack. These patients received EDAS surgery, along with intensive medical management, which included diet and lifestyle changes, blood thinners and other medications to control blood pressure, cholesterol and blood sugar levels. After one year, 9.6 percent of the patients treated with the surgery experienced another ischemic stroke or died, compared with 21.2 percent of patients in a matched control group who received only intensive medical management. Two of the EDAS patients had small wound openings that required additional surgical interventions, but there were no intracranial hemorrhages or other serious adverse events, the researchers reported. ""Our findings in this intermediate-stage trial are promising for applying EDAS surgery to intracranial atherosclerotic disease,"" said Gonzalez said. Previously, EDAS has been used for moyamoya disease, a rare cerebrovascular disorder that affects younger patients. Gonzalez said the new trial addressed a serious medical need. ""Even under the best current treatments, ICAD carries high rates of recurrent stroke and death, compared with other causes of stroke,"" he said. ""Developing new therapeutic strategies is crucial for ICAD patients."" Current ICAD therapies--in addition to intensive medical management--include bypass surgery to connect a blood vessel from outside the brain to a vessel inside the brain, as well as angioplasty with stenting, which involves inflating a tiny balloon inside a cerebral artery to open it up and placing a stent device inside the artery. Despite advances in medical care, annual rates of recurrent stroke and death are remain high, at 15 percent or more for ICAD patients, according to published research. Gonzalez said his team is working with the stroke prevention working group of the National Institutes of Health to develop a proposal for a Phase III randomized clinical trial across multiple institutions to further test the effectiveness of EDAS as compared with intensive medical management. While this Phase IIa trial selected patients from previous studies as the control group, the Phase III study would enroll new ICAD patients for both the control and experimental groups, he explained. ""This clinical trial moves us significantly closer to preventing strokes and death in high-risk populations,"" said Keith Black, MD, professor and chair of the Department of Neurosurgery. ""As a nationally renowned physician-investigator, Dr. Gonzalez personifies the dedication of Cedars-Sinai to translating the most advanced research into new cures."" ### Besides Gonzalez, the trial involved other investigators from the stroke centers of Cedars-Sinai and UCLA.

"UK researchers behind a potential 'universal' liquid biopsy blood test for cancer detection have licensed the technology to an industrial partner to take it to market. The research team believes that the test could be the first screening tool to 'rule in, or rule out' cancer in patients under suspicion of the disease, alongside other traditional diagnostics methods. The test was developed at the University of Bradford, UK. It measures the damage to the DNA of white blood cells when subjected to different intensities of ultraviolet (UV) light, revealing measurable differences in the cells' susceptibility to further damage in patients with cancer. The damage forms a 'comet tail' of DNA pieces that are pulled towards the positive end of an electric field. The longer the comet tail, the more DNA damage is present, which correlates with the presence of cancer. In a 2014 proof of concept study, the Bradford researchers showed they could identify which samples were from patients with three different types of cancer - even those who had yet to be diagnosed - with 93 per cent success. However, in their two most recent clinical trials of the test involving over 700 blood samples from colorectal and prostate cancer patients (and further breast and lung cancer samples that were available), they were unable to distinguish those with cancer from healthy patients in 60 cases. To determine whether scoring more cells on the slides would explain this 'challenging subgroup', lead researcher Professor Diana Anderson from the University of Bradford asked IMSTAR, to reanalyse the inconclusive slides. The Bradford team had scored 100 cells per slide, but the Pathfinder™ system is able to analyse up to 10,000 cells per slide, and uses Artificial Intelligence concepts in its proprietary software. Scoring a minimum of 2,000 cells per slide, the IMSTAR Pathfinder™ system was able to separate all individuals of the cancer group from the healthy control group with confirmed statistical significance. These findings are published in FASEB BioAdvances journal. Professor Anderson said: ""This test is different from other universal cancer tests being developed, because it is not looking for a specific biomarker or mutation. This is a generic test for cancer in an individual, regardless of the underlying mechanism that's causing their cancer. ""I'm now convinced that if we used the powerful IMSTAR system to look at thousands of cells on all the slide samples in the trials, we would see a significant increase in the overall predictability beyond the original 93 per cent of the original 2014 study."" Paris-based company IMSTAR has now coupled the innovative technology developed at Bradford with their fully-automated Pathfinder™ cell reader-analyser to create a powerful and robust test for early detection, called TumorScan™. Co-first author Dr Mojgan Najafzadeh from the University of Bradford said: ""We feel that we've taken it as far as we can in proving that the test works with high predictability for cancer outcome, and IMSTAR are the right partners to improve it still further."" Dr Francoise Soussaline, PhD, DSc, IMSTAR's president said: ""To bring a universal 'liquid biopsy' blood test for cancer to market, it must achieve a number of criteria, including high sensitivity and specificity and be fully automated with high throughput for a medical routine use. In addition, test results must be available in 24hrs and at affordable cost. ""We believe that the combination of Bradford's innovation and IMSTAR's unique expertise has shown that TumorScan can achieve these requisites."" IMSTAR's vice-president for medical applications, Dr Michel Soussaline, confirmed that the company will be working to automate the full test workflow further to take it to market. ###",0,news_reviews_00022
"NEW YORK -- Treatment with a HER2-targeted therapeutic cancer vaccine provided clinical benefit to several patients with metastatic HER2-positive cancers who had not previously been treated with a HER2-targeted therapeutic, according to data from a phase I clinical trial presented at the Fourth CRI-CIMT-EATI-AACR International Cancer Immunotherapy Conference: Translating Science into Survival, held Sept. 30-Oct. 3. Among 11 evaluable patients who had received more than the lowest dose of the vaccine, six (54 percent) had clinical benefit. One patient with ovarian cancer had a complete response that lasted 89 weeks, one patient with gastroesophageal cancer had a partial response that lasted 16 weeks, and four patients (two with colon cancer, one with prostate cancer, and one with ovarian cancer) had stable disease. ""Immunotherapy marshals the exquisite specificity of the immune system to destroy cancer, and some types may have potentially fewer side effects than traditional chemotherapy,"" said Jay A. Berzofsky, MD, PhD, chief of the Vaccine Branch at the Center for Cancer Research, National Cancer Institute, National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, Maryland. ""We are using a vaccine approach to generate an immune response to HER2, which is found at high levels on and drives the growth of several types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, lung, colorectal, and gastroesophageal cancers. ""Our results suggest that we have a very promising vaccine for HER2-overexpressing cancers,"" continued Berzofsky. ""We hope that one day the vaccine will provide a new treatment option for patients with these cancers."" The patients' vaccines are individually customized by Berzofsky and colleagues using their own immune cells isolated from their blood. The blood-derived immune cells are modified in several ways in the laboratory. The final product, which is administered intradermally (between the layers of the skin), comprises patient-derived dendritic cells genetically modified with an adenovirus to produce parts of the HER2 protein. Preclinical studies, which were previously published in the AACR journal Cancer Research, showed that this type of vaccine could eradicate large, established tumors as well as lung metastases in mice. In the dose escalation portion of the phase I clinical trial, patients were injected with the vaccine on weeks 0, 4, 8, 16, and 24 after enrollment in the study. Among the six patients who received the lowest dose of the vaccine, 5 million dendritic cells per injection, no clinical benefit was seen. Among the 11 patients who received either 10 million or 20 million dendritic cells per injection, six had clinical benefit. Adverse reactions were predominantly injection-site reactions that did not require treatment. No cardiotoxicity was seen. ""Based on the current safety and clinical benefit data, the dose of the vaccine was increased to 40 million dendritic cells per injection and the trial opened to patients who have previously been treated with a HER2-targeted therapeutic, including patients with breast cancer,"" said Berzofsky. ""Moving forward, we would like to investigate whether we can increase the proportion of people who benefit from treatment with the vaccine by combining it with checkpoint inhibitor therapy,"" he added. According to Berzofsky, the main scientific limitation of the study is that it is a relatively small, phase I clinical trial with no placebo control. However, the approach is sufficiently promising to warrant additional trials. ### This study was supported by intramural funds from the National Cancer Institute. Berzofsky declares no conflicts of interest.",0,news_reviews_00027
"GALVESTON, Texas -Researchers from The University of Texas Medical Branch at Galveston found that testosterone replacement therapy may slow disease progression of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The paper is currently available in Chronic Respiratory Disease. Chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, or COPD, is predicted by the World Health Organization to be the third-leading cause of illness and death internationally by 2030. Low testosterone is common in men with COPD and may worsen their condition. Men with COPD have shortness of breath and often take steroid-based medications for an extended time, both of which increase their risk of low testosterone. ""Previous studies have suggested that testosterone replacement therapy may have a positive effect on lung function in men with COPD,"" said Jacques Baillargeon, UTMB professor in preventive medicine and community health. ""However, we are the first to conduct a large scale nationally representative study on this association."" The goal of the study was to find out whether testosterone replacement therapy reduced the risk of respiratory hospitalizations in middle-aged and older men with COPD. Using the Clinformatics Data Mart, a database of one of the largest commercially insured populations in the U.S., Baillargeon and colleagues examined data of 450 men aged 40 to 63 with COPD who began testosterone replacement therapy between 2005 and 2014. They also used the national Medicare database to study data from 253 men with COPD aged 66 and older who initiated testosterone replacement therapy between 2008 and 2013. ""We found that testosterone users had a greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users. Specifically, middle-aged testosterone replacement therapy users had a 4.2 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users and older testosterone replacement therapy users had a 9.1 percent greater decrease in respiratory hospitalizations compared with non-users,"" said Baillargeon.

"REHOVOT, Israel, Sept. 6, 2018 /PRNewswire/ -- Nucleix Ltd., a leading cancer detection company, announced today positive results from a clinical study designed to evaluate its innovative Lung EpiCheck™, a blood test for early detection of lung cancer. The results will be presented in a poster presentation titled Lung EpiCheck ™ - Results of the Training and Test Sets of a Methylation-Based Blood Test for Early Detection of Lung Cancer at the IASLC 19th World Conference on Lung Cancer hosted by the International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer, to take place on September 22-26, 2018 in Toronto, Canada. In the study, blood was prospectively collected from 20 centers and 3 biobanks in Europe and Israel. The samples were used for detection of lung cancer with the Lung EpiCheck blood test. Lung EpiCheck was validated on this independent test set comprising 181 lung cancer cases and 141 current or former smoker controls. Results show specificity of 91% and a sensitivity of 74% with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 89%. These results demonstrated similar performance to the preceding training set results from 102 lung cancer cases and 265 current or former smoker controls. In particular, in the non-small-cell lung carcinoma group (n=162), the most prevalent type of lung cancer affecting about 85% of lung cancer patients, Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly approximately 70% of patients. With a correct identification of 59% of stage I patients, 77% of stage II, 76% of stage III and 83% of stage IV patients. In the small cell lung cancer group (n=13), Lung EpiCheck was able to identify correctly 92% of the patients, with a sensitivity of 100% in the limited stage, and 86% at the extensive stage. ""Lung cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer worldwide due to the high incidence of the disease, and the low rate of diagnosis at early and more curable stages,"" stated Prof. Mina Gaga, the President of the European Respiratory Society (ERS) and a lead investigator in the study. ""Clearly, we must establish screening programs for lung cancer worldwide. At the moment, low-dose computerized tomography (LDCT) screening which has been shown to reduce mortality from lung cancer in the very large NLST study is only reimbursed in the US for high-risk individuals. LDCT screening is not reimbursed in Europe or most areas in the world while there is still a debate about its cost and safety. Screening is however necessary in order to identify lung cancer at early, operable, stages for the entire at-risk population so currently, not only CT screening but also methods of molecular screening are being tested. I am therefore very encouraged with the results of this study, showing that EpiCheck has the ability to identify both non-small-cell and small-cell lung cancer at early stages, with a high level of sensitivity and specificity. Such promising results combined with the simplicity of the test, could allow us to detect lung cancer at the early stages and hence improve 5-year survival from about 15% to about 50-70%. This will offer significant added value in the fight against lung cancer."" ""We are very excited to present the best published clinically validated results of a blood test for the early detection of lung cancer,"" said Opher Shapira, PhD, CEO of Nucleix. ""Furthermore, these results were validated prospectively in an independent cohort. Currently, early stage lung cancer can be detected either accidentally, when testing for other conditions, or by using low-dose CT scans, which are costly, carry associated risks such as high radiation, and are employed only for a very high-risk population. Early detection of lung cancer can be a game-changer in the fight against this devastating disease, and we are looking forward to begin extensive clinical trials in the US, Europe and China next year, in order to get the test to the market as soon as possible at an affordable price."" About Lung EpiCheck The Lung EpiCheck blood test is based on a proprietary molecular biomarker technology, which combines new biochemical assays and sophisticated algorithms. The technology is based on identification and analysis of subtle changes in DNA methylation patterns, a powerful tool for distinguishing between cancer and healthy cells and thus for detection of tumors in the body. Dying tumor cells release cell-free DNA (cfDNA) into the blood, where cancer-specific methylation changes can be detected at any disease stage. The Lung EpiCheck blood test detects changes in DNA methylation in 6 markers in cfDNA associated with lung cancer. About Lung Cancer Lung cancer is the deadliest and most common of all cancer types. It is estimated that there are about 1.8 million new cases of lung cancer annually worldwide and about 1.55 million die from the disease each year. The reason for the high mortality rate is that currently most cases are detected when the patient becomes symptomatic, which is usually at late stages of the disease. To date, there is no adequate screening process for the early detection of lung cancer, bringing 5-year survival rate to approximately 15%. In addition, there is a well-defined risk group for developing the disease – mostly smokers and former smokers above the age of 50. In the US, low-dose CT is available for screening of individuals 55-79 years old who smoked at least 1 pack a day for 30 years, which represent less than half of the lung cancer population. Therefore, a screening test aimed at the entire risk group to assist in the early detection of the disease is highly needed and can dramatically increase lung cancer survival.

"A translational research team led by the National University of Singapore (NUS) has harnessed CURATE.AI, a powerful artificial intelligence (AI) platform, to successfully treat a patient with advanced cancer, completely halting disease progression. This new development represents a big step forward in personalised medicine. In this clinical study, a patient with metastatic castration-resistant prostate cancer (MCRPC) was given a novel drug combination consisting of investigational drug ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide, an approved prostate cancer drug. The research team successfully utilised CURATE.AI to continuously identify the optimal doses of each drug to result in a durable response, allowing the patient to resume a completely normal and active lifestyle. ""Dynamic dosing in cancer therapy is not commonly used. In fact, drug dosing changes in oncology are typically performed only to reduce toxicity. CURATE.AI uniquely modifies drug dosing to increase efficacy. Our clinical study has shown that dosing can profoundly affect the efficacy and safety of treatment. A patient's clinical profile changes over time. The unique ability for CURATE.AI to rapidly identify the drug doses that result in the best possible treatment outcomes allows for actionable, and perpetually optimised personalised medicine,"" explained Professor Dean Ho, Director of the Singapore Institute for Neurotechnology (SINAPSE) at NUS, who led the study. Combating cancer with combination therapy Combination therapy represents a cornerstone in modern cancer treatment. Using this approach, multiple drugs are used to attack the processes that support cancer growth. A primary objective when designing combination therapies is to achieve drug synergy, where the drugs work together to substantially improve efficacy. While combination therapy has generally improved treatment outcomes such as overall survival for many cancers, it is predominantly given at both fixed as well as high doses. Prof Ho added, ""Patients respond to chemotherapy differently from one another. Even a single patient's response to therapy can vary substantially over the course of treatment. In fact, many patients do not respond at all to the drug combination because the dosages, which can profoundly impact efficacy, are not suitable for them. Therefore, while fixed dose combination therapy represents a standard of care, it may also serve as a barrier to realising truly optimal and personalised medicine."" Harnessing AI to continuously optimise combination therapy dosing To overcome the challenges of conventional combination therapy, the NUS team of engineers developed the CURATE.AI platform, which uses the patient's own clinical data - such as their drug doses and corresponding changes to tumour sizes or levels of cancer biomarkers in the blood - to calibrate his or her unique response to treatment. This calibration is then used to create an individualised CURATE.AI profile, or map, that identifies the drug doses which enable the best possible treatment outcome at any given point in time. ""No two patients' profiles are alike, and as a patient's body and the cancer itself evolve during treatment, the CURATE.AI profile evolves as well, enabling the clinical and engineering teams to optimise care for the entire duration of treatment, an unprecedented advance for combination therapy,"" Prof Ho explained. In this study, which was conducted at the UCLA Institute of Urologic Oncology for a period of over a year, a patient with metastatic prostate cancer was given ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Reducing the level of prostate specific antigen (PSA) in the patient's blood served as the primary biomarker to determine if the patient was responding to treatment. Computed tomography (CT) imaging of the cancer lesions monitored the extent of disease progression. Initially, the doses of ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide were adjusted by the clinicians to better manage patient-reported quality of life. The patient's initial drug doses and PSA levels were then used to construct his personalised CURATE.AI profile. Remarkably, CURATE.AI subsequently identified a ZEN-3694 dose that was 50 per cent lower than the patient's starting dose of the drug prior to CURATE.AI analysis. Prospective dosage guidance by CURATE.AI resulted in the lowest PSA levels observed for the patient during the course of the study. As treatment progressed, slight increases in ZEN-3694 dosing resulted in clear decreases in PSA levels, also demonstrating its key role in suppressing the metastatic cancer. CT imaging of the patient's lesions showed that disease progression was halted as a result of CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy of both ZEN-3694 and enzalutamide. Patient care guided by CURATE.AI is currently ongoing. ""Using CURATE.AI to dynamically modify drug doses and successfully treat a metastatic cancer patient represents a landmark breakthrough for the use of AI to truly personalise patient care. This advance is expected to dramatically improve response rates for all combination therapies that are being developed for oncology as well as virtually all other diseases. We can also expect CURATE.AI to markedly reduce the costs of drug development,"" Prof Ho added. Dr Allan Pantuck, the lead clinician of the study, added, ""With fixed dose therapy, patients are often switched to other drugs when they no longer respond to treatment. However, CURATE.AI has shown that patients can still respond to the therapies that have seemingly stopped working by continuously identifying the patient's optimal dosing parameters."" ""The implementation of CURATE.AI represents a game-changing shift in the way that combination therapy can be optimised at the single patient level, and we have shown that N-of-1 medicine can be a reality. We are excited that CURATE.AI could ultimately enhance patient accessibility to important new combination therapies, saving lives in the process,"" said Prof Ho, who is also from the Biomedical Engineering and Pharmacology departments at NUS, as well as a member of the Biomedical Institute for Global Health Research and Technology (BIGHEART) at NUS. The research was conducted in collaboration with the University of California, Los Angeles, and Zenith Epigenetics. The findings were published in Advanced Therapeutics on 29 August 2018. More clinical trials underway CURATE.AI is applicable to all diseases and all patients, and a first generation of the platform was previously validated in the clinic for single drug optimisation in post-transplant immunosuppression. This new study demonstrates that CURATE.AI can optimise multi-drug regimens. Multiple clinical trials using CURATE.AI-guided combination therapy for oncology and additional applications such as post-transplant immunosuppression are underway. In addition, patient recruitment for additional oncology trials in Singapore has been approved. The CURATE.AI team expects to broadly deploy the platform for the prevention of transplant rejection, adult and paediatric cancers, cardiovascular medicine, diabetes management, infectious diseases, and many other applications. ###",1,news_reviews_00038
"San Francisco--A new study, presented today at the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery's (SNIS) 15th Annual Meeting, found that new stroke imaging technology could decrease delays in care by up to 60 minutes, giving patients a better chance at making a full recovery. The study, New Multiple CT Assessment of Acute Stroke Patients: Are We Ready for Prime Time?, shows that recent advances in imaging software in the angiosuite give neurointerventionalists the essential details required to diagnose a patient with large vessel occlusion (LVO) for an endovascular thrombectomy (EVT). This study suggests that in the future, stroke patients can bypass the CT scan or emergency department and go directly to the angiosuite for imaging and proper care. ""By using this technology in the angiosuite, hospitals can reduce intra-facility transfer delays and hence the time of stroke symptom onset to treatment, which will significantly reduce brain damage and improve outcomes for patients,"" said Nicole Cancelliere, lead author of the study and an interventional clinical research technologist at Toronto Western Hospital. The time required to transfer a patient from their CT scan to the operating room could delay EVT by as long as 60 minutes. Preliminary results show that the cone beam imaging software compares favorably with baseline and follow-up CT scans. The imaging allows accurate detection of hemorrhage, occlusion site, ischemic core, and tissue at risk, suggesting that baseline imaging can be performed in the angiosuite using cone beam imaging. The lead PI on this study, Professor Vitor Mendes Pereira, concluded by saying, ""By reducing intra-facility transfer times, patients can receive EVT treatment sooner, which can significantly impact patient outcomes"". ### About the Society of NeuroInterventional Surgery",1,news_reviews_00051

"(Philadelphia, PA) - Reversing memory deficits and impairments in spatial learning is a major goal in the field of dementia research. A lack of knowledge about cellular pathways critical to the development of dementia, however, has stood in the way of significant clinical advance. But now, researchers at the Lewis Katz School of Medicine at Temple University (LKSOM) are breaking through that barrier. They show, for the first time in an animal model, that tau pathology - the second-most important lesion in the brain in patients with Alzheimer's disease - can be reversed by a drug. ""We show that we can intervene after disease is established and pharmacologically rescue mice that have tau-induced memory deficits,"" explained senior investigator Domenico Praticò, MD, Scott Richards North Star Foundation Chair for Alzheimer's Research, Professor in the Departments of Pharmacology and Microbiology, and Director of the Alzheimer's Center at Temple at LKSOM. The study, published online in the journal Molecular Neurobiology, raises new hope for human patients affected by dementia. The researchers landed on their breakthrough after discovering that inflammatory molecules known as leukotrienes are deregulated in Alzheimer's disease and related dementias. In experiments in animals, they found that the leukotriene pathway plays an especially important role in the later stages of disease. ""At the onset of dementia, leukotrienes attempt to protect nerve cells, but over the long term, they cause damage,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""Having discovered this, we wanted to know whether blocking leukotrienes could reverse the damage, whether we could do something to fix memory and learning impairments in mice having already abundant tau pathology."" To recapitulate the clinical situation of dementia in humans, in which patients are already symptomatic by the time they are diagnosed, Dr. Praticò and colleagues used specially engineered tau transgenic mice, which develop tau pathology - characterized by neurofibrillary tangles, disrupted synapses (the junctions between neurons that allow them to communicate with one another), and declines in memory and learning ability - as they age. When the animals were 12 months old, the equivalent of age 60 in humans, they were treated with zileuton, a drug that inhibits leukotriene formation by blocking the 5-lipoxygenase enzyme. After 16 weeks of treatment, animals were administered maze tests to assess their working memory and their spatial learning memory. Compared with untreated animals, tau mice that had received zileuton performed significantly better on the tests. Their superior performance suggested a successful reversal of memory deficiency. To determine why this happened, the researchers first analyzed leukotriene levels. They found that treated tau mice experienced a 90-percent reduction in leukotrienes compared with untreated mice. In addition, levels of phosphorylated and insoluble tau, the form of the protein that is known to directly damage synapses, were 50 percent lower in treated animals. Microscopic examination revealed vast differences in synaptic integrity between the groups of mice. Whereas untreated animals had severe synaptic deterioration, the synapses of treated tau animals were indistinguishable from those of ordinary mice without the disease. ""Inflammation was completely gone from tau mice treated with the drug,"" Dr. Praticò said. ""The therapy shut down inflammatory processes in the brain, allowing the tau damage to be reversed."" The study is especially exciting because zileuton is already approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the treatment of asthma. ""Leukotrienes are in the lungs and the brain, but we now know that in addition to their functional role in asthma, they also have a functional role in dementia,"" Dr. Praticò explained. ""This is an old drug for a new disease,"" he added. ""The research could soon be translated to the clinic, to human patients with Alzheimer's disease."" ### Other researchers contributing to the study include Phillip F.

"A new study published in Nutrients shows that eating just 1.5 ounces of pecans - one small handful - every day may protect adults at risk for developing cardiovascular disease (CVD) and type 2 diabetes (T2D). Conducted by researchers at the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at Tufts University, this study found that incorporating pecans into a typical American diet significantly improved insulin sensitivity and had a significant effect on markers of cardiometabolic disease in otherwise healthy overweight and obese adults with excess belly fat. While a growing body of evidence has linked tree nuts such as pecans to reduced risk of CVD, this is the first study to look at the effects of pecan consumption on factors other than blood lipid levels and specifically those related to T2D. Obesity is a risk factor for T2D, and both obesity and T2D increase CVD risk. ""Pecans are naturally high in monounsaturated and polyunsaturated fats, so replacing a portion of the saturated fat in the diet with these healthier fats can explain some of the cardio-protective effects we observed,"" said lead researcher, Diane McKay, Ph.D. ""But pecans also contain a number of bioactive plant compounds as well as vitamins and essential minerals that all likely contributed to this benefit. What's really interesting is that just one small change - eating a handful of pecans daily - may have a large impact on the health of these at-risk adults."" In this placebo-controlled crossover study of 26 men and women (average age 59 years), all meals were provided to carefully control their food intake. For four weeks at a time, subjects ate either a control diet with no nuts or the same diet with pecans substituted for 15 percent of the total calories. Both the control diet and the pecan-rich diet were low in fruits, vegetables and fiber. Calorie levels, as well as protein, carbohydrate, and total fat, were kept the same. ### The study entitled ""A Pecan-Rich Diet Improves Cardiometabolic Risk Factors in Overweight and Obese Adults: A Randomized Controlled Trial"" is available online and will be presented at the American Society for Nutrition Annual Conference, Nutrition 2018 held in Boston this June.

"Leesburg, VA, March 13, 2018 - When compared to the screening population ages 50 and over, screening mammography in women ages 40-49 detects 19.3% additional cancers at the expense of an overall 1.5% increase in callbacks and 0.1% in increased biopsies, according to a study to be presented at the ARRS 2018 Annual Meeting, set for April 22-27 in Washington, DC. The study to be presented by Abid Irshad of the Medical University of South Carolina examined the effectiveness of screening mammography between ages 40-49 in comparison to age groups 50-59 and 60-69. More than 41,000 screening mammography exams were examined for callbacks and recall rate, biopsies performed, cancers detected, and sensitivity and specificity of screening mammography. Overall, 41,028 mammograms were performed with 5,196 callbacks (12.7% recall rate), 1,164 biopsies, and 326 cancers detected. Women ages 40-49 had 8,913 mammograms, 1,518 callbacks (17% recall rate), 306 biopsies, and 52 cancers detected. Women ages 50-59 had 13,288 mammograms, 1,659 callbacks (12.5% recall rate), 371 biopsies, and 103 cancers detected, while women ages 60-69 had 12,119 mammograms, 1,239 callbacks (10.2% recall rate), 302 biopsies and 89 cancers detected. Overall, the women ages 50 and over had a total of 31,385 mammograms, 3,504 callbacks (11.2% recall rate), 836 biopsies, and 270 cancers detected. By adding the women ages 40-49 to the screening population of 50 and over, the overall callback rate increased 1.5%, the biopsy rate increased 0.1% and 19.3% more cancers were detected. The study results showed that there was a higher number of callbacks among women ages 40-49 compared to women ages 50-59 (17% compared with 12.5%) and to women ages 60-69 (17% compared with 10.2%). There was also a lower positive biopsy rate among women ages 40-49 compared with women over 50. The number of cancers detected in women ages 40-49 was not significantly different from women ages 50-59 or 60-69. ### With educational activities representing the entire spectrum of radiology, ARRS will host leading radiologists from around the world at the ARRS 2018 Annual Meeting, April 22-27, at the Marriott Wardman Park Hotel in Washington, DC.

"People with stage III colon cancer who regularly eat nuts are at significantly lower risk of cancer recurrence and mortality than those who don't, according to a new, large study led by researchers at Yale Cancer Center. The findings were published today in the Journal of Clinical Oncology. The study followed 826 participants in a clinical trial for a median of 6.5 years after they were treated with surgery and chemotherapy. Those who regularly consumed at least two, one-ounce servings of nuts each week demonstrated a 42% improvement in disease-free survival and a 57% improvement in overall survival. ""Further analysis of this cohort revealed that disease-free survival increased by 46% among the subgroup of nut consumers who ate tree nuts rather than peanuts,"" said Charles S. Fuchs, M.D., director of Yale Cancer Center and senior author of the study. Tree nuts include almonds, walnuts, hazelnuts, cashews, and pecans, among others. In contrast, peanuts are actually in the legume family of foods. ""These findings are in keeping with several other observational studies that indicate that a slew of healthy behaviors — including increased physical activity, keeping a healthy weight, and lower intake of sugar and sweetened beverages — improve colon cancer outcomes,"" said Temidayo Fadelu, M.D., a postdoctoral fellow at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and lead author of the paper. ""The results highlight the importance of emphasizing dietary and lifestyle factors in colon cancer survivorship."" Additionally, the researchers emphasized, the study highlighted connections between biological mechanisms that worsen disease not just in colon cancer but in certain chronic illnesses such as type 2 diabetes. Many previous studies have reported that nuts, among other health benefits, may help to reduce insulin resistance, a condition in which the body has difficulty processing the insulin hormone. Insulin resistance leads to unhealthy levels of sugar in the blood and is often a predecessor to type 2 diabetes and related illnesses. Earlier research among patients with colon cancer has revealed worse outcomes among those with lifestyle factors — such as obesity, lack of exercise, and a diet with high levels of carbohydrates — that heighten insulin resistance and quickly raise levels of blood sugar. ""These studies support the hypothesis that behaviors that make you less insulin-resistant, including eating nuts, seem to improve outcomes in colon cancer,"" Fuchs said. ""However, we don't know yet what exactly about nuts is beneficial."" Nuts also might play a positive role by satisfying hunger with less intake of carbohydrates or other foods associated with poor outcomes, Fuchs noted. Patients may not be eating nuts due to concerns about the high fat content, said Fuchs. For example, a one-ounce serving of about 24 almonds holds about 200 calories, including 14 grams of fat. ""People ask me if increasing nut consumption will lead to obesity, which leads to worse outcomes,"" he said. ""But what's really interesting is that in our studies, and across the scientific literature in general, regular consumers of nuts tend to be leaner."" Dietary changes can make a difference. An earlier analysis of diets in the same patient cohort by Fuchs and his colleagues found a significant link between coffee consumption and reduced recurrence and mortality in colon cancer. When Fuchs advises his patients about lifestyle choices, ""first and foremost I talk about avoiding obesity, exercising regularly, and staying away from a high-carbohydrate diet,"" he said. ""Then we talk about things like coffee and nuts. If you like coffee or nuts, enjoy them, and if you don't, there are many other helpful steps you can take."" ""Overall, we are working to apply the same rigorous science to the understanding of diet and lifestyles in the colon cancer patient population that we apply to defining new drugs,"" Fuchs said. Co-corresponding authors on the paper are Jeffrey Meyerhardt, M.D., of Dana-Farber and Ying Bao, M.D., of Brigham and Women's Hospital. Lead funding for the research was provided by the National Cancer Institute.

"A commonly-prescribed multiple sclerosis (MS) infusion medication linked to a rare but serious side effect is safer to use when dosing intervals are extended, according to a new study led by MS specialists NYU Langone Health. The new research showed that extending dosing of natalizumab from every 4 weeks to every 5 to 12 weeks significantly reduced the risk of developing progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML), a rare but potentially fatal brain infection. The authors presented their findings February 2 at the Americas Committee for Treatment and Research in Multiple Sclerosis (ACTRIMS) Forum 2018 in San Diego. The findings could influence how neurologists prescribe the medication. ""Neurologists have been looking for safer ways to administer natalizumab infusions to their patients, but there hasn't been clear data on whether decreasing dosing frequency improves safety,"" says first study author Lana Zhovtis Ryerson, MD, assistant professor of neurology at NYU School of Medicine and an attending neurologist at NYU Langone's Multiple Sclerosis Comprehensive Care Center. ""Our safety findings are clinically and statistically significant, and we believe that extending the dosing schedule of natalizumab is practice changing and may save lives."" Natalizumab, a monoclonal antibody, is used to prevent MS relapses, improve quality of life, and slow worsening disability. The medication is indicated to be prescribed in 300-milligram infusion doses every 4 weeks. Taking the medication longer than two years, however, may increase risk PML, which is caused by the John Cunningham virus (JCV). There have been 756 PML cases reported worldwide as of January 2018, with a global incidence rate of 4.19 per 1,000 PML cases in people treated with natalizumab. Patients who test JCV antibody-positive are typically either told to not to start natalizumab, or have had treatment stopped after two years, when risk was deemed to be too high. The new study, however, reports safety data through up to 72 months, or 6 years, when the extended dosing regimens were applied, with risk reduction for PML as high as 94 percent. How the Study Was Conducted Researchers reviewed data on all patients who have been exposed to JCV who are enrolled in TOUCH, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration-mandated Risk Evaluation and Mitigation Strategy (REMS) program for natalizumab that requires manufacturers to document all uses of a medication to ensure that the benefits of a drug outweigh its risks. Since the optimal extended dose schedule is not known, researchers chose to look at the data in multiple ways, with the primary definition looking at extended dose history in the last 18 months, the secondary definition looking at extended dose occurring at any time in the dosing history, and for tertiary definition looking primarily at how extended dose history affects PML risk. The results showed clinically and statistically significant risk reductions with all definitions. The new study did not look at drug efficacy comparing extended to standard doses. However, previous research led by Dr. Zhovtis-Ryerson's group found extending the dose up to 8 weeks did not negatively affect the medication's efficacy in a retrospective sample of 2,000 people. The authors are planning prospective efficacy studies of extended dose natalizumab. Natalizumab is manufactured by Biogen Idec and Elan, and sold under the name Tysabri®. Biogen provided the researchers access to their data and statistical support. Other infusion disease-modifying therapies approved to treat MS include the drugs alemtuzumab and ocrelizumab. Oral and injectable medications are also prescribed. ### The study was carried out in collaboration with Biogen and academic collaborators from NYU School of Medicine's Division of Biostatics, University of Alabama at Birmingham School of Medicine, and Rocky Mountain Multiple Sclerosis Clinic in Utah.

"SCS works by sending low electrical pulses, which vary in frequency, pulse width and amplitude, to the spinal cord to interrupt pain signals. Paresthesia-based therapy provides pain relief with a light tingling sensation while sub-perception therapy works without that sensation. With the Spectra WaveWriter System, patients can choose to combine both of these therapies to target one specific area of pain or use each therapy as needed to best manage multiple areas of pain. Patients provide real-time feedback using the system's remote control. Together, these features benefit patients by addressing each individual's unique pain relief needs. ""Patients suffering with chronic pain experience pain differently, and pain also evolves over time, sometimes causing a patient to become less responsive as the body becomes accustomed to treatment,"" said Dr. Giancarlo Barolat, neurosurgeon, Barolat Neuroscience, Denver, Colorado. ""Until now, the medical community has had limited options to offer personalized pain relief therapy to patients. The main advantage of the Spectra WaveWriter System is that it integrates multiple therapies into a single device so that treatment can more easily be tailored to individual needs."" The Spectra WaveWriter System was developed with more than a decade of clinical research focused on optimizing sub-perception and delivering multiple therapies intended for more effective, long-term pain relief. These studies include the WHISPER study and the PROCO study. The PROCO study was a multi-center, prospective, double-blind, randomized study in which patients acted as their own control. This study established in de novo patients that similar pain relief and improvement in quality of life measures are achieved independent of the type of frequency (from 1 kHz up to 10 kHz) used in sub-perception SCS therapy when the proper target and dose are identified. The WHISPER study is a multi-center, prospective, cross-over, randomized, and controlled study evaluating the long-term safety and effectiveness of sub-perception SCS pain relief therapy. ""We are introducing industry-leading SCS technology to help provide patients with lasting relief from chronic pain,"" said Maulik Nanavaty, president and senior vice president, Neuromodulation, Boston Scientific.

"AUGUSTA, Ga. (Jan. 2, 2018) - In just four months, high-doses of vitamin D reduce arterial stiffness in young, overweight/obese, vitamin-deficient, but otherwise still healthy African-Americans, researchers say. Rigid artery walls are an independent predictor of cardiovascular- related disease and death and vitamin D deficiency appears to be a contributor, says Dr. Yanbin Dong, geneticist and cardiologist at the Georgia Prevention Institute at the Medical College of Georgia at Augusta University. So researchers looked at baseline and again 16 weeks later in 70 African-Americans ages 13-45 - all of whom had some degree of arterial stiffness - taking varying doses of the vitamin best known for its role in bone health. In what appears to be the first randomized trial of its kind, they found that arterial stiffness was improved by vitamin D supplementation in a dose-response manner in this population, they write in the journal PLOS ONE. Overweight/obese blacks are at increased risk for vitamin D deficiency because darker skin absorbs less sunlight - the skin makes vitamin D in response to sun exposure - and fat tends to sequester vitamin D for no apparent purpose, says Dong, the study's corresponding author. Participants taking 4,000 international units - more than six times the daily 600 IUs the Institute of Medicine currently recommends for most adults and children - received the most benefit, says Dr. Anas Raed, research resident in the MCG Department of Medicine and the study's first author. The dose, now considered the highest, safe upper dose of the vitamin by the Institute of Medicine, reduced arterial stiffness the most and the fastest: 10.4 percent in four months. ""It significantly and rapidly reduced stiffness,"" Raed says. Two thousand IUs decreased stiffness by 2 percent in that timeframe. At 600 IUs, arterial stiffness actually increased slightly - .1 percent - and the placebo group experienced a 2.3 percent increase in arterial stiffness over the timeframe. They used the non-invasive, gold standard pulse wave velocity to assess arterial stiffness. Reported measures were from the carotid artery in the neck to the femoral artery, a major blood vessel, which supplies the lower body with blood. The American Heart Association considers this the primary outcome measurement of arterial stiffness. When the heart beats, it generates a waveform, and with a healthy heart and vasculature there are fewer and smaller waves. The test essentially measures the speed at which the blood is moving, and in this case, fast is not good, Raed says. ""When your arteries are more stiff, you have higher pulse wave velocity, which increases your risk of cardiometabolic disease in the future,"" says Raed. The varying doses, as well as the placebo participants took, were all packaged the same so neither they or the investigators knew which dose, if any, they were getting until the study was complete. Both placebo and supplements were given once monthly - rather than daily at home - at the GPI to ensure consistent compliance. Dong was also corresponding author on a study published in 2015 in the journal BioMed Central Obesity that showed, in this same group of individuals, both 2,000 and 4,000 IUs restored more desirable vitamin D blood levels of 30 nanograms per milliliter. The 4,000 upper-limit dose restored healthy blood level quicker - by eight weeks - and was also better at suppressing parathyroid hormone, which works against vitamin D's efforts to improve bone health by absorbing calcium, they reported. While heart disease is the leading cause of death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, blacks have higher rates of cardiovascular disease and death than whites and the disease tends to occur earlier in life. The authors write that arterial stiffness and vitamin D deficiency might be potential contributors. While just how vitamin D is good for our arteries isn't completely understood, it appears to impact blood vessel health in many ways. Laboratory studies have shown that mice missing a vitamin D receptor have higher activation of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, says Raed. Activation of this system increases blood vessel constriction, which can contribute to arterial stiffness. Vitamin D also can suppress vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation, activation of garbage-eating macrophages and calcification formation, all of which can thicken blood vessel walls and hinder flexibility. Vitamin D also reduces inflammation, an underlying mechanism for obesity related development of coronary artery disease, says Raed. Now it's time to do a larger-scale study, particularly in high-risk populations, and follow participants' progress for longer periods, Dong and Raed say. ""A year would give us even more data and ideas,"" Raed adds. Dong notes that pulse wave velocity and blood pressure measures are complimentary but not interchangeable. ""We think maybe in the future, when you go to your physician, he or she might check your arterial stiffness as another indicator of how healthy you are,"" Raed says. There were no measurable differences in weight or blood pressure measurements over the 16-week study period. The Institute of Medicine currently recommends a daily intake of 800 IUs of vitamin D for those age 70 and older. For adolescents and adults, they recommend 4,000 IUs as the upper daily limit; 2,000 was a previous upper limit. More than 80 percent of Americans, the majority of whom spend their days indoors, have vitamin D insufficiency or deficiency. Dong, an expert in vitamin D and a professor in the MCG Department of Population Health Sciences, says about 15 minutes daily in the ""young"" sun - between 10 a.m. and 2 p.m. - but before your skin starts to get pink, is the best source of vitamin D. Foods like milk, milk products like cheese and yogurt, fatty fish like mackerel and sardines, some greens like kale and collards and fortified cereals also are good sources. The researchers say a vitamin D supplement is an inexpensive and safe option for most of us. ###",0,news_reviews_00128
"Community screening for osteoporosis could prevent more than a quarter of hip fractures in older women, according to new research. A new study, published in The Lancet, has shown that a simple questionnaire, combined with bone mineral density measurements for some, would help identify those at risk of hip fracture. The research, involving more than 12,000 older women and carried out in collaboration between the universities of Birmingham, East Anglia, Bristol, Leicester, York and Sheffield, found that screening through GP practices allowed patients to be targeted for treatment. In women agreeing to participate, this led to a 28 per cent reduction in hip fractures over five years. Professor Neil Gittoes, of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Metabolism and Systems Research, said: ""Our findings showed that screening led to a statistically significant decrease in hip fractures. ""Our data has the potential to influence national policies around prevention of hip fractures, which is particularly relevant in our ageing society. The consequences of hip fractures to older people can be devastating, including impaired mobility and loss of independence. ""While we have demonstrated clinical effectiveness of screening, we are also exploring cost-effectiveness of this approach; initial analyses also look promising in this respect."" Professor Lee Shepstone, from UEA's Norwich Medical School, said: ""Approximately one in three women and one in five men aged over 50 year will suffer a fragility fracture during their remaining lifetime. In the UK around 536,000 people suffer fragility fractures each year, including 79,000 hip fractures. ""A hip fracture can be devastating with a loss of independence and less than one third of patients make a full recovery. Mortality at one-year post-fracture is approximately 20 per cent."" ""We wanted to find out whether screening, like screening for breast cancer, could help identify those at risk of suffering a fracture."" The team used a University of Sheffield developed tool called FRAX, which predicts the probability of a hip fracture or a major osteoporotic fracture (a hip, spine, upper arm or lower arm fracture), to identify older women at high risk. A total of 12,483 women aged 70-85 were recruited from 100 GP practices in seven regions -Birmingham, Bristol, Manchester, Norwich, Sheffield, Southampton, and York. Half of the women were screened to compare screening with routine care. Among those screened, treatment was subsequently recommended for one in seven women deemed at high risk of hip fracture. This recommendation was acted upon by the women and their GPs so that over three quarters of the women at high risk were on osteoporosis medications within six months of screening. While screening did not reduce the incidence of all osteoporosis-related fractures, there was strong evidence for a reduction in hip fractures. In the screening group, there were 54 fewer women who suffered one or more hip fractures compared to the routine care group. The study suggests that one hip fracture could be prevented for every 111 women screened and early analysis suggests the approach is likely to be cost-effective. Professor Shepstone added: ""This is the first trial to show that a community-screening approach based on the FRAX fracture risk tool is both feasible and effective. Given that the number of costly and debilitating hip fractures are expected to increase with an ageing population, the results of this study potentially have important public health implications."" Professor Eugene McCloskey, of the University of Sheffield, said: ""Low-cost screening with FRAX among the older population could result in effective, targeted intervention to reduce the human and socioeconomic burden of hip fractures. ""If the SCOOP screening strategy was taken up in exactly the same way as in the study in all UK women aged 70-85 years, we estimate that the strategy could prevent up to 8000 hip fractures per year in the UK. Even greater gains could be made if we could reach out to women similar to those who did not take part in the study."" The randomised controlled trial 'SCreening for Osteoporosis in Older women for the Prevention of fracture' (SCOOP) was funded by the Medical Research Council and Arthritis Research UK. Dr Natalie Carter, head of research liaison and evaluation at Arthritis Research UK, said: ""Ten of thousands of people a year present with hip fractures in the UK. As well as significantly increasing mortality, a hip fracture can stop a person's ability to live independently, with 43% no longer being able to walk independently in the year after the fracture. ""We welcome this community based screening programme and any other research that reduces the likelihood of fractures."" ### For further information or interviews contact Emma McKinney, Press Office, University of Birmingham, at +44 (0)121 414 6681 or contact the Press Office out of hours on 44-0-7789-921165.

"A new paper in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute finds that testing for cervical cancer using HPV testing in addition to the Pap smear is unlikely to detect cancer cases that wouldn't be found using HPV testing alone. The main goal of cervical screening programs is to detect and treat precancer before cancer develops. Cytology-based screening, known as the Pap test or Pap smear, is used to detect abnormal cells. The Pap test can also find noncancerous conditions, such as infections and inflammation. Cervical cancer screening guidelines have changed dramatically over the last 15 years, following introduction of testing for the dozen high-risk human papillomavirus (HPV) types that cause virtually all cervical cancer and its precursors. Despite more research into HPV, and the introduction of preventive HPV vaccines, screening will remain important and comprise many millions of tests annually for decades to come. But improved screening methods have also introduced some confusion, even controversy. HPV testing is more sensitive than the Pap test for detecting precancer. The HPV test captures the known cancer causing viruses, but there are gynecologists who believe that there may be unknown cancer causing viruses and so continue to do the Pap smear (plus HPV testing). However, reports of rare HPV-negative, Pap-test-positive cancers are motivating continued use of both tests (cotesting) despite increased testing costs. An HPV test, in which doctors test a cervicovaginal specimen for the presence of the nucleic acids of carcinogenic types of HPV, is more sensitive than the Pap test (a microscopic examination of exfoliated cells) for detection of precancers. Thus, if a single screening method were chosen to complement HPV vaccination, primary HPV testing likely would gradually supplant the Pap test. In the US, an interim guidance issued by a committee of experts from several clinical societies recommended primary HPV testing every three years, the same as the Pap test. Alternatively, current guidelines recommend cotesting but, in recognition of the additional reassurance provided by this approach compared with the Pap test alone, the screening interval is extended to every five years. Draft guidelines from the US Preventive Services Task Force recently recommended either primary HPV testing every five years or the Pap test every three years for women 30 to 64, and did not recommend cotesting. The accumulated evidence supports inclusion of HPV testing in screening; thus, the main choice moving forward is between cotesting and primary HPV testing alone. Researchers were searching for realistic performance data to quantify the additional benefit of the Pap test component of cotesting, as the costs of intensive screening of all women using two screening tests are substantial. In January 2003, just prior to US FDA approval of HPV and Pap test cotesting in mid-2003 and interim guidelines in 2004, Kaiser Permanente Northern California, a large integrated health care organization, introduced three-year cotesting in women aged 30 years and older. Kaiser Permanente has now screened over a million women by cotesting. This remains the most extensive experience of HPV testing incorporated into routine screening in the world. Researchers here quantified the detection of cervical precancer and cancer by cotesting compared with HPV testing alone at Kaiser Permanente, where 1,208,710 women have undergone triennial cervical cotesting since 2003. Screening histories preceding cervical cancers (n=623) and precancers (n=5,369) were examined to assess the relative contribution of the Pap test and HPV test components in identifying cases. The analysis found that HPV testing identified more women subsequently diagnosed with cancer and precancer than the Pap test. HPV testing was statistically significantly more likely to be positive for cancer at any time point, except within 12 months. HPV-negative/ Pap test-positive results preceded only small fractions of cases of precancer (3.5%) and cancer (5.9%); these cancers were more likely to be regional or distant stage than other cases. Given the rarity of cancers among screened women, the contribution of the Pap test to screening translated to earlier detection of at most five cases per million women per year. Two-thirds (67.9%) of women found to have cancer up to 10 years of follow-up at Kaiser Permanente were detected by the first cotest performed. The researchers conclude that the added sensitivity of cotesting versus HPV alone for detection of treatable cancer affected extremely few women.? ### The paper ""Relative Performance of HPV and Cytology Components of Cotesting in Cervical Screening"" is available at: https:/ / doi. org/ 10. 1093/ jnci/ djx225 Direct correspondence to: Mark SchiffmanDivision of Cancer Epidemiology and GeneticsNational Cancer InstituteBethesda, MD To request a copy of the study, please contact: Daniel Luzer daniel.luzer@oup.com Sharing on social media?

"Scientists working to develop a 'game-changing' new antibiotic have made a significant advance towards creating commercially viable drug treatments by producing two simplified synthetic versions of the substance which are just as potent at killing superbugs like MRSA as its natural form. The breakthrough by researchers at the University of Lincoln, UK, marks another important step to realising the potential of teixobactin in aiding the global fight against antibiotic-resistant pathogens. Teixobactin is a recently discovered natural antibiotic which many in the international scientific community believe could lead to creation of the first commercially viable new antibiotic drug in 30 years. The Lincoln team has successfully synthesized new simplified versions of teixobactin which harness the same powerful antibiotic effects in a way that could be produced on a commercial scale. Their findings are published in the Royal Society of Chemistry's journal, Chemical Science. Until now, scientists attempting to synthesise teixobactin believed they needed to use cationic (or positively charged) amino acids which bind to the bacterial target using a 'side chain'. This meant they had to use either the very rare amino acid found naturally in teixobactin, called enduracididine, or alternative ones which had lower potency against superbugs. Each amino acid sits at a specific place in teixobactin's structure, and the Lincoln team has now successfully replaced enduracididine - which holds position ten - with two alternative amino acids which are not positively charged. These amino acids lack the 'binding' part, over-turning the prior understanding that enduracididine is essential for to so-called 'target binding' to be highly potent against superbugs. With this new knowledge, synthesised versions of teixobactin can be more easily developed, taking the process from up to 30 hours to just ten minutes for a single coupling step - a significant step towards turning teixobactin into a viable new drug. Importantly, the two new simplified forms of teixobactin have also proven to have identical potency against superbugs as the natural form of teixobactin. Dr Ishwar Singh, a specialist in novel drug design and development from the University of Lincoln's School of Pharmacy, is leading the research team. He explained: ""When teixobactin was discovered it was ground breaking in itself as a new antibiotic which kills bacteria without detectable resistance including superbugs such as MRSA. We have been investigating a way to simplify the design while retaining the high potency against resistant bacteria such as MRSA. ""This simplified design and more efficient synthesise will enable work to be carried out at a commercial level. Enduracididine was severely limiting our ability to do this because of its scarcity, a complex multistep synthesis, and long and repetitive steps of between 16 and 30 hours with high failure rate and very low yields. ""We needed to make a change to the structure so that we could make the molecule more viable for drug development. We had tried replacing it with other amino acids with a similar make up, but they all were less potent in comparison to the natural form of teixobactin. Now, we have discovered that we can in fact use amino acids which are structurally different, and are commercially-available. They are also 16 times more potent than a clinically-used antibiotic in killing the superbug MRSA, and they were also highly potent against other antibiotic-resistant infections, such as vancomycin resistant enterococci, and tuberculosis."" The work builds on the success of the team's pioneering research to tackle antimicrobial resistance over the past 18 months. Dr Singh is working with colleagues from the School of Life Sciences and the School of Chemistry at the University of Lincoln to develop teixobactins into a viable drug. It has been predicted that by 2050 an additional 10 million people will succumb to drug resistant infections each year. The development of new antibiotics which can be used as a last resort when other drugs are ineffective is therefore a crucial area of study for healthcare researchers around the world. ###",0,news_reviews_00148
"Newswise — Women who need breast surgery to remove an abnormality that cannot be felt, also known as a non-palpable breast lesion, now may benefit from the convenience and comfort provided by an advanced new tissue locating technology offered at Rush University Medical Center. The SAVI SCOUT Radar Localization System helps to decrease the time a woman is in the operating room, increase the success rates of lesion removal and reduce the amount of healthy breast tissue that is removed during the procedure. Rush began offering SAVI SCOUT, which has been used in more than 50 lumpectomy surgeries, in July. SAVI SCOUT allows a radiologist to insert a radar wave reflector the size of a grain of rice in the patient's breast up to 30 days before surgery to mark the location of the lesion, as shown with ultrasound or X-ray mammography. The reflector replaces the widespread current practice of inserting a thin, hooked wire into the breast the same day as surgery. ""When there is an abnormality that we can't feel and are unable to biopsy, we have to find that lesion in surgery,"" said Dr. Andrea Madrigrano, assistant professor of surgery at Rush University Medical Center. SAVI SCOUT replaces a more inconvenient technique used since '70s Used since the 1970s, a hooked wire is placed in the breast through the skin to the abnormality using ultrasound or X-ray guidance with local anesthesia. The wire is placed into the breast to help guide the surgeon in removing the abnormality later that day. ""Until now, a patient would go to the imaging center to have the thin wire precisely placed in the breast. The woman would then be taken to the operating room area,"" Madrigrano said. Wire localization requires a high degree of coordination between radiology and surgical scheduling, which can lead to delays between placement of the wire and surgery, often requiring a woman to wait long periods of time with the wire in her breast. ""Before surgery, these patients are in a hospital gown and are walking around while this wire is in place, which obviously is less than ideal for the patient,"" Madrigrano said. ""The radar reflector is a replacement for the wire and is essentially a little marker. After the patient receives a local anesthetic, it can be placed into the breast using an extremely thin needle under image guidance days or weeks prior to surgery. Because this important step is out of the way in advance, it completely changes the patient's day of surgery experience."" Radar can target abnormality within 1 mm, sparing more healthy tissue Unlike mastectomy, which treats breast cancer by removing an entire breast, lumpectomy surgery — also known as breast-conserving surgery — is used to remove only the tumor and a small amount of tissue surrounding the tumor. Using the SAVI SCOUT system technology, which emits 50 million radar pulses per second, surgeons can target the affected tissue within 1 millimeter of the reflector. ""When Madrigrano told me about it, I thought it was an ingenious idea and I'm glad it was developed,"" said Nancy Morrissey, who underwent lumpectomy surgery at Rush in July using the SAVI SCOUT technology. ""It made surgery go smoothly, and I didn't have any pain before or after. ""When the marker was inserted near the lump, it was similar to a biopsy. I was glad it was done a week before and not the same day as the lumpectomy surgery. I have been very impressed with the experience."" According to Cianna Medical, the company that created SAVI SCOUT, 70 percent of women return to work the next day after the SCOUT procedure. In addition to enhancing the patient's surgical experience, the more precise localization of the surgical site enable surgeons to plan the procedure better. That advantage may lead to less tissue needing to be removed and a better appearance of the breast after surgery. ""Ultimately, this wireless technology has the potential to reduce surgical delays, and more importantly will benefit patients by increasing comfort and satisfaction during a stressful time,"" Madrigrano said.",0,news_reviews_00151
"October 26, 2017 - For younger patients with severe damage to the rotator cuff muscles, a ""reverse"" shoulder replacement provides lasting improvement in shoulder function, according to a study in The Journal of Bone & Joint Surgery. The journal is published in partnership with Wolters Kluwer. ""In the absence of treatment alternatives, reverse total shoulder arthroplasty [RTSA] is a justifiable treatment for patients with a massive, irreparable rotator cuff tear before the age of 60,"" according to the report by Christian Gerber, MD, of the University of Zurich and colleagues. Despite a substantial risk of complications, most patients are satisfied with the outcomes of RTSA at follow-ups of a decade or longer. Stable Long-Term Results of RTSA in Patients Younger than 60 The researchers analyzed the long-term outcomes of RTSA in 20 patients, average age 57 years. All had ""massive, irreparable"" tears of the rotator cuff muscles, causing shoulder ""pseudoparalysis,""with little no ability to lift the arm. This group of patients typically gets limited benefit from shoulder replacement with conventional implants, which rely on the rotator cuff muscles to provide shoulder movement. The RTSA technique--using an implant in which the natural locations of the shoulder ""ball and socket"" are reversed--uses other muscles to move the shoulder, providing an alternative when the rotator cuff is severely damaged or destroyed. When first introduced, RTSA was performed mainly in elderly patients who placed low demands on the shoulder. With refinements in technique and components in more recent years, the procedure has been used in younger, more active patients. But there are concerns about how well the results of RTSA will hold up over time in this group of patients. The new study focused on long-term outcomes of RTSA in patients under age 60. The patients underwent follow-up examination between eight and 19 years after surgery (average 11.7 years). Three patients had RTSA in both shoulders, for a total of 23 procedures. Compared to their preoperative status, most patients had substantial long-term improvement after RTSA. The average Constant score--a standard assessment accounting for shoulder motion, strength, daily activities, and pain--at the time of final-follow-up improved from 24 to 59 (out of a possible 100). Patients' ratings of ""subjective shoulder value"" improved from 20 percent to 71 percent (compared to 100 percent for a normal shoulder). Shoulder movement and strength increased, while pain decreased. The improvement was similar for patients with and without prior shoulder surgery. However, complications occurred in 39 percent of the shoulders. Further surgery was required in six shoulders; in two cases, the RTSA procedure was considered a failure. When complications occurred, long-term shoulder functioning was not as good but even with the high complication rate, 72 percent of patients rated their satisfaction level as excellent or good. The results alleviate concerns that the clinical benefits of RTSA might not hold up over time in younger, more active patients. Despite its high complication rate, Dr. Gerber and colleagues conclude that RTSA ""provides substantial and lasting improvement"" in shoulder function and pain, in a group of patients with limited treatment options. ### Click here to read ""Reverse Total Shoulder Arthroplasty for Massive, Irreparable Rotator Cuff Tears Before the Age of 60 Years: Long-Term Results.""

"Genetic test could help fight secondary breast cancer New genetic test could benefit thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours Bone strengthening drugs can help prevent the disease from spreading to the bone Thousands of breast cancer patients at risk of developing aggressive secondary tumours could benefit from a potential new genetic test. A study led by researchers at the University of Sheffield has shown women with breast cancer who lack a key genetic marker are more likely to respond to a treatment that can prevent the disease spreading to their bones. Secondary cancer, known as metastasis, is the most common cause of death in breast cancer patients as there are few effective treatments once it has taken root. It occurs when cancer cells spread to another site in the body. Around 70 per cent of secondary breast cancer patients have tumours in the bone. Large scale clinical trials indicate a group of bone strengthening drugs known as bisphosphonates can help prevent the disease from spreading to bone in breast cancer patients if given early enough. ""The difficulty is identifying which patients will benefit from these drugs,"" said Professor Robert Coleman, emeritus professor of medical oncology who led the new study. ""It only seems to be effective in some patients, particularly older women, while others show no response and in some younger women it may even be harmful."" The new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, has shown it may be possible to identify women who will benefit from bisphosphonates by using a test that looks for a gene known as MAF. Women who do not carry the gene - approximately 80 per cent of women with breast cancer - were found to benefit from the bone strengthening treatment. Professor Coleman said: ""If the test is negative for this gene, then they can be offered this bone strengthening treatment, which can give them a better chance of surviving their cancer."" A test for the gene, known as MAFTest, has been developed by a Spanish medical company called Inbiomotion following work conducted at the Institute for Research in Biomedicine (IRB) in Barcelona. The new study, which is published in the journal Lancet Oncology, was part of an international phase 3 clinical trial involving 3,360 women with stage II or III breast cancer. The results need to be confirmed in a second trial, currently underway in the United States, before the test is likely to receive approval for wider use in patients. But if successful, it could be incorporated into the routine testing of breast cancer patients to see if they could benefit from bisphosphonate treatments such as zoledronic acid. Those found not to carry the gene could be given the drug after having surgery and radiotherapy for their primary tumour in an effort to prevent the cancer from spreading. Around 50,000 women are diagnosed with breast cancer in the UK each year and the disease claims the lives of 11,500 annually. ""The discovery made at IRB Barcelona and tested in the current study could be of great use to clinicians and would avoid unnecessary treatment of patients who would not benefit or could be harmed by the treatment,"" added Professor Roger Gomis, leader of the growth control and cancer metastasis group at IRB Barcelona, who was a co-author on the study.

"ViewRay, Inc. (Nasdaq: VRAY), maker of the world's first and only clinical MRI-guided radiation therapy system, announced today outcomes data presented during the recent 2017 Annual Meeting of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). This data highlighted compelling early results using the company's MRIdian system for the treatment of inoperable, locally advanced pancreatic cancer. Unlike any other system on the market today, MRIdian allows clinicians to see the tumor and nearby soft-tissue anatomy throughout radiation treatments using real-time diagnostic MR-visualization. As a result, MRIdian's on-table adaptive radiation therapy allows doctors to respond to subtle anatomical changes observed on a day-to-day basis and reshape the dose to better match the current contours of the tumor. By more accurately targeting the tumor, and reducing treatment radiation dose to surrounding organs such as the duodenum, small bowel, stomach and liver, a higher and potentially more effective radiation dose may be delivered without increasing the risks of side effects and complications for the patient. As featured in the ASTRO Scientific Session poster titled ""High Dose Adaptive MRI Guided Radiation Therapy Improves Overall Survival of Inoperable Pancreatic Cancer,"" key data points and findings from the presentation include the following: The study detailed a retrospective review of 42 locally-advanced pancreatic cancer patients treated with MRIdian at four institutions (University of California Los Angeles, University of Wisconsin, VU University Medical Center, Washington University). The authors examined survival and toxicity rates for two unique cohorts of patients. One sample received a higher biologically effective dose (maxBED10 >90), primarily enabled by MRIdian MR-guided on-table adaptive radiotherapy. The other sample received a lower, more conventional biologically effective dose (maxBED10 <90), using non-adaptive therapy. The cohort receiving a higher dose demonstrated a near doubling of median overall survival (Kaplan-Meier estimated median overall survival of 27.8 months compared to 14.8 months). Patients treated with higher radiation doses reported no grade 3 or higher toxicities (0 percent). In comparison, those patients receiving lower doses via non-adaptive treatments experienced 15.8 percent grade 3 or higher toxicities. ""High-definition MR now enables oncologists to detect the slightest anatomical changes that occur from one day to the next and in real-time while the patient is being treated. Coupled with new adaptive radiation therapy software tools, we create new customized plans in minutes, all while the patient is on the treatment table,"" said Percy Lee, M.D., senior author and Associate Professor and Vice Chair of Education for the Department of Radiation Oncology at the David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA. ""The data presented at the 2017 ASTRO Annual Meeting suggests that higher radiation doses with adaptive MR guided radiation therapy may improve survival in pancreatic cancer while maintaining a very favorable toxicity profile. These outcomes warrant further investigations."" The early results highlighted above, along with other data obtained using MRIdian will be tested in a multi-center, prospective, single-arm clinical trial for inoperable, locally advanced or borderline resectable pancreatic cancer. The trial will be conducted by ViewRay's Clinical Cooperative Think Tank (C2T2), a group of MRIdian medical institutions focused on evidence gathering to support MR-guided radiation therapy. ### For more information regarding this clinical trial, please visit http://go. viewray. com/ pancreatic_cancer_trial_info .

"Up to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting without otherwise having to count calories helps fight obesity and other metabolic disorders. Such fasting already shows benefits after only six weeks. This is according to a study by Kyoung-Han Kim and Yun Hye Kim in the journal Cell Research which is published by Springer Nature. Intermittent fasting in mice helped to kick-start the animals' metabolism and to burn fat by generating body heat. The research team was led by Hoon-Ki Sung of The Hospital for Sick Children in Ontario, Canada. Research has shown that our unhealthy eating habits and sedentary lifestyles are playing a major role in the development of lifestyle-related metabolic diseases such as diabetes, heart disease and obesity. For this reason, dietary interventions like intermittent fasting are gaining popularity to treat conditions such as obesity. The research team in this study wanted to better understand the reactions that interventions such as fasting trigger on a molecular level in the body. They exposed groups of mice to sixteen weeks of intermittent fasting. The recurring regimen saw the animals being fed for two days, followed by one day without anything to eat. Their calorie intake was not adjusted otherwise. Four months later the mice in the fasting group weighed less than those in the control group who continued to eat the same volume of food. The lower body weight of the mice in the fasting group was not the only effect. The fasting regime helped lower fat build-up in the white fat by increasing the brown-like fat (involved in burning energy and producing body heat) of mice on the high fat diet. Their glucose and insulin systems also remained more stable. In a further experiment, similar benefits were already seen after only six weeks of intermittent fasting. Through an analysis into the underlying biology involved, the researchers found that such intermittent fasting tempers an immune reaction in fat cells. There are changes in certain gene pathways involved in the immune system and the body's reaction to inflammation. A type of white blood cell known to play a role in fighting inflammation is triggered. Known as anti-inflammatory macrophages, these cells stimulate the fat cells to burn stored fats or lipids by generating heat. This happens during periods of intermittent fasting because there is an increase in vascular growth factor (VEGF) that help form blood vessels and activate anti-inflammatory macrophage. ""Intermittent fasting without a reduction in calorie intake can be a preventative and therapeutic approach against obesity and metabolic disorders,"" says Kyoung-Han Kim. ""Strikingly, these fasting-stimulated changes in the growth of vascular cells and subsequent immune alterations occur even after a single cycle of 24-hour fasting, and are completely reversed when mice start eating again,"" adds Yun Hye Kim. ### Reference: Kim, K-H. et al (2017).

"Widely available ibuprofen is a better choice for pain relief in children who have undergone minor orthopedic outpatient surgery, as it has fewer adverse effects compared with oral morphine, according to results from a clinical trial published in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal). ""This result suggests that adequate pain management should be an important goal of care, even after minor outpatient surgery, and that more effective pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic strategies should be explored,"" writes Dr. Naveen Poonai, Clinician Scientist, Lawson Health Research Institute, and Associate Professor, Emergency Medicine, Department of Paediatrics, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, with coauthors. The study included 154 children aged 5 to 17 years who underwent minor orthopedic surgery, such as keyhole surgery on joints, ligament and tendon repair, suture or hardware removal at London Health Sciences Centre in London, Ontario. In the first 24 hours, more than 80% of the children in the study needed pain relief at home. Pain scores for children in both the oral morphine and ibuprofen groups were similar, but the children receiving oral morphine reported more adverse effects, such as nausea, vomiting, drowsiness, dizziness and constipation. ""Morphine did not provide superior analgesia, but was associated with significantly more adverse effects, making ibuprofen a better analgesic option,"" write the authors. They note that as neither treatment completely relieved pain, more research is needed into effective pain relief, especially for more severe pain. Oral morphine use at home has not been previously studied in children who have had minor surgery nor has it been compared with ibuprofen. ### The study was conducted by researchers from London Health Sciences Centre, Schulich School of Medicine & Dentistry, Western University, London, Ontario; Women and Children's Health Research Institute, University of Alberta, Edmonton, Alberta; and Children's Hospital of Wisconsin, Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

"WASHINGTON, DC (Oct. 2, 2017) -- An intensive text messaging program provides some pregnant women help in fighting the urge to light up a smoke, according to a study out today. ""Our findings show that a text messaging program helped some groups of pregnant women quit smoking during pregnancy,"" says lead author Lorien C. Abroms, ScD, MA, an associate professor of prevention and community health at Milken Institute School of Public Health (Milken Institute SPH) at the George Washington University. ""The study's findings suggest a potential new quitting strategy, especially for those later in their pregnancies and older pregnant women."" The researchers recruited pregnant women who were already enrolled in an established text messaging program called Text4baby. Text4baby has been found to have a positive health impact on alcohol consumption during pregnancy--but not smoking. Abroms and her team wanted to find out if a more intensive mobile phone program called Quit4baby would be more effective. To find out, the team recruited nearly 500 pregnant women, who smoked an average of 7 cigarettes per day and wanted more help to quit. Quit4baby is targeted to smoking cessation and sends more text messages--between 1 and 8 per day aimed at bolstering a pregnant woman's resolve to quit. The messages help educate the women about the health risks associated with smoking and they are interactive--allowing a woman to text back for more help if she is experiencing a craving or goes back to smoking. After three months, 16 percent of the women who were enrolled in both Text4baby and Quit4baby had quit compared with just 11 percent of women getting just Text4baby. However, the difference between the two groups did not reach statistical significance, the authors say. The more intensive intervention did seem to help two subgroups quit smoking at least in the short run, Abroms says. The combo of Text4baby and Quit4baby helped women age 26 and older and those in the second and third trimester of pregnancy quit through the delivery date and in some cases beyond. However, the researchers found that the resolve to quit seemed to disappear postpartum as many of these women started smoking again. Very little help is provided to pregnant smokers who want to quit so the study's findings are important, especially if the strategy can be adjusted to be more effective, Abroms says. Despite the health risks, about 10 percent of women smoke throughout their pregnancy in the United States. Additional studies must be done to find out if Quit4baby can be paired with other smoking cessation tools in order to provide long-term help for pregnant women who want to kick their smoking habit for good, she says. The study, ""A Randomized Trial of Text Messaging for Smoking Cessation in Pregnant Women,"" was published October 2 in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine. ### The research was supported by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, part of the National Institutes of Health.

"Cooling babies deprived of oxygen at birth (perinatal asphyxia) can reduce the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood, according to a new study published in the journal Epilepsia. The study has been led by Marianne Thoresen, Professor of Neonatal Neuroscience, from the Bristol Medical School: Translational Health Sciences at the University of Bristol. It is known that newborn babies who suffer perinatal asphyxia may develop permanent brain injury resulting in cerebral palsy or other conditions, like epilepsy. Until recently, 20 to 30 per cent of these patients would develop epilepsy and many need regular antiepileptic treatment. The patients' cognitive performance, life quality and life expectancy is also affected by having the condition. The research team has developed and delivered cooling treatment, known as therapeutic hypothermia, for newborns who suffer lack of oxygen during birth. For up to eight years, the researchers followed 165 infants who were born in the south west and who received cooling therapy at St Michael's Hospital, Bristol, part of University Hospitals Bristol NHS Foundation Trust. The study examined how many babies were diagnosed with epilepsy and how many are on regular antiepileptic drug treatment at two and four to eight years of age. The research found that babies, born after 2007, who received the cooling treatment, had much less epilepsy than before cooling treatment was introduced. At two years, seven per cent of the children had an epilepsy diagnosis, however, far fewer, only two per cent, were on regular antiepileptic drugs. The study showed that more children had epilepsy when they reached the age of four to eight years with seven per cent on regular medication. However, these are very low numbers needing antiepileptic treatment compared to before cooling treatment was introduced as standard of care. Before therapeutic hypothermia was introduced, poor outcome meaning death or moderate or severe disability was around 66 per cent (32 per cent death and 34 per cent surviving with disability). In this cohort born after 2007, the number of children with poor outcome is lower at 34 per cent (11 per cent death and 23 per cent survived with disability). Also, the severity of cerebral palsy is milder and seven out of ten are able to walk. Even if a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia is accounted for, cooling therapy has increased the number of healthy survivors and there are very few children with epilepsy needing drug treatment. Professor Marianne Thoresen said: ""Even if we account for a lesser severity of perinatal asphyxia, our research has shown that therapeutic hypothermia reduces the number of children who develop epilepsy later in childhood. Cooling treatment also reduces the number and severity of cerebral palsy and increases the number of patients who survive normally."" ### The research was funded by Sparks UK; University of Bristol's Alumni Foundation; The Laerdal Foundation for Acute Medicine, Norway; University of Oslo, and a private donation.

"Specialists at The Christie and The University of Manchester have made a breakthrough which could potentially improve detection and treatment of anal cancer, as well as have wider implications for other cancers. Anal cancer is a rare form of cancer, but cases have increased dramatically in recent years. Research is urgently needed to improve detection and treatment and to save lives. The findings of this project will play a crucial role in these efforts going forward. Funded by the Bowel Disease Research Foundation (BDRF) charity, the work has been published in the Lancet Oncology journal. The study worked with data on more than 10,000 patients, examining whether current methods of checking if anal cancer has spread to lymph nodes are giving experts an accurate picture of survival rates. The research team was led from Manchester, working hand in hand with centres in Leeds and Switzerland. Anal cancer that has spread to lymph nodes is linked to a worse prognosis and lower chance of survival. The project's findings however have uncovered a phenomenon suggesting rates of lymph node spread are being overestimated, potentially leading to overtreatment of patients with chemo radiotherapy. This can result in damaging side-effects, and doctors are particularly keen to avoid it in cases where it offers little benefit to the patient at potentially great cost. The results will be crucial to future large scale trials looking at optimum care for anal cancer patients. By identifying a unique phenomenon, these results will be taken into account by future work and ultimately could lead to better diagnosis of tumour stage and thus better treatment. Christie consultant and University of Manchester Professor of Cancer Studies and Surgery, Andrew Renehan, leads the Manchester Cancer Research Centre (MCRC) Anorectal Organ Preservation Research Group. He said: ""These high-profile results will play a vital part in improving patient care. Our research team has done a wonderful job highlighting an important and as yet unrecognised issue in the staging of cases of anal cancer. ""These findings will help us to better understand how anal cancer patients should be treated, ultimately improving survival rates and quality of life. It is crucial that we tackle what is becoming an increasingly common form of cancer through research studies like this. These findings could provide learnings for other cancers too."" Christie patient Jill De Nardo, who is 58 from Buxton, was diagnosed with anal cancer in 2010. She said: ""My first thought on diagnosis was that I wanted to survive, I gave little thought to long term or late effects of treatment. Fortunately my treatment has been successful and seven years on my own late effects are manageable but will only get worse. Many are not so fortunate and live daily with the discomfort and impact of side effects such as joint pain and continence issues."" Jill adds: ""Anal cancer is on the increase and those of us who have been through what at times was gruelling radiotherapy regimen, welcome this study and the impact it will have on the treatment plans of patients in the future."" ###",0,news_reviews_00183
"New research shows that resistance training protects the brain in persons with multiple sclerosis, which may delay the development of the disease In the past, multiple sclerosis patients were advised not to exercise for fear of exacerbating the illness. However, it is now known that physical training can relieve many of the symptoms, including the excessive fatigue and mobility impairments that are often seen. New research now shows that resistance training may protect the nervous system and thus slow the progression of the disease. This is the main finding of a study conducted by a research partnership between Aarhus University, Aarhus University Hospital, the University of Southern Denmark and the University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, that has just been published in Multiple Sclerosis Journal. The study shows that resistance training has a number of positive effects on the brain, which go beyond what can be achieved through effective disease specific medication. ""Over the past six years, we have been pursuing the idea that physical training has effects on more than just the symptoms, and this study provides the first indications that physical exercise may protect the nervous system against the disease,"" says one of the researchers behind the study, Associate Professor Ulrik Dalgas from the Department of Public Health at Aarhus University. ""For the past 15 years, we have known that physical exercise does not harm people with multiple sclerosis, but instead often has a positive impact on, for example, their ability to walk, their levels of fatigue, their muscle strength and their aerobic capacity, which has otherwise often deteriorated. But the fact that physical training also seems to have a protective effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis is new and important knowledge,"" says Ulrik Dalgas. In the study, the researchers followed 35 people with multiple sclerosis for six months. Half of the group engaged in resistance training twice a week, while the other half continued to live their lives normally without systematic training. Prior to and following the six-month period, the test subjects had their brains MR-scanned, and the researchers could see that there was a tendency for the brain to shrink less in those patients who undertook resistance training. ""Among persons with multiple sclerosis, the brain shrinks markedly faster than normal. Drugs can counter this development, but we saw a tendency that training further minimises brain shrinkage in patients already receiving medication. In addition, we saw that several smaller brain areas actually started to grow in response to training,"" says Ulrik Dalgas. The researchers behind the study are still unable to explain why training has a positive effect on the brain in people with multiple sclerosis. A bigger and more in-depth on-going study will help to clarify this, and may also lead to improved treatment options, says Ulrik Dalgas. However, he stresses that the aim is not to replace medication with physical training. ""Phasing out drugs in favour of training is not realistic. On the other hand, the study indicates that systematic physical training can be a far more important supplement during treatment than has so far been assumed. This aspect needs to be thoroughly explored,"" says Ulrik Dalgas. It is not yet clear whether all people with multiple sclerosis can benefit from this type of exercise, as it has not been sufficiently tested in the more severely affected patients. Therefore, Ulrik Dalgas is not recommending that all multiple sclerosis patients throw themselves into intensive physical training regimes without first seeking professional advice. ### Facts, Multiple sclerosis is an incurable disease of the central nervous system. There are about twice as many women as men with multiple sclerosis. Eighty per cent of people with multiple sclerosis live with the disease for more than 35 years. The disease is found in both aggressive and more benign forms. The cause of the illness is unknown, but both genetic and environmental factors play a role.",0,news_reviews_00189
"Researchers have identified two new biological markers of cystic fibrosis (CF), a genetic disease which affects children and young adults, leaving them with lifelong health complications including digestive problems and persistent lung infections. The findings, published in the journal ACS Central Science, shed new light on the underlying mechanisms of CF and could lead to improved prognosis and better therapies for a disease which is quite variable, affecting different children in different ways, say researchers. ""There are chemical signatures in sweat that tell us an infant has CF,"" says Philip Britz-McKibbin, lead author of the study and a professor in the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at McMaster University. ""We set out to discover whether there were chemical indicators detected in sweat that could complement the gold standard for CF diagnosis: the sweat chloride test."" The test is commonly used in universal newborn disease-screening programs and measures the concentrations of salt. Elevated sweat chloride confirms that an infant actually has CF. But there are some obstacles that complicate clinical decision-making, explains Britz-McKibbin, because sweat chloride can result in ambiguous diagnoses in some borderline cases and does not reveal how the disease might progress for individual patients. ""Sweat contains lots of information related to human health that researchers have not fully analyzed and we found some unexpected chemicals associated with CF,"" he says. Using a specialized technique developed at McMaster, scientists collected and analyzed sweat samples from infants in CF clinics at the McMaster Children's Hospital and the Hospital for Sick Children in Toronto. They identified several unknown chemicals beyond chloride that were consistently associated with babies who had CF, including two different drug and environmental compounds the infants secreted in sweat at much lower concentration levels. Testing for these biomarkers could be done in cases in which the chloride sweat test result is unclear, say researchers. The biomarkers also point to other underlying mechanisms that contribute to the progression of CF and could lead to better therapeutic interventions earlier in life. ""The easier it is to detect CF, the earlier it can be diagnosed, and the better people's chances are at living a longer, healthier life"", says Joanna Valsamis, Chief Healthcare, Research and Advocacy Officer at Cystic Fibrosis Canada. ""CF Canada invests heavily in research that aims to improve the lives of people living with CF, and findings such as those from Dr. Britz-McKibbin are crucial to our understanding of the disease."" In Canada, one in every 3,600 children are diagnosed with CF. But life expectancy rates have risen dramatically in recent decades with the median age of survival now over 50 years, due to better treatments to improve lung function, better nutrition and lung transplants. Further benefits are expected with the advent of newborn screening programs that have resulted in early detection. ### The research was funded in part by Cystic Fibrosis Canada. Since 1960, CF Canada has invested more than $244 million in leading CF research and care.",0,news_reviews_00192
"Attaching curcumin, a component of the common spice turmeric, to nanoparticles can be used to target and destroy treatment-resistant neuroblastoma tumor cells, according to a new study published in Nanoscale. The study, conducted in partnership by researchers at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida, demonstrates a potentially novel treatment for neuroblastoma, the most common cancer in infants. ""High-risk neuroblastoma can be resistant to traditional therapy, and survival can be poor. This research demonstrates a novel method of treating this tumor without the toxicity of aggressive therapy that can also have late effects on the patient's health,"" said Tamarah J. Westmoreland, MD, PhD, a pediatric surgeon at Nemours Children's Health System and senior author of the study. ""Unique approaches to target tumor cells with nanoparticle delivery systems hold promise for treatment of resistant tumors, such as the high risk neuroblastoma. We are hopeful that in the future, nanoparticles can be utilized to personalize care to patients and reduce the late effects of therapy."" Neuroblastomas are cancers that start in early nerve cells and commonly form in the tissue of the adrenal glands, near the kidneys. About 700 new cases of neuroblastoma are diagnosed each year in the United States and most cases appear in children younger than 5 years old. High-risk neuroblastoma is hard to cure and is more likely to become resistant to standard therapies or recur. These cancers are also associated with late effects after treatments have ended, including developmental delays, hearing loss, or other disabilities. Curcumin has been shown to have substantial anti-cancer ability, but its low solubility and poor stability have made its use in medicinal applications challenging. Researchers from Nemours and UCF found that nanoparticles can be used to deliver curcumin to tumor sites. ""This shows that nanoparticles can be an effective delivery vehicle for cancer drugs,"" said Professor Sudipta Seal, who directs of UCF's NanoScience Technology Center and Advanced Materials Processing Analysis Center, and is a collaborator on the study. ""More research is needed, but we are hopeful it could lead to more effective treatment of this devastating disease in the future."" In the study, researchers loaded Cerium oxide nanoparticles with curcumin and coated them with dextran to test in cell lines of a high-risk form of neuroblastoma, known as MYCN-amplified, as well as non-amplified neuroblastoma. This formulation induced substantial cell death in neuroblastoma cells while producing no or only minor toxicity in healthy cells. Overall, the nano-therapeutic treatments showed a more pronounced effect in MYCN-amplified cells, which are traditionally more resistant to drug therapies. Nanoscience research, which explores the unusual properties of materials at the nanoscale, has led to advancements in medicine, energy, information storage, computing and other fields. At no more than 100 nanometers, nanoparticles are exceedingly small. By comparison, a sheet of paper is about 75,000 nanometers thick. ### This study was conducted in a laboratory setting in Orlando, Fla., at Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida in cells from children with neuroblastoma, but researchers hope to begin to use these curcumin nanoparticles with micro RNA in animal models to direct the molecule to a tumor site. This research is an excellent example of the collaboration between Nemours Children's Hospital and the University of Central Florida. Funding of this work was supported by the Nemours Foundation along with the regional economic development initiative of the Florida High Tech Corridor.",0,news_reviews_00193
"BLOOMINGTON, Ind. -- The use of medication to treat attention deficient hyperactivity disorder is linked to significantly lower risk for substance use problems in adolescents and adults with ADHD, according to a study led by researchers at Indiana University. The risk of substance use problems during periods of medication use was 35 percent lower in men and 31 percent lower in women in the study. The results, based upon nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the United States, are reported in the American Journal of Psychiatry. ""This study contributes to growing evidence that ADHD medication is linked to lower risk for many types of harmful behavior, including substance abuse,"" said Patrick D. Quinn, a postdoctoral researcher in the IU Bloomington College of Arts and Sciences' Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences, who led the study. ""The results also highlight the importance of careful diagnosis and compliance with treatment."" As one of the largest analyses on the risks and benefits of ADHD medication, the study drew on anonymous health care data from 146 million people with employer-based health insurance in the United States from 2005 to 2014. Specifically, the researchers mined the data to identify people with ADHD whose records showed periods of ADHD medication use and periods without ADHD medication use -- as well as one or more visits to the emergency room due to drug or alcohol use. They then calculated the odds of the visits occurring during the person's use of ADHD medication versus the same person's non-use of ADHD medication. ""Many factors can influence who receives ADHD treatment, including socioeconomic factors, health care access, the strength of support networks and disorder severity,"" Quinn said. ""Although no single study of real-world treatment practices can definitively show whether medication use lowers risk, studying the same people at different points in their medical history helps us control for these factors and isolate the role of medication in their behavior."" Of the nearly 3 million people with ADHD in the study's database, about 57 percent experienced periods in which they were and were not prescribed medication to treat the disorder. About 2 percent experienced an emergency room visit due to substance abuse. The median age of the study's participants was 21 for men and 28 for women. The majority of the ADHD medicines used in the study were stimulants such as Adderall, an amphetamine, and Ritalin, or methylphenidate. A significantly smaller number used nonstimulant ADHD medication such as Strattera, or atomoxetine. ""While concerns about prescribing medications to treat ADHD that have the potential for abuse are understandable, this study provides further evidence that the use of these medications is not associated with increased risk of substance use problems in adolescence or adulthood,"" Quinn said. ""Rather, this and other recent studies find that the risk of such problems is lower during and after periods of use of these medications."" Quinn is a member of the lab of Brian M.

Another study from this group recently reported in JAMA Psychiatry found that the use of ADHD medication was associated with lower risk of motor vehicle accidents in men and women. D'Onofrio is also a co-author of several studies based on patient data from Sweden that found similarly lower risk for substance abuse and transport accidents in people with ADHD who used medication. The larger number of people in the two more recent studies -- as well as the use of U.S. patients in the new analyses -- strengthens this earlier evidence. ""Together, these studies provide accumulating evidence about the possible short- and long-term benefits of ADHD medications,"" D'Onofrio said. ""They also provide important information to medical providers who prescribe ADHD medication -- as well as to adults with the disorder and parents trying to make medical decisions for children. Overall, I think people should find these results reassuring."" ### Other authors on the study were Martin E. Rickert, a research scientist at IU; Kwan Hur, Robert D. Gibbons and Benjamin B.

"CINCINNATI--Following a concussion or mild traumatic brain injury (TBI), patients may suffer from light sensitivity or photophobia, making it challenging to return to normal activities. The sensitivity may also trigger or exacerbate headaches. While sunglasses can provide some relief from photophobia, wearing them all the time is not always a practical solution, nor is it pleasant for patients to live in a dark room for days at a time. A new study from the University of Cincinnati (UC), published online this week in the Journal of Athletic Training, assessed the use of colored lenses in post-concussion patients and found wearing certain color-tinted sunglasses may be a good alternative to dark sunglasses. ""While sunglasses can provide some relief, they are not very practical indoors or in low light environments,"" says Joe Clark, PhD, professor in the Department of Neurology and Rehabilitation Medicine at the UC College of Medicine and lead author of the study. ""What is needed is a light mitigation strategy that can be readily employed indoors, which can optimize relief in those who suffer from photophobia, or light sensitivity."" Clark and researchers at the College of Medicine assessed visual symptoms of 51 concussion patients and used frames with varying colored lenses to find out if certain hues provided relief from photophobia. ""We found that 85 percent of patients reporting photophobia had relief of the symptoms with one or more colors-- blue, green, red and purple--with no reported adverse events,"" Clark says. ""Sensitivity to light can be common and impact activities of daily life suggesting that light mitigation might improve quality of life in many of these patients. Photophobia is a common symptom for patients following traumatic brain injury. Our goal in this study was to provide medical staff like athletic trainers with a method and means to assess and subsequently provide relief to an athlete who may be experiencing symptoms of photophobia,"" Clark adds. The goal is to help the concussion patient feel better as the brain heals. ""We compare the colored glasses to being like a brace or cast but for the brain,"" he says. ""It is temporary but prevents further injury or pain."" At least 3.8 million people in the United States sustain a concussion or traumatic brain injury every year, many not for the first time. As with many other health conditions, the presentation of concussion symptoms can vary greatly--while some individuals exhibit very little to no change in functionality and may report no symptoms at all, others may report confusion, headache, decreased balance and vision disturbances including blurry vision, trouble focusing and sensitivity to light. Photophobia is so common that many neurosurgical intensive care units consider it standard operating procedure to keep lights dimmed in rooms containing TBI patients says Clark. In addition to trying colored-lens sunglasses, the article suggests other ways to mitigate photophobia including wearing a wide-brimmed hat when outdoors, adjusting digital screen and device settings to an appropriate hue and brightness or purchasing filters for screens. However, the researchers noted, they do not recommend wearing colored glasses while driving. Certain colors make seeing stop lights or emergency vehicle lights difficult. ""We believe that an athletic trainer, in consultation with team physicians, may find it useful to apply this photophobia assessment and recommend colored glasses to his or her athlete,"" Clark says. ""The use of the colored glasses in the high school, college or other setting can allow a person to engage in some medically approved activities, while minimizing the risk of symptom exacerbation. We believe the use of the colored glasses that provide photophobia mitigation has added benefits superior to dark sunglasses, especially for indoor lighting."" ### Additional researchers on the study include Jon Divine, MD, a professor in the Department of Orthopaedic Surgery at the UC College of Medicine and head team physician for University of Cincinnati Athletics.

"A comparison between less-expensive, over-the-counter hearing assistance devices and a conventional hearing aid found that some of these devices were associated with improvements in hearing similar to the hearing aid, according to a study published by JAMA. Presently, hearing aids can only be purchased in the United States through a licensed professional, with an average cost of $4,700 for two hearing aids (uncovered by Medicare). According to nationally representative estimates, less than 20 percent of adults with hearing loss report hearing aid use. Personal sound amplification products (PSAPs) are less-expensive, over-the-counter devices not specifically labeled for hearing loss treatment, but some are technologically comparable with hearing aids and may be appropriate for mild to moderate hearing loss. Nicholas S. Reed, Au.D., of the Johns Hopkins School of Medicine, Baltimore, and colleagues compared five of these devices (costs, approximately $350 to $30) with a conventional hearing aid (cost, $1,910) among 42 adults (average age, 72 years) with mild to moderate hearing loss. The researchers found that the change in accuracy in speech understanding from unaided to aided varied by device. Three of the PSAPs were associated with improvements in speech understanding that were similar to results obtained with the hearing aid; one demonstrated little improvement; and speech understanding was worse with one PSAP. ""Results lend support to current national initiatives from the National Academies, White House, and bipartisan legislation requesting that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration create a new regulatory classification for hearing devices meeting appropriate specifications to be available over the counter,"" the authors write. A limitation of the study was the modest number of participants. ### For more details and to read the full study, please visit the For The Media website.

"Amsterdam, July 3, 2017 - Doctors should consider radiosurgery earlier for patients with severe facial pain, according to a new study in the International Journal of Radiation Oncology*Biology*Physics (the ""Red Journal"") - the official journal of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO). In the research, radiosurgery helped improve the quality of life for patients with trigeminal neuralgia and reduced their depression, which is often exacerbated by the side effects of other treatments. The authors, from Cleveland Clinic in the US, say considering radiosurgery earlier on could make a big difference to patients' lives. Trigeminal neuralgia (TN) is a very painful nerve disorder that causes an electrical shock feeling in the face, usually in older people. Some things can trigger it, like chewing or even the wind blowing, but attacks can be random. On a scale of 1-10, patients often describe the pain as 15 - off the scale. TN is commonly treated with anti-epileptic medications. While this can reduce the pain, it makes patients drowsy and tired, and they report feeling drunk. This has an impact on their quality of life and frequently causes depression, as it stops them from driving, working or even just leaving the house. According to the new study, radiosurgery, which is normally a second line treatment to be used following the medication, helps improve quality of life and reduce depression in patients with TN. By considering it earlier as a treatment option, doctors could help improve the lives of patients with TN more quickly. ""We knew radiosurgery results in pain relief, but we didn't know if the patients actually felt better,"" said Dr. Samuel Chao, corresponding author of the study. ""I think people go and see their neurologist and get the pain under control with medication, but they don't realize how lousy this can make them feel. Using radiosurgery earlier on allows patients to get off the medications, improving their quality of life by allowing them to return to activities they used to do."" Radiosurgery is a method for physically treating the nerve using radiation - with stereotactic radiosurgery, doctors can focus 192 beams of radiation on a single point. It is non-invasive, so doesn't require the healing time of traditional surgery. Treatment takes less than an hour and requires no anesthetic. However, it is often overlooked or delayed as a treatment because there is a lack of capability and experience with the method. Research has shown that radiosurgery reduces pain for 80% of patients, but the broader impact on their lives remained unknown. In the new study, Dr. Chao, Dr. Kotecha and his colleagues prospectively collected data from 50 patients they treated with radiosurgery using two questionnaires: EuroQOL 5-Dimension and Patient Health Questionnaire 9. They asked questions about the patients' pain and facial numbness, their health and their ability to take care of themselves. The researchers analyzed patients' answers before treatment and at each follow-up appointment, and found that patients reported an improved quality of life and lower rates of depression after radiosurgery. Importantly, the benefit of treatment was strongly driven by improvements in pain and discomfort as well as self-care. ""Pain and the medication to stop the pain make it difficult for people with TN to go outside and live life,"" explained Dr. Chao. ""With radiosurgery, we can reduce pain, improve quality of life and decrease depression - people can go out and enjoy life without worrying they will have a random attack. Giving options empowers the patient to be more aware of themselves and manage their own condition."" The team plans to analyze the impact of other treatment options and carry out a cost-based analysis to establish the best treatment options for TN. ### Notes for editors The article is ""Stereotactic Radiosurgery for Trigeminal Neuralgia Improves Patient-Reported Quality-of-Life and Reduces Depression,"" by Rupesh Kotecha, Jacob A.

"MERIDEN, Conn., June 22, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Protein Sciences Corporation announced the publication of clinical trial results comparing Flublok® Quadrivalent – the quadrivalent version of Flublok® influenza vaccine – to a traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. The data published in the June 22nd issue of the New England Journal of Medicine showed that Flublok Quadrivalent provided significantly improved protection against laboratory confirmed influenza illness in older adults. The publication notes that approximately 9,000 people aged 50 and older were enrolled and randomized in an efficacy study designed to compare Flublok Quadrivalent to a traditional quadrivalent vaccine. People who were given Flublok Quadrivalent were over 40% less likely to develop culture-confirmed influenza. This data satisfies both pre-specified criteria for non-inferiority and superiority of Flublok over the traditional egg-based quadrivalent inactivated vaccine. Flublok Quadrivalent was approved by the FDA in October 2016 and will be available nationwide in prefilled syringes for the upcoming flu season. ""This study shows that Flublok® Quadrivalent, produced with modern recombinant technology can provide better protection against confirmed influenza-like illness among older adults than standard-dose quadrivalent influenza vaccine produced with traditional technology,"" said Lisa Dunkle MD, Chief Medical Officer of Protein Sciences. ""We demonstrated statistically significantly better protection by Flublok based on considerably fewer people contracting the flu after vaccination with Flublok Quadrivalent. Today, we announce that these peer-reviewed results have been published in the highly respected New England Journal of Medicine. Furthermore, physicians are eligible for up to 1 hour AMA PRA category 1 CME credit for reading the article. Clearly, Flublok represents a major step forward in combating influenza on a global scale."" Flublok is the only flu vaccine made without the use of eggs and therefore is not subject to the mutations that are sometimes introduced into the vaccine during the process of egg adaptation that can cause the traditional vaccines to be ineffective (see Skowronski et al. (2014) PLOS ONE 9(3), e92153). Flublok contains three times more active ingredients than traditional vaccines and produced significantly higher immune responses to the A strains of influenza (especially H3N2) in the Flublok Quadrivalent study. Furthermore, Flublok Quadrivalent is the first and only high antigen-content quadrivalent flu vaccine that with its high efficacy makes it ideal for older adults and those with a compromised immune system. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain influenza virus, antibiotics, formaldehyde, preservatives, egg protein, latex, gluten or gelatin unlike other flu vaccines. Flublok Quadrivalent is FDA approved for adults 18 and older. For more information about Flublok, please visit www.flublok.com. About Protein Sciences Protein Sciences is a world leader in vaccine development and protein production. Our mission is our inspiration: to save lives and improve health through the creation of innovative vaccines and biopharmaceuticals. About Flublok® Flublok, the world's first recombinant protein-based vaccine for the prevention of seasonal influenza disease, is approved for all adults over 18 years. FDA approved the quadrivalent formulation (""Flublok Quadrivalent"") in October 2016 that will be commercially available for everyone over 18 years for the 2017/18 influenza season. Flublok is the only flu vaccine made in a 100% egg-free system using modern cell culture technology, making it unnecessary to use an infectious influenza virus, antibiotics or harsh chemicals (e.g., formaldehyde) in manufacturing. Flublok is highly purified and does not contain any preservatives (e.g., thimerosal - a form of mercury), egg proteins, gelatin or latex. In addition, Flublok contains three times more antigen than traditional flu vaccines (3x45mcg hemagglutinin protein versus 3x15mcg hemagglutinin protein). In a 2014/15 post-marketing study of 9,000 adults 50 years and older, people who received Flublok were over 40% less likely to develop cell culture confirmed influenza than people who received a traditional flu vaccine. Flublok is an exact copy of the influenza virus coat protein and is not subject to the egg-adapted mutations associated with low vaccine effectiveness (see Skowronski et al.

"Newswise — TORONTO, June 20, 2017 – In a Canadian first, a medical team has implanted a wireless device inside a heart failure patient, permitting clinicians to monitor the patient's cardiovascular status – virtually and in real-time – and proactively adjust treatment to prevent costly, potentially unnecessary hospitalization. ""Heart failure is an epidemic that commonly leads to hospitalization,"" says Dr. Heather Ross, scientific lead at the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research and cardiologist, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, University Health Network. ""Hospitalization is often necessary when patients start to retain fluid, develop congestion and experience shortness of breath. This technology is a way to directly measure how much fluid is in a patient, allowing us to intervene before they develop symptoms of congestion, before they end up in hospital. This is a big game-changer."" Funded by the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research, the device called CardioMEMS™ HF System was successfully implanted by interventional cardiologists at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre in March 2017. The system features a small butterfly-like sensor that then sits inside the pulmonary artery of a heart failure patient. When the patient lies on an accompanying antenna-equipped pillow device, the sensor provides important data – including the patient's lung pressure readings to clinicians – via a secure website. ""Never before have we had the ability to obtain a patient's accurate lung pressure data while they are outside the hospital,"" said Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner, Peter Munk Cardiac Centre. ""Traditionally we've relied on a patient describing symptoms, and by then they may have already progressed to the point of hospitalization. With this device, we can see warning signs days in advance, and adjust treatment accordingly."" The most rapidly rising cardiovascular disease in Canada, heart failure affects close to one million Canadians, and an estimated 26 million people globally. In Canada, heart failure patients stay an average of almost 10 days for each hospital admission, accounting for 1.4 million hospital stays a year. These patients live an average of 2.1 years after diagnosis and cost the Canadian health-care system more than $3 billion annually. About one-quarter of these patients return to hospital within three months, while approximately 50 per cent return to hospital within six months. The CardioMEMS™ HF System is designed to monitor heart failure patients whose condition is serious but who are not so ill that the technology cannot improve their outcome. The first Canadian patient implanted with the heart monitor will be among 25 patients within the Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research at the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre to be fitted with the device over the next nine months. Produced by Abbott, the CardioMEMSÔ HF System is approved in the United States by the Food & Drug Administration (FDA) and is currently awaiting approval by Health Canada. - 30 - Video interview: Dr. Heather Ross, cardiologist, and Meredith Linghorne, nurse practitioner. ABOUT THE TED ROGERS CENTRE FOR HEART RESEARCH The Ted Rogers Centre for Heart Research aims to develop new diagnoses, treatments and tools to prevent and individually manage heart failure – Canada's fastest growing cardiac disease. Enabled by an unprecedented gift of $130 million from the Rogers family, the Centre was jointly conceived by its three partner organizations: the Hospital for Sick Children, University Health Network, and the University of Toronto. Together, they committed an additional $139 million toward the Centre – representing a $270 million investment in basic science, translational and clinical research, innovation, and education in regenerative medicine, genomics, and the clinical care of children and adults. It is addressing heart failure across the lifespan. www.tedrogersresearch.ca / @trogersresearch ABOUT THE PETER MUNK CARDIAC CENTRE The Peter Munk Cardiac Centre is the premier cardiac centre in Canada. Since it opened in 1997, the Centre has saved and improved the lives of cardiac and vascular patients from around the world. Each year, approximately 55,000 patients receive innovative and compassionate care from multidisciplinary teams in the Peter Munk Cardiac Centre, and the Centre trains more cardiologists, cardiovascular surgeons and vascular surgeons than any other hospital in Canada.

"The two syndromes differ, though, in their constellation of symptoms. For example, psoriatic arthritis manifests most often in the lower extremities and is associated with the autoimmune skin condition called psoriasis, in which raised red, scaly patches appear on the skin. Although psoriatic rashes most often precede the onset of the arthritic stage, the reverse can also be the case. Only about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better. Three of the 10 top-selling drugs in the United States in dollar sales — adalimumab, etanercept and infliximab — are biologics prescribed for psoriatic arthritis as well as for the more common rheumatoid arthritis. These three drugs share a common property: They block the action of a pro-inflammatory substance called tumor necrosis factor. Secreted by various immune cells, TNF stimulates the immune response and accompanying inflammation. However, despite the availability of TNF inhibitors, ""only about half of psoriatic arthritis patients who are given TNF inhibitors get better,"" said Genovese. Although the ultimate cause of the disease remains unknown, there was a good clinical rationale for hoping it might be responsive to ixekizumab. For the last decade or so, Genovese said, another pro-inflammatory substance called IL-17 has been drawing the attention of immunologists focusing on psoriasis and psoriatic arthritis. Ixekizumab works by blocking IL-17. The drug, an injectable monoclonal antibody, is already commercially available for the treatment of psoriasis, for which it has been remarkably effective, said Genovese. And in an earlier Lilly-sponsored phase-3 trial, ixekizumab was shown to be effective for psoriatic arthritis patients who had not yet been treated with biologic drugs such as TNF inhibitors. (Another approved monoclonal-antibody that targets IL-17, secukinumab, was approved in 2016 for psoriatic arthritis.) Less pain and swelling Over the 24-week duration of the latest trial, 109 participants received ixekizumab every two weeks; 94 received placebo injections every two weeks; and 111 alternated every two weeks between getting injections of ixekizumab and the placebo. While 19.5 percent of patients who received only the placebo injections were judged to have met the trial's specified clinical endpoint — at least a 20 percent reduction in the number of tender and swollen joints — the response rate among those getting the real drug every four weeks was 53.3 percent. Those getting the drug every two weeks didn't do any better and were slightly more prone to side effects, such as a mild reaction at the injection site. Although any treatment that works by blocking the immune system's ability to mount an inflammatory response should be carefully monitored for its potential to render the body vulnerable to infectious disease, there were few observed differences in this category between recipients of placebo versus active drug given every four weeks, Genovese said. Lilly has filed for approval of the drug by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. Genovese has served as a consultant to Lilly.

"CLEVELAND, Ohio (May 17, 2017)--Fennel, an anise-flavored herb used for cooking, has long been known for its health benefits for a variety of issues, including digestion and premenstrual symptoms. A new study confirms that it is also effective in the management of postmenopause symptoms such as hot flashes, sleeplessness, vaginal dryness, and anxiety, without serious side effects. The study outcomes are published online today in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS). The use of complementary and alternative medicine for the management of menopause symptoms has surged in recent years as women have attempted to identify alternatives to hormone therapy (HT). Although HT is the most effective treatment for managing most menopause symptoms, some women have turned to herbal medicine because they are either not candidates for HT or are concerned about the negative publicity surrounding potential side effects. Fennel, an herb containing essential oils, has phytoestrogenic properties. Phytoestrogens are estrogen-like chemicals in plants that have been used to effectively treat a wide array of menopause symptoms. In this small trial of 79 Iranian women aged 45 to 60 years, soft capsules containing 100 mg of fennel were administered twice daily for eight weeks. Improvements were compared between the intervention and placebo groups at four, eight, and 10 weeks, with a significant statistical difference documented. In the end, fennel was concluded to be a safe and effective treatment to reduce menopause symptoms without serious side effects. The study described in the article ""Effect of Foeniculum vulgare Mill. (fennel) on menopausal symptoms in postmenopausal women: a randomized, triple-blind, placebo-controlled trial"" is one of the first clinical studies to examine the benefits of fennel for managing menopause symptoms, even though it had been previously studied and confirmed to manage premenopause symptoms. The study was completed in Tehran, Iran, where the average age of women at menopause is younger than in the United States: 48.2 years versus 51 years, respectively. Some of the most common adverse effects of menopause are hot flashes, vaginal dryness, sleep problems, joint and muscular discomfort, exhaustion, irritability, anxiety, and depression. ""This small pilot study found that, on the basis of a menopause-rating scale, twice-daily consumption of fennel as a phytoestrogen improved menopause symptoms compared with an unusual minimal effect of placebo,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, executive director of NAMS. ""A larger, longer, randomized study is still needed to help determine its long-term benefits and side effect profile."" ###",0,news_reviews_00228
"Newswise — Patients with castration resistant prostate cancer (CRPC) usually have a poor prognosis. In part, this is due to the cancer's ability to resist anti-androgen therapy. A University of Colorado Cancer Center study published today [May 3] in Oncotarget shows that combining a CPT1A inhibitors with anti-androgen therapy increases the cancer's sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide. ""This is a huge development for men with CRPC that previously did not have many options,"" says Isabel Schlaepfer, PhD, CU Cancer Center member, assistant professor in the Division of Medical Oncology and senior author of the study. ""There is a critical need for improved therapies for this specific cancer type."" Most cells use the energy of glucose (sugar). Some prostate cancers evolve to use energy from lipids (fat). Previous work shows that metabolizing lipids helps prostate cancer escape anti-androgen therapy. However, there are many steps involved in lipid metabolism and researchers have been working to break prostate cancer's ability to harness this energy source. In this study the researchers focused on the CPT1A enzyme. CPT1A helps facilitate the entry of long chain fatty acids into the cell's mitochondria for oxidation. This oxidation is vital to lipid metabolism and has been shown to aid cancer cell survival, resistance to radiation, oxidative stress, and activation of oncogenic signaling pathways. ""We had to find a way to block this pathway so that the cancer would not be able to burn lipid in the mitochondria to acquire energy to resist therapy,"" explains Schlaepfer. In fact, we are already able to block the action of the CPT1A enzyme. The drug ranolazine is a fat oxidation inhibitor that earned FDA approval in 2006 to treat angina. When Schlaepfer and colleagues experimented with fat burning inhibitors and anti-androgens in cancer cell lines, they found that the addition of ranolazine to anti-androgen therapy made tumors more sensitivity to the anti-androgen drug enzalutamide. ""This finding may have a huge impact on patients with CRPC that had very few options before,"" says Schlaepfer. ""Since the drugs are clinically safe, a clinical trial can be designed in patients for whom enzalutamide is prescribed.""",1,news_reviews_00232
"EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE UNTIL 4 PM ET, April 19, 2017 150-year-old Drug May Provide ‘Off' Time Relief for People with Advanced Parkinson's Disease BOSTON - New research provides evidence that an old drug may provide relief for people with advanced Parkinson's, according to a study released today that will be presented at the American Academy of Neurology's 69th Annual Meeting in Boston, April 22 to 28, 2017. When it comes to the treatment of Parkinson's disease, the oral drug levodopa has long been considered the gold standard, improving quality of life and longevity. But as the disease progresses, the effects of the medication can partially wear off more quickly after each dose, leaving people to experience ""off"" time, which are periods of immobility related to temporary unresponsiveness to medication. Parkinson's symptoms, such as slowness and muscle rigidity, often make movement difficult. ""If a person with Parkinson's disease can reduce their ‘off' times, that can have a great impact on their everyday life,"" said study author Regina Katzenschlager, MD, of Danube Hospital, affiliated with the Medical University of Vienna, Austria. ""In some patients in the trial, the insecurity of unpredictable periods of incapacity was completely alleviated."" The drug apomorphine, first produced in 1865, was first used to treat advanced Parkinson's disease in the United States in 1950. Its use grew in the 1990s when European doctors starting using subcutaneous infusions of the drug to treat fluctuations in mobility that could not be controlled by the pills. Despite its use in many countries of the world, high-level evidence from randomized, blinded studies of its effectiveness and safety has up until now been lacking. In this phase III study, researchers recruited 107 people with advanced Parkinson's disease from 23 centers in seven countries. Participants were randomly selected to receive either apomorphine subcutaneous infusion or a placebo saline infusion. The infusion was administered over a period of 14 to 18 hours each day via a small portable pump similar to the sort used in the treatment of type 1 diabetes. The study found that those who were given apomorphine had a significantly greater reduction of ""off"" time than those who were given the placebo infusion, with, on average, 2.5 hours less ""off"" time per day, while those who received the placebo infusion had an average 30 minutes per day reduction in ""off"" time. This improvement was apparent within the first week of treatment. At the same time, for those who received apomorphine, there was an increase of ""on"" time without the abnormal involuntary movements known as dyskinesias that are often observed with levodopa. Participants were also asked to evaluate how well they thought the treatment worked. Those who received apomorphine gave their treatment higher scores at week 12 than those who received the placebo infusion. In the apomorphine group, 71 percent of patients felt improved, compared to 18 percent on placebo, whereas 19 percent worsened on apomorphine compared to 45 percent on placebo. Apomorphine was generally well tolerated and there were no serious side effects. ""It is our hope that these findings confirming the efficacy of apomorphine infusion will encourage doctors in the United States to offer this treatment to their patients and assess its efficacy in their own clinical practice,"" said Katzenschlager. The study was supported by Britannia Pharmaceuticals Ltd., the maker of apomorphine. Learn more about Parkinson's disease at www.aan.com/patients.

The long-term appearance after reduction is not optimized 50% of the time using standard reduction techniques,"" notes lead author Dr. Frank Lau. ""At LSU Health New Orleans, we offer an improved technique that preserves more of the critical breast anatomy. This study provides an anatomical foundation for why our technique may yield better, longer-lasting results."" About 50% of patients who undergo the most commonly used breast reduction technique experience pseudoptosis or ""bottoming out"" as a long-term complication. This occurs when breast tissue drops to the lower portion of the breast independent of nipple position. ""We want our patients to have a long-lasting, aesthetically pleasing breast shape,"" says Lau. Believing that disruption of the lower suspensory ligaments may be a critical factor because they are stronger than the upper sensory ligaments, the researchers conducted a retrospective review of 208 patients who underwent breast reduction surgery from 2008-2015, studying the results in 400 individual breasts. In all patients, only one reduction technique was performed per patient. Ninety-two percent of the 174 reductions performed with the inferior pedicle technique used a Wise pattern incision, which disrupts the lower suspensory ligaments, and 7.5% used a Boston modification of Robertson technique, which preserves the lower suspensory ligaments. Of the 33 superomedial pedicle reductions, 25 (75.8%) used a Wise pattern incision and 8 (24.2%) used a vertical pattern incision. By measuring the sternal notch-nipple distance and the nipple-inframammary fold distance ( proxies for upper and lower sensory ligament strength, respectively), the study found a differential rate of stretch - for every 1 cm in upper sensory ligament stretch, the lower sensory ligament length increases by 0.45 cm. This relationship strengthens the researchers' hypothesis that the lower pole ligaments stretch at a significantly slower rate than the upper pole ligaments. An anatomic basis for this differential may exist. A horizontal membrane of dense connective tissue originating at the level of the fifth rib that divides the breast into segments at the level of the nipple has been described. This division may signify a transition point in sensory ligament strength. On that basis, the authors recommend that techniques such as the Boston modification of Robertson technique should be preferred by surgeons seeking to avoid pseudoptosis. Other advantages of the Boston modification of Robertson technique include decreased operative time and elimination of the ""triple point,"" the most common site of postoperative incision rupture. ""This study is one of the largest breast anthropometry (measurement) studies ever performed,"" says Lau. ""These results help us provide the best breast reduction outcomes to our patients."" ### Co-authors include Thomas Steele, a 4th-year medical student at LSU Health New Orleans School of Medicine, and Julian Pribaz, MD, of Brigham and Women's Hospital, Harvard Medical School.",0,news_reviews_00249
"Newswise — The first laser treatments used to treat skin conditions such as benign vascular birthmarks and port-wine stains were developed more than 40 years ago. Since then, clinicians and dermatologists have seen a rise in demand for minimally invasive laser-based treatments, including tattoo removal. However, it is difficult for the laser light, which is held at a distance from the skin, to be perfectly and selectively absorbed by only the targeted birthmark or tattoo. Now, researchers from the University of Missouri have developed instruments that transmit laser light into the tissue through direct contact. The techniques developed by the interdisciplinary team can be used by dermatologists and will reduce safety concerns in laser dermatology by improving laser transmission through surface layers of the skin. Laser techniques come with risks, including eye damage. Open-air transmission, in which the clinician holds the laser at a distance from the patient, is typical during normal dermatological procedures and presents a hazard to both the patients' and doctors' eyes. Paul J.D. Whiteside, a doctoral candidate in the MU Division of Food Systems and Bioengineering, devised a system that will not only improve the process, but will be safer for both clinicians and patients. ""The system we developed uses ultrasonic pulsation in conjunction with a clinical laser to alter the properties of skin tissues during the procedure,"" Whiteside said. ""We've named the technique ‘sonoillumination,' and we're hopeful that the procedure will be available widely in the near future."" Whiteside and his team, including adviser, Heather K. Hunt, an assistant professor of bioengineering in the MU College of Engineering, tested the sonoillumination system on porcine skin tissue samples. Using various amplitudes and pulses, the instruments they developed were tested on the samples and showed great promise for the clinical setting. Whiteside presented his technique to clinicians on April 9, 2017, at the annual conference of American Society for Laser Medicine and Surgery (ASLMS). ""Pork skin samples are very close to human skin samples, so the initial results we saw are promising for human applications,"" Hunt said. ""‘Sonoillumination' will be extremely beneficial for clinicians and the ASLMS presentation allowed us to demonstrate the system to the people who actually will be using the technology once it's commercialized."" Nicholas Golda, associate professor of dermatology and director of dermatology surgery at the MU School of Medicine, echoed the merits of the sonoillumination system and the effect it will have on dermatology. ""Our goal is to provide patients with safer, more effective treatment options that potentially lower the number of treatments needed,"" Golda said. ""This new technology may also provide physicians with a safer, more controllable option for treating patients."" The team co-authored the paper, ""Ultrasonic modulation of tissue optical properties in ex vivo porcine skin to improve transmitted transdermal laser intensity,"" which recently was accepted for publication by the society's journal, Lasers in Surgery and Medicine. The sonoillumination research was funded in part by a 2015 Fast Track grant from the University of Missouri System. The team is in the planning stages of developing a start-up company to commercialize the technique. Products produced by Whiteside and the team highlight the University's impact on the state's economic development efforts, including commercialization of research conducted at Mizzou, workforce development and job growth, quality of life improvements for residents, and attracting corporations and businesses to the state. Over the last five years, companies commercializing MU technologies have secured hundreds of millions of dollars in investments and grants to advance their commercialization efforts. In 2016, the Office of Technology Management and Industry Relations reported that Mizzou received $14.9 million in revenue from more than 40 technology licenses. The MU bioengineering department is jointly affiliated with College of Agriculture, Food and Natural Resources (CAFNR) and the College of Engineering.

"For Immediate Release: March 28, 2017 Español The U.S. Food and Drug Administration today approved Dupixent (dupilumab) injection to treat adults with moderate-to-severe eczema (atopic dermatitis). Dupixent is intended for patients whose eczema is not controlled adequately by topical therapies, or those for whom topical therapies are not advisable. Dupixent can be used with or without topical corticosteroids. ""FDA's approval of Dupixent demonstrates our commitment to approving new and innovative therapies for patients with skin disease,"" said Julie Beitz, M.D., director of the Office of Drug Evaluation III in the FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. ""Eczema can cause significant skin irritation and discomfort for patients, so it is important to have a variety of treatment options available to patients, including those patients whose disease is not controlled by topical therapies."" Atopic dermatitis, a chronic inflammatory skin disease, is often referred to as ""eczema,"" which is a general term for several types of inflammation of the skin. Atopic dermatitis is the most common of the many types of eczema; onset typically begins in childhood and can last through adulthood. The cause of atopic dermatitis is a combination of genetic, immune and environmental factors. In atopic dermatitis, the skin develops red, scaly and crusted bumps, which are extremely itchy. Scratching leads to swelling, cracking, ""weeping"" clear fluid, and finally, coarsening and thickening of the skin. Dupixent is administered as an injection under the skin. Dupixent's active ingredient is an antibody (dupilumab) that binds to a protein [interleukin-4 (IL-4) receptor alpha subunit (IL-4R a )], that causes inflammation. By binding to this protein, Dupixent is able to inhibit the inflammatory response that plays a role in the development of atopic dermatitis. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent were established in three placebo-controlled clinical trials with a total of 2,119 adult participants with moderate-to-severe atopic dermatitis not adequately controlled by topical medication(s). Overall, participants who received Dupixent achieved greater response, defined as clear or almost clear skin, and experienced a reduction in itch after 16 weeks of treatment. Dupixent can cause side effects such as serious allergic reactions and eye problems, such as pink eye (conjunctivitis) and inflammation of the cornea (keratitis). If patients experience new or worsening eye symptoms such as redness, itching, pain or visual changes, they should consult a health care provider. The most common side effects include injection site reactions; cold sores in the mouth or on the lips; and eye and eyelid inflammation, including redness, swelling and itching. The safety and efficacy of Dupixent have not been established in the treatment of asthma. Patients who also have asthma should not adjust or stop their asthma treatment without talking to their physicians. The FDA granted the application for Dupixent Priority Review and Breakthrough Therapy designation. The FDA granted the approval of Dupixent to Regeneron Pharmaceuticals, Inc. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The Agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. ### Inquiries Media: Sarah Peddicord 301-796-2805 Consumer: 888-INFO-FDA Related Information",0,news_reviews_00256
"Newswise — Bethesda, Md. (March 23, 2017)—Statin drugs are widely used to manage high cholesterol and reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease. But in a new review of more than 50 studies, researchers cite reductions in liver inflammation and improvements in other related factors as reasons why statins make good candidates for treating chronic liver disease. The article is published ahead of print in the American Journal of Physiology—Gastrointestinal and Liver Physiology. Reducing cholesterol can have a positive effect on many chronic liver disorders, including non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, as well as in biliary disorders. In some studies, the research team found that statins reduced inflammatory molecules that are typically elevated with liver disease and improved inflammation in the endothelium (cells that line the blood vessels). Statin use may also lead to:• Decreased fibrosis (hardening or scarring of tissue),• Less development of fatty liver,• Slowed or halted spread of hepatitis C virus,• Improvement of portal hypertension (high blood pressure in the liver's blood vessels), • Destruction of existing liver tumor cells, and • Reduced risk of developing liver cancer. The researchers acknowledge that statin drugs can contribute to liver damage in some people, but for people with advanced liver disease, ""[s]tatins are cost-effective, generally well-tolerated by patients and the benefits of statin treatment in most patients outweigh their potential hepatotoxic risk.""

"AUGUSTA, Ga. (March 9, 2017) - The first year of free lung cancer screening in the Augusta, Georgia area found more than double the rate seen in a previous large, national study as well as a Massachusetts-based screening for this number one cancer killer. The higher rates, coupled with the majority of cases being found in early, treatable stages, point toward the need for ongoing, accessible free screening in high-risk populations and underserved regions, say researchers at the Georgia Cancer Center at Augusta University. High risk includes those who have smoked a pack of cigarettes daily for two or three decades and, if they've quit smoking, did so less than 15 years ago. The screening of 264 high-risk individuals within a 150-mile radius of Augusta found 3 percent had lung cancer and 75 percent of those were caught early, said Dr. Carsten Schroeder, thoracic oncology surgeon at the Georgia Cancer Center and Medical College of Georgia at AU. The researchers note that a percentage of the patients presenting at screening had early symptoms, like a persistent cough, so the rate of cancer detection in patients who showed no indication of disease was 2.2 percent, still double the rates of previous studies. ""Lung cancer is still the number one cancer killer in the United States and in our world,"" Schroeder said. ""If we catch it in the early stages, ideally before symptoms surface, we can operate and patients can have an overall survival rate of 90 percent."" Five-year survival rates are closer to 5 percent in more advanced disease. The pioneering National Lung Screening Trial, which began in 2002 and included 33 largely urban centers, found 292 cases of lung cancer among the 26,722 high-risk individuals screened in the first year, for a rate of 1.1 percent. That study also provided the first broad evidence that low-dose computed tomography, or LDCT, was a more effective screening tool than the traditional chest X-ray. A decade later, the Massachusetts-based Lahey Hospital & Medical Center, on which the Augusta screening was modeled, found a .6 percent prevalence in the first 10 months of screening. Like the previous experiences, the Augusta area screening that started in 2014, also reiterated the ability of LDCT to find lung cancer early, said Schroeder, corresponding author of the study in Southern Medical Journal. Six of the eight cases found in the screening were considered potentially curable with surgery. Positive results were communicated directly to the participant's primary care provider; negative results were communicated to primary care docs and participants, along with a reminder for another screening in a year. Participants, particularly from surrounding, more rural communities, have limited access to health care, Schroeder said. The area's median household income is 27 percent lower than the national average and the poverty level is 67 percent higher, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The Augusta-area experience found generally younger patients, who started smoking earlier in life and had multiple risk factors. Augusta area participants were an average of 60 years old, about half male and female, more than 68 percent were white and nearly 20 percent were black. ""It doesn't matter how old you are, if you have smoked 30 years, you might want to consider a lung-cancer screening,"" Schroeder said, referencing the reality that some adults started smoking as children. Part of his drive to start a screening program in the Augusta area was that, when he relocated here three years ago from the Cleveland area, he found patients were often referred to him with later, less-treatable disease. In the Cleveland area where Schroeder previously practiced as a faculty member at Case Western Reserve University and where access to health care and/or health insurance was more widely available, early lung cancers might even be detected incidentally when patients had CT scans for a variety of other reasons. Augusta researchers were able to offer free screening by utilizing natural downtime of the combined positive emission tomography, or PET, and computed tomography, or CT, scanner, said Dr. Norman B. Thomson III, chief of general/cardiothoracic radiology in the MCG Department of Radiology and Imaging and study co-author. The combination technology is often used to visualize other tumor types throughout the body and many patients require an injection of sugar dye, which will be taken up by the tumor but must first circulate for about an hour before the scan is done. That means the machine is staffed at times when it is not able to be fully used for other diagnostic procedures, time that provides a natural window for lung screening using just the CT imaging capability in under five minutes from arrival to exit, Thomson said. More typically, a scan could cost between $100-$250. In the last decade, CT technology has gotten increasingly adept at picking up early, small nodules, Thomson said. Low radiation doses work well in the lungs, which are mostly filled with air that provides a blank background for nodule surveillance. Thomson notes that means LDCT is also adept at finding things like scar tissue and small inflammatory nodules, that also are more common in the lungs of smokers. Nodules a third of an inch or smaller tend not to be cancer and more solid masses tend to be, Thomson said. They may follow up on smaller nodules in six months, then if the nodule is stable, go back to annual reviews. And while some lung cancers are super aggressive, screening also may uncover some slow-growing versions that - like some prostate cancers - will not threaten life but need to be treated and/or closely followed once found. ""That's why the acid test for screening is not how many cancers you find or what stage the cancer is,"" Thomson said, rather what screening does to lung cancer death rates. Current evidence definitely supports screening, he said. Also, like lung cancer has been coincidently found in CT scans for other reasons, physicians like Thomson and Schroeder are now incidentally finding cardiovascular disease in their lung cancer screening. To date about 700 individuals have been screened in the Augusta area and Schroeder is working to expand statewide, hoping to use the state public medical school's extensive campus network that has students learning from physicians at practices and hospitals across Georgia, as a natural base. ""We want to reach as many people as we can as early as we can,"" he said. Also, about half of patients screened continue to smoke so screening might also be a logical point for smoking intervention, Schroeder said. The original National Lung Screening Trial, orchestrated by the National Cancer Institute and the American College of Radiology, was launched in 2002 and enrolled nearly 54,000 patients nationally. Five-year survival rates were about 70 percent for early cancers and about 5 percent for lung cancer found late. Following the trial, the National Comprehensive Cancer Network, a nonprofit organization of cancer centers that develop guidelines for cancer diagnosis and treatment, along with the United States Preventive Services Task Force, which makes recommendations for preventive medicine, recommended screening high-risk individuals on a slightly broader scale, which the Lahey and Augusta area screening used. The group recommends screening for those age 55-80 with a 30-pack year or greater history who have stopped smoking for 15 years or less and those age 50 or older with a 20-pack year smoking history and an additional risk factor other than secondhand smoke, such as family history of lung cancer or a personal cancer history. A pack year means smoking one pack a day for 30 years, or a variation like two packs daily for 15 years. After 15 years of not smoking, the lung cancer risk tends to diminish but never vanishes. Schroeder would prefer the screening still not stop there. A total of 398 individuals signed up for the Augusta area screening, 350 qualified and 264 actually had LDCT. More than 80 patients were not screened in the first year, primarily because of socioeconomic and travel limitations that created a six-week backlog. Ninety percent of lung cancer is related to cigarette smoking, the leading cause of preventable disease and death in the United States, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Symptoms of lung cancer include persistent, intense coughing, shortness of breath, pain in the chest, shoulder or back and changes in the color and/or volume of phlegm or mucus, hoarseness and coughing up blood. A 2015 survey of smoking by adults by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention found about 15 percent of adults in the country smoked, rates for Georgia and adjacent South Carolina were between 16-20 percent. Rates in Massachusetts, where the Lahey screening occurred, are 12.8 to 16.4 percent. Rates were highest in certain demographics. As examples, smoking rates were highest among those without a graduate education degree certificate and lowest among those with a graduate degree; higher among those living below the poverty level versus above it; and higher among some minorities such as American Indians and Alaska Natives, multiple- race individuals and blacks. ### For more information about free lung cancer screening at the Georgia Cancer Center and MCG, call 706-721-4726 or email lung@augusta.edu.",0,news_reviews_00266
"A new study from Karolinska Institutet in Sweden shows that short-course preoperative radiotherapy combined with delayed surgery reduces the adverse side-effects of rectal cancer surgery without compromising its efficacy. The results are presented in the journal The Lancet Oncology. Rectal cancer affects some 2,000 men and women in Sweden every year. Preoperative radiotherapy was gradually introduced in the early 1990s, with a consequent improvement in prognosis for people with rectal cancer and reduction in the risk of local recurrence. ""Back then we showed that preoperative radiotherapy reduces the risk of local recurrence by over 50 per cent for patients with rectal cancer,"" says principal investigator Anna Martling, senior consultant surgeon and professor at Karolinska Institutet's Department of Molecular Medicine and Surgery. ""Thanks to our results, radiotherapy is recommended to many rectal cancer patients."" However, radiotherapy can cause adverse reactions and the optimal radiotherapeutic method and the interval between it and the ensuing surgery have been mooted. The study now presented in The Lancet Oncology is based on the claim that the adverse effects of rectal cancer treatment can be reduced by administering more but lower doses of radiation for a longer time, or by increasing the interval between radiotherapy and surgery. These hypotheses have now been tested in a study in which rectal cancer patients were randomly assigned to three different treatment arms: Standard therapy, i.e. short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy with direct surgery within a week. Delayed surgery with short-course (5x5 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks. Delayed surgery with long-course (25x2 Gy) radiotherapy followed by surgery after 4-8 weeks. The results of the study show that patients with delayed surgery develop fewer complications with equally good oncological outcomes. It also showed that there is no difference between long-course and short-course radiotherapy other than that the former considerably lengthens the time for treatment. ""The results of the study will give rise to improved therapeutic strategies, fewer complications with a sustained low incidence of local recurrence, and better survival rates for rectal cancer patients,"" says Professor Martling. ""The results can now be immediately put to clinical use to the considerable benefit of the patients."" ### Eighteen Swedish hospitals took part in the study, which was financed by the Swedish Research Council and the Cancer Society in Stockholm, and through the regional ALF agreement between Stockholm County Council and Karolinska Institutet. Researchers from the universities in Lund, Uppsala and Linköping also contributed to findings.

"THOUSAND OAKS, Calif., Feb. 2, 2017 /PRNewswire/ -- Amgen (NASDAQ:AMGN) today announced that the FOURIER trial evaluating whether Repatha® (evolocumab) reduces the risk of cardiovascular events in patients with clinically evident atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) met its primary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction (MI), non-fatal stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina or coronary revascularization) and the key secondary composite endpoint (cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI or non-fatal stroke). No new safety issues were observed. The EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial conducted in FOURIER patients also achieved its primary endpoint, demonstrating that Repatha was non-inferior to placebo for the effect on cognitive function. Detailed results from the Repatha FOURIER outcomes trial will be presented at the American College of Cardiology (ACC) 66th Annual Scientific Session Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session in Washington, D.C. on Friday, March 17 at 8 a.m. ET. Detailed results from the Repatha EBBINGHAUS cognitive function trial will be presented at the Late-Breaking Clinical Trials session on Saturday, March 18 at 8 a.m. ET. ""In the GLAGOV study, we demonstrated that Repatha has an effect on atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. These FOURIER results show unequivocally the connection between lowering LDL cholesterol with Repatha and cardiovascular risk reduction, even in a population already treated with optimized statin therapy,"" said Sean E. Harper, M.D., executive vice president of Research and Development at Amgen. ""Cardiovascular disease remains the number one health burden in the world, and we look forward to sharing these outcomes data with the scientific community at the ACC 66th Annual Scientific Session."" FOURIER ( F urther Cardiovascular OU tcomes R esearch with PCSK9 I nhibition in Subjects with E levated R isk) is a multinational Phase 3 double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial in approximately 27,500 patients who had either an MI, an ischemic stroke or symptomatic peripheral artery disease and an LDL ≥70 mg/dL or a non-HDL-C ≥100 mg/dL on optimized statin therapy. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. Patients were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly. The study continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary MACE (major adverse cardiac event) endpoint of cardiovascular death, MI or stroke, whichever occured first. EBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. Executive function (Spatial Working Memory strategy index – primary endpoint) and secondary endpoints of working memory, memory function, and psychomotor speed were assessed using a tablet-based tool (CANTAB) at baseline and select time points. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death worldwide.1 In the U.S., there are approximately 11 million people with ASCVD and/or familial hypercholesterolemia (FH) who have uncontrolled levels of low-density lipoprotein (LDL-C) over 70 mg/dL, despite treatment with statins or other cholesterol-lowering therapies.2,3 More than 60 percent of high-risk patients in Europe are still unable to adequately lower their LDL-C levels with statins or other currently approved lipid-lowering agents.4 Among very high-risk patients, the percentage is increased to more than 80 percent.4 It is estimated that less than one percent of people with FH (heterozygous and homozygous forms) in most countries are diagnosed.5 FOURIER Study Design FOURIER, a multinational Phase 3 randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, is designed to evaluate whether treatment with Repatha in combination with statin therapy compared to placebo plus statin therapy reduces cardiovascular events. The primary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction, stroke, hospitalization for unstable angina, or coronary revascularization. The key secondary endpoint is the time to cardiovascular death, myocardial infarction or stroke. Eligible patients with high cholesterol (LDL-C ≥70 mg/dL or non-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol [non-HDL-C] ≥100 mg/dL) and clinically evident ASCVD at more than 1,300 study locations around the world were randomized to receive Repatha subcutaneous 140 mg every two weeks or 420 mg monthly plus effective statin dose; or placebo subcutaneous every two weeks or monthly plus effective statin dose. Optimized statin therapy was defined as at least atorvastatin 20 mg or equivalent daily with a recommendation for at least atorvastatin 40 mg or equivalent daily where approved. The study was event driven and continued until at least 1,630 patients experienced a key secondary endpoint. EBBINGHAUS Study Design EBBINGHAUS ( E valuating PCSK9 B inding anti B ody I nfluence o N co G nitive H e A lth in high cardiovasc U lar risk S ubjects) is a double-blind, placebo-controlled randomized non-inferiority trial involving approximately 1,900 patients enrolled in the FOURIER outcomes study. The primary endpoint in the study is the Spatial Working Memory strategy index of executive function. Secondary endpoints are working memory, as assessed by the CANTAB Spatial Working Memory (SWM) test between-errors score; memory function, as assessed by the CANTAB Paired Associates Learning (PAL) test; and psychomotor speed, as assessed by the CANTAB Reaction Time (RTI) test. About Repatha® (evolocumab) Repatha® (evolocumab) is a human monoclonal antibody that inhibits proprotein convertase subtilisin/kexin type 9 (PCSK9). Repatha binds to PCSK9 and inhibits circulating PCSK9 from binding to the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) receptor (LDLR), preventing PCSK9-mediated LDLR degradation and permitting LDLR to recycle back to the liver cell surface. By inhibiting the binding of PCSK9 to LDLR, Repatha increases the number of LDLRs available to clear LDL from the blood, thereby lowering LDL-C levels.6 Repatha is approved in more than 40 countries, including the U.S., Japan, Canada and in all 28 countries that are members of the European Union. Applications in other countries are pending. Important U.S. Product Information Repatha® is indicated as an adjunct to diet and: Maximally tolerated statin therapy for treatment of adults with heterozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HeFH) or clinical atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD), who require additional lowering of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) Other LDL-lowering therapies (e.g., statins, ezetimibe, LDL apheresis) in patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia (HoFH) who require additional lowering of LDL-C The effect of Repatha® on cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has not been determined. The safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with HoFH who are younger than 13 years old. The safety and effectiveness of Repatha® have not been established in pediatric patients with primary hyperlipidemia or HeFH. Important U.S. Safety Information Contraindication: Repatha® is contraindicated in patients with a history of a serious hypersensitivity reaction to Repatha®. Allergic reactions: Hypersensitivity reactions (e.g. rash, urticaria) have been reported in patients treated with Repatha®, including some that led to discontinuation of therapy. If signs or symptoms of serious allergic reactions occur, discontinue treatment with Repatha®, treat according to the standard of care, and monitor until signs and symptoms resolve. Adverse reactions: The most common adverse reactions (>5% of Repatha®-treated patients and more common than placebo) were: nasopharyngitis, upper respiratory tract infection, influenza, back pain, and injection site reactions. In a 52-week trial, adverse reactions led to discontinuation of treatment in 2.2% of Repatha®-treated patients and 1% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reaction that led to Repatha® treatment discontinuation and occurred at a rate greater than placebo was myalgia (0.3% versus 0% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively). Adverse reactions from a pool of the 52-week trial and seven 12-week trials: Local injection site reactions occurred in 3.2% and 3.0% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common injection site reactions were erythema, pain, and bruising. The proportions of patients who discontinued treatment due to local injection site reactions in Repatha® -treated patients and placebo-treated patients were 0.1% and 0%, respectively. Allergic reactions occurred in 5.1% and 4.7% of Repatha® -treated and placebo-treated patients, respectively. The most common allergic reactions were rash (1.0% versus 0.5% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), eczema (0.4% versus 0.2%), erythema (0.4% versus 0.2%), and urticaria (0.4% versus 0.1%). Neurocognitive events were reported in less than or equal to 0.2% in Repatha®-treated and placebo-treated patients. In a pool of placebo- and active-controlled trials, as well as open-label extension studies that followed them, a total of 1,988 patients treated with Repatha® had at least one LDL-C value <25 mg/dL. Changes to background lipid-altering therapy were not made in response to low LDL-C values, and Repatha® dosing was not modified or interrupted on this basis. Although adverse consequences of very low LDL-C were not identified in these trials, the long-term effects of very low levels of LDL-C induced by Repatha® are unknown. Musculoskeletal adverse reactions were reported in 14.3% of Repatha® -treated patients and 12.8% of placebo-treated patients. The most common adverse reactions that occurred at a rate greater than placebo were back pain (3.2% versus 2.9% for Repatha® and placebo, respectively), arthralgia (2.3% versus 2.2%), and myalgia (2.0% versus 1.8%). Homozygous Familial Hypercholesterolemia (HoFH): In 49 patients with homozygous familial hypercholesterolemia studied in a 12-week, double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial, 33 patients received 420 mg of Repatha® subcutaneously once monthly.

"For women who suffer multiple pregnancy losses in the first four to six weeks of gestation, the hormone progesterone could offer hope for a successful birth, according to a new study by Yale School of Medicine researchers and their colleagues at University of Illinois at Chicago. The results are published in the current issue of Fertility & Sterility, the international journal of the American Society for Reproductive Medicine. Fetal death, or intrauterine fetal demise (IUFD), affects 30,000 women each year in the United States. About 25% of all women who become pregnant have a first-trimester loss. But for some women, every pregnancy results in a loss. The researchers studied the effects of micronized plant-derived progesterone in 116 of these women who had experienced two or more pregnancy losses. To determine whether a woman's endometrium (uterine lining) is healthy and can sustain the embryo, the research team used the endometrial function test (EFT®), which was created by study co-author Harvey J. Kliman, M.D., director of the Reproductive and Placental Research Unit in the Department of Obstetrics, Gynecology and Reproductive Sciences at Yale School of Medicine. An abnormal EFT is associated with pregnancy failure, while a normal EFT is associated with pregnancy success. Kliman and the team focused on the nCyclinE molecular marker as a way to assess patients with recurrent pregnancy loss. Women in the study with an abnormal nCyclinE level were prescribed progesterone two days after ovulation, when the uterine lining matures in preparation for a possible pregnancy. The researchers believe that the progesterone caused the patients' endometrium to produce more endometrial secretions. ""The endometrium feeds the baby up until the eighth week of pregnancy. Then at 9 to 10 weeks the mother's blood takes over to feed the embryo,"" said Kliman. ""In this subset of women experiencing multiple early miscarriages, we assume that their embryos were literally starving to death,"" Kliman added. ""They attached, but they were not getting enough food. When we give progesterone back to these women, the endometrium makes more nutrients and prevents their pregnancy loss. Kliman said he initially created the Endometrial Function Test (EFT®), which uses the nCyclinE marker, to identify women with infertility. ""This study has shown that the EFT can also be an important tool for patients with recurrent pregnancy loss,"" he said. Kliman worked with lead author Mary Stephenson, M.D., the Dr. Theresa S. Falcon-Cullinan Professor of Obstetrics and Gynecology at the University of Illinois at Chicago and director of the University of Illinois Recurrent Pregnancy Loss Program. ""We are very pleased to find that these results reinforce the evidence that progesterone could be a very beneficial, inexpensive, and safe treatment for many women with a history of recurrent pregnancy loss,"" said Stephenson. ""The positive results show us that next we need to study progesterone as a treatment for recurrent pregnancy loss with a prospective randomized trial to validate the findings."" ### Other authors on the study included Dana McQueen, M.D., and Michelle Wintes, M.D. Citation: Fertility & Sterility doi:10.1016/j.fertnstert.2016.11.029",1,news_reviews_00298
"CHICAGO --- Soon you can seek mental health advice on your smartphone as quickly as finding a good restaurant. A novel suite of 13 speedy mini-apps called IntelliCare resulted in participants reporting significantly less depression and anxiety by using the apps on their smartphones up to four times a day, reports a new Northwestern Medicine study. The apps offer exercises to de-stress, reduce self-criticism and worrying, methods to help your life feel more meaningful, mantras to highlight your strengths, strategies for a good night's sleep and more. Most apps designed for mental health typically offer a single strategy to feel better or provide too many features that make them difficult to navigate. Users may get bored or overwhelmed and may stop using the apps after a few weeks. But participants robustly used the IntelliCare interactive apps as many as four times daily -- or an average of 195 times -- for eight weeks of the study. They spent an average of one minute using each app, with longer times for apps with relaxation videos. The 96 participants who completed the research study reported that they experienced about a 50 percent decrease in the severity of depressive and anxiety symptoms. The short-term study-related reductions are comparable to results expected in clinical practice using psychotherapy or with that seen using antidepressant medication. The study will be published Jan. 5 in the Journal of Medical Internet Research. ""We designed these apps so they fit easily into people's lives and could be used as simply as apps to find a restaurant or directions,"" said lead study author David Mohr, professor of preventive medicine and director of the Center for Behavioral Intervention Technologies at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine. ""Some of the participants kept using them after the study because they felt that the apps helped them feel better,"" Mohr said. ""There were many apps to try during the study, so there was a sense of novelty."" Participants had access to the 13 IntelliCare apps from Google Play and received eight weeks of coaching for the use of IntelliCare. Coaching included an initial phone call plus two or more text messages per week over the eight weeks. In the study, 105 participants were enrolled and 96 of them completed the study. The preliminary study did not include a control arm, so it's possible that some people who enrolled in the trial would have improved anyway, partly because they may have been motivated to try something new, Mohr said. He now has launched a larger trial, recruiting 300 participants, with a control arm. Some of the IntelliCare apps include: Daily Feats: designed to motivate you to add worthwhile and rewarding activities into your day to increase your overall satisfaction in life. Purple Chill: designed to help you unwind with audio recordings that guide you through exercises to de-stress and worry less. Slumber Time: designed to ease you into a good night's rest. My Mantra: designed to help you create motivating mantras to highlight your strengths and values. ""Using digital tools for mental health is emerging as an important part of our future,"" Mohr said. ""These are designed to help the millions of people who want support but can't get to a therapist's office."" More than 20 percent of Americans have significant symptoms of depression or anxiety each year, but only around 20 percent of people with a mental health problem get adequate treatment. The IntelliCare algorithm recommends new apps each week to keep the experience fresh, provide new opportunities for learning skills and avoid user boredom. Although the apps are not validated, each one was designed by Northwestern clinicians and based on validated techniques used by therapists. IntelliCare is a national research study. Individuals can download the apps free with no financial obligation. But Northwestern researchers hope participants will provide confidential feedback, via four weekly questions, that will be used to further develop the system. The data will help the system make even better recommendations and provide more personalized treatment. People also may enroll in a study in which they will be paid to provide even more feedback. Some also will have access to an IntelliCare coach via text messaging and phone calls, who are available to support them in using the apps. ""We now have evidence these approaches will likely work,"" Mohr said. ""They are designed to teach many of the same skills therapists teach patients. Different apps are expected to work for different people. The goal is to find what's right for you."" ### Other Northwestern authors include Kate Tomasino, Emily Lattie, Hannah Palac, Mary J Kwasny, Kenneth Weingardt, Leland R Bardsley, Lauren Caccamo, Colleen Stiles-Shields and Stephen Schueller. Rebecca Rossom, a researcher with HealthPartners Institute, also was a study co-author.

"Newswise — Human papillomavirus-positive oropharynx cancers (cancers of the tonsils and back of the throat) are on rise. After radiation treatment, patients often experience severe, lifelong swallowing, eating, and nutritional issues. However, new clinical trial research shows reducing radiation for some patients with HPV-associated oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinomas can maintain high cure rates while sparing some of these late toxicities. ""We found there are some patients have very high cure rates with reduced doses of radiation,"" said Barbara Burtness, MD, Professor of Medicine (Medical Oncology), Yale Cancer Center, Disease Research Team Leader for the Head and Neck Cancers Program at Smilow Cancer Hospital, and the chair of the ECOG-ACRIN head and neck committee. ""Radiation dose reduction resulted in significantly improved swallowing and nutritional status,"" she said. The study, published in the December 26 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, showed that patients treated with reduced radiation had less difficulty swallowing solids (40 percent versus 89 percent of patients treated with standard doses of radiation) or impaired nutrition (10 percent versus 44 percent of patients treated with regular doses of radiation). ""Today, many younger patients are presenting with HPV-associated squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx,"" said Dr. Burtness. ""And while traditional chemoradiation has demonstrated good tumor control and survival rates for patients, too often they encounter unpleasant outcomes that can include difficulty swallowing solid foods, impaired nutrition, aspiration and feeding tube dependence,"" said Dr. Burtness. ""Younger patients may have to deal with these side effects for decades after cancer treatment. We want to help improve our patients' quality of life."" The study included 80 patients from 16 ECOG-ACRIN Cancer Research Group sites who had stage three or four HPV-positive squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, and were candidates for surgery. Eligible patients received three courses of induction chemotherapy with the drugs cisplatin, paclitaxel, and cetuximab. Patients with good clinical response then received reduced radiation. Study results also showed that patients who had a history of smoking less than 10 packs of cigarettes a year had a very high disease control compared with heavy smokers.

"SEATTLE - Dec. 5, 2016 - Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center announced promising results from an early trial in which patients with high-risk acute myeloid leukemia received genetically engineered immune cells. Of the 12 AML patients who received this experimental T-cell therapy after a transplant put their disease in remission, all are still in remission after a median follow-up of more than two years. Giving these cells when disease is in remission after transplant ""might actually be helping patients who have a high risk of relapsing to not relapse down the line,"" said Dr. Aude Chapuis, cancer physician and immunotherapy researcher at Fred Hutch, one of the study's leaders. Chapuis presented these results at the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Hematology in San Diego, California. The findings in this group of trial participants contrast with the outcomes the researchers observed in a cohort of similar patients who received transplants around the same time but did not receive engineered T cells. In all of these transplant-only patients, the transplants produced remissions, but more than a quarter of them relapsed within just 10 months. In the experimental T-cell therapy tested in this trial, certain T cells from each patient's transplant donor were genetically engineered to produce receptors that allowed the T cells to recognize, very specifically, a target molecule called WT1. WT1 is 10 to 1,000 times more common in leukemia cells than their noncancerous cousins, making it a natural target for therapies designed to destroy cancer cells while leaving most healthy cells alone. This is the team's first trial of this strategy, which was initially developed in the lab of Dr. Phil Greenberg, one of the study's leaders and the head of Fred Hutch's Program in Immunology. Because it was the first study of this particular approach, the researchers focused on a high-risk group -- AML patients undergoing bone marrow transplant who had certain genetic or disease characteristics that decrease the chance of long-term transplant success -- ""a hard population of patients,"" Chapuis said, many of whom ""were horribly sick."" Each patient's therapy was created just for them in a specialized Fred Hutch facility. Certain T cells from each patient's matched donor were given the genetic instructions to make a receptor that specifically reacts to WT1. Then came a blood stem cell transplant: Patients' leukemic bone marrow and blood cells were destroyed and replaced with healthy cells from their donors. A month later, when the team examined these 12 patients' marrow, they found no trace of the cancers. Rapidly thereafter, once the transplanted cells fully engrafted, each patient then received up to 10 billion of the genetically engineered donor cells, infused into their arm through an IV. Chapuis's role in this trial is on the laboratory side of the research, ensuring the quality of the genetically engineered cell products and monitoring the activity of the cells after infusion. She co-leads this research with Greenberg and Dr. Dan Egan of Fred Hutch, the trial's principal investigator and the care provider for trial participants. The study was supported by funding from the National Institutes of Health and spinoff Juno Therapeutics, of which Greenberg is a scientific co-founder. Outside of this trial, Chapuis treats cancer patients at Fred Hutch's clinical care partner, Seattle Cancer Care Alliance. Watching her patients undergo bone marrow transplant ? itself the first clear and reproducible example of cancer immunotherapy, developed at Fred Hutch ? has made her want to work toward something better. ""That's my source of inspiration. I'm always horrified by the intense treatment that we inflict on bone marrow transplant patients and the hardship that we make them go through. And I really think we can do better,"" Chapuis said. ""That's why I'm doing this."" ### At Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, home to three Nobel laureates, interdisciplinary teams of world-renowned scientists seek new and innovative ways to prevent, diagnose and treat cancer, HIV/AIDS and other life-threatening diseases. Fred Hutch's pioneering work in bone marrow transplantation led to the development of immunotherapy, which harnesses the power of the immune system to treat cancer with minimal side effects. An independent, nonprofit research institute based in Seattle, Fred Hutch houses the nation's first and largest cancer prevention research program, as well as the clinical coordinating center of the Women's Health Initiative and the international headquarters of the HIV Vaccine Trials Network. Private contributions are essential for enabling Fred Hutch scientists to explore novel research opportunities that lead to important medical breakthroughs.

Published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology online Dec.1, the study showed that one-time treatment with the hallucinogenic drug psilocybin — whose use required federal waivers because it is a banned substance — quickly brought relief from distress that then lasted for more than six months in 80 percent of the 29 study subjects monitored, based on clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression. The NYU Langone-led study was published side by side with a similar study from Johns Hopkins. Study results were also endorsed in 11 accompanying editorials from leading experts in psychiatry, addiction, and palliative care. ""Our results represent the strongest evidence to date of a clinical benefit from psilocybin therapy, with the potential to transform care for patients with cancer-related psychological distress,"" says study lead investigator Stephen Ross, MD, director of substance abuse services in the Department of Psychiatry at NYU Langone. ""If larger clinical trials prove successful, then we could ultimately have available a safe, effective, and inexpensive medication — dispensed under strict control — to alleviate the distress that increases suicide rates among cancer patients,"" says Ross, also an associate professor of psychiatry at NYU School of Medicine. Study co-investigator Jeffrey Guss, MD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, notes that psilocybin has been studied for decades and has an established safety profile. Study participants, he says, experienced no serious negative effects, such as hospitalization or more serious mental health conditions. Although the neurological benefits of psilocybin are not completely understood, it has been proven to activate parts of the brain also impacted by the signaling chemical serotonin, which is known to control mood and anxiety. Serotonin imbalances have also been linked to depression. For the study, half of the participants were randomly assigned to receive a 0.3 milligrams per kilogram dose of psilocybin while the rest received a vitamin placebo (250 milligrams of niacin) known to produce a ""rush"" that mimics a hallucinogenic drug experience. Approximately half way through the study's monitoring period (after seven weeks), all participants switched treatments. Those who initially received psilocybin took a single dose of placebo, and those who first took niacin, then received psilocybin. Neither patients nor researchers knew who had first received psilocybin or placebo. Guss says, ""The randomization, placebo control, and double-blind procedures maximized the validity of the study results."" One of the key findings was that improvements in clinical evaluation scores for anxiety and depression lasted for the remainder of the study's extended monitoring period — specifically, eight months for those who took psilocybin first. All patients in the study — mostly women age 22 to 75 who are or were patients at the Perlmutter Cancer Center of NYU Langone — had either advanced breast, gastrointestinal, or blood cancers and had been diagnosed as suffering from serious psychological distress related to their disease. All patients, who volunteered to be part of the study, were provided with tailored counseling from a psychiatrist, psychologist, nurse or social worker, and were monitored for side effects and improvements in their mental state. Co-investigator Anthony Bossis, PhD, a clinical assistant professor of psychiatry at NYU Langone, says patients also reported post-psilocybin improvements in their quality of life: going out more, greater energy, getting along better with family members, and doing well at work. Several also reported variations of spirituality, unusual peacefulness, and increased feelings of altruism. ""Our study showed that psilocybin facilitated experiences that drove reductions in psychological distress,"" says Bossis. ""And if it's true for cancer care, then it could apply to other stressful medical conditions."" Bossis cautions that patients should not consume psilocybin on their own or without supervision by a physician and a trained counselor. He also says ""Psilocybin therapy may not work for everyone, and some groups, such as people with schizophrenia, as well as adolescents, should not be treated with it."" Both the NYU Langone and Johns Hopkins studies were principally funded by the Heffter Research Institute, a non-profit, scientific institution with the principal mission of helping to design, review and fund studies on the use of psilocybin for a wide range of ailments (Ross previously served as a board member). Additional funding for the NYU Langone study was provided by the National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences, part of the National Institutes of Health (UL1 TR000038). The drug used in the study was manufactured by Organix Inc. in Woburn, Mass.

"CLEVELAND, Ohio (November 28, 2016)--It's somewhat of a little-known adverse effect of having breast cancer, but studies suggest that approximately 30% to 40% of women with breast cancer report persistent hot flashes. Nocturnal hot flashes are among the most problematic because they can contribute to poor sleep. A new study shows that electro-acupuncture may be effective in providing some relief. The study is being published online in Menopause, the journal of The North American Menopause Society (NAMS). Compared with women who undergo natural menopause, women with breast cancer are at a greater risk of experiencing hot flashes, partially as a result of the premature menopause that results from chemotherapy and surgery, as well as estrogen deficiency caused by the use of breast cancer treatments such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors. It is estimated that by the year 2020 there will be nearly six million breast cancer survivors in the United States. Researchers analyzed data from a randomized, controlled trial involving 58 breast cancer survivors experiencing bothersome hot flashes. They compared the benefits of using electro-acupuncture (the application of a pulsating electric current) to prescribing gabapentin, an anti-seizure medication frequently prescribed to treat sleep disturbances related to hot flashes. The study showed electro-acupuncture to be comparable to, if not better than, gabapentin in helping to reduce hot flash severity and frequency and improving overall sleep quality (including falling asleep faster and fewer sleep disruptions). Although it is not exactly understood how acupuncture affects sleep, it has been shown to affect a number of neurotransmitters associated with sleep, such as serotonin and melatonin. Poor sleep is particularly bothersome for breast cancer survivors experiencing nighttime hot flashes because it has been shown to increase levels of pain, fatigue, depression and anxiety. Although electro-acupuncture produced significant sleep improvements, researchers noted that sleep quality for the participants was still not as good as it should be, implying that more research is necessary to explore possible combinations of pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic treatments. ""This study shows that, for women who need or choose to avoid medications, electro-acupuncture may be an option because it has minimal risks, but blinded controlled trials are needed,"" says Dr. JoAnn Pinkerton, NAMS executive director. ### Funding for the study was provided in part by a grant from the National Institutes of Health/National Cancer Institute Cancer Center.",1,news_reviews_00325
"A study coordinated by the MUSC Health Weight Management Center shows the scales tipping in Weight Watchers' favor instead of standard care when it comes to helping people with Type 2 diabetes. Patrick O'Neil, Ph.D., directs the Weight Management Center and led the 16-site study. Results were published November 2 in the Obesity Journal. While the Weight Management Center has a high success rate at helping patients lose weight to fight diabetes, many people with the condition don't live near a specialized program and need help that's readily available. O'Neil said because Weight Watchers has centers all over the country, including sites in small towns with limited or no medical facilities, its program could help meet this need if combined with diabetes-specific counseling. That's why he said it was important for MUSC to be involved in the study, which was funded by a grant from the commercial weight loss program, Weight Watchers. Promoting healthy communities is part of MUSC's mission. The multi-site study's results were statistically and clinically significant, O'Neil said. ""The Weight Watchers people were significantly better off than people who received standard care."" They achieved better control of their blood sugar and lost more weight, he said. They still had diabetes, but many were able to reduce the amount of medication they were taking. The study's 563 participants were all overweight or obese and under a doctor's care for uncontrolled Type 2 diabetes. Half got standard care: a session of nutrition counseling with a registered dietitian and written materials. The other half went to Weight Watchers meetings, had access to Weight Watchers' online materials and had two phone consultations and follow-up email contact with certified diabetes educators who told them how to modify the Weight Watchers plan to help with their diabetes. Participants had four follow-up visits related to the study and continued to see their regular doctors for medical management of their diabetes. After a year, people in the Weight Watchers group had an average weight loss of about 4 percent of their starting weight, compared to 2 percent for the standard care group. The Weight Watchers group also had a bigger improvement in a measure of long-term control of their blood sugar, which can reduce the risk for serious problems related to Type 2 diabetes. Left uncontrolled, the condition can damage blood vessels and nerves, putting people at risk of having a heart attack or stroke. It can also cause eye problems, kidney damage and even lead to amputations. Risk factors for Type 2 diabetes include: Being overweight Not getting enough exercise Being 45 or older Having a family member with Type 2 diabetes Certain racial and ethnic groups are more at risk, including African-Americans and Hispanics. Unlike Type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an immune reaction, Type 2 diabetes develops over the course of years. So incremental improvements such as the ones seen in the MUSC-led study are important. ""It wasn't a huge, overwhelming difference,"" O'Neil said. ""But it was scalable, meaning it could be applied to the whole population."" The whole population of people with Type 2 diabetes includes more than 20 million Americans. It's by far the more common form of diabetes and can lead to about $85,000 in medical costs. Diabetes is a growing problem. O'Neil said the rate jumped from about 9 percent to 12 percent between 2002 and 2012. Weight loss is seen as a good way to slow its progression. The MUSC Health Weight Management Center takes a scientific approach to weight loss, focusing on changes in activity levels, behavior, thinking, diet and support systems. O'Neil said it's important to help people, not blame them. The Weight Watchers study is new evidence of what that help might include when it comes to a side effect of weight gain: Type 2 diabetes.

"Data published by Alzheon in the Journal of the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease is the first report to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted drug with the number of APOE4 alleles FRAMINGHAM, Mass., October 24, 2016 - Results published today in The Journal of the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (JPAD) describe analyses of Phase 3 data for the investigational amyloid-targeted drug, tramiprosate, in patients with Mild to Moderate Alzheimer's disease (AD). These efficacy analyses evaluated patient subgroups based on the number of ε4 alleles of apolipoprotein E (APOE4), a major genetic risk factor in up to 65 percent of patients with AD. 1,2 The published results showed a gene-dose effect at the high dose of tramiprosate (150 mg, twice daily), with patients with two APOE4 alleles (APOE4/4 homozygotes) showing the largest clinical benefit, those with one APOE4 allele (APOE4 heterozygotes) showing an intermediate benefit, while APOE4 non-carriers showed no benefit from tramiprosate. The results published in JPAD are the first evidence from a large clinical trial to associate efficacy of an amyloid-targeted agent with APOE4 status in AD patients. The manuscript, titled ""Clinical Benefits of Tramiprosate in Alzheimer's Disease Are Associated with Higher Number of APOE4 Alleles: The 'APOE4 Gene-Dose Effect',"" is featured in the advanced online publication of The Journal of the Prevention of Alzheimer's Disease (JPAD) 3 with lead authors from Alzheon, Inc., a biopharmaceutical company focused on treatments for neurodegenerative and neuropsychiatric disorders. Based on the analyses in the publication, Alzheon is developing ALZ-801, an optimized oral prodrug of tramiprosate, and has refined the design of the pivotal clinical trial to evaluate ALZ-801 as a potential disease-modifying agent in symptomatic AD patients who are APOE4/4 homozygotes. Anton P. Porsteinsson, MD, Professor of Psychiatry at the University of Rochester School of Medicine and Dentistry and Director of the Alzheimer's Disease Care, Research and Education Program at the University of Rochester in Rochester, NY, and an investigator in the North American Phase 3 clinical trial, commented: ""The genetically-defined population of APOE4 carriers has an 8-12 fold increased risk of developing AD and has more rapidly progressive disease, usually becoming symptomatic a decade earlier than non-carriers of the APOE4 genotype. These analyses with tramiprosate in the APOE4 subgroups are compelling, and suggest a meaningful clinical benefit, on top of the existing symptomatic AD treatments, in Alzheimer's patients who are in great need of new treatments. We can apply these insights about the therapeutic response of APOE4 carriers to refine patient selection and potentially improve the success rate of new Alzheimer's medicines."" The efficacy and safety analyses with tramiprosate published in JPAD reveal a therapeutic effect in patients who are carriers of APOE4 after segmenting them from the larger, non-genetically-defined study population in the Phase 3 clinical program, involving more than 2,000 AD patients in North America and Europe. In the overall Mild and Moderate AD study population with baseline MMSE of 16-26 (and any APOE genotype), the North American study did not demonstrate a significant benefit with either of two tramiprosate doses (100 mg BID and 150 mg BID), compared to placebo, during the 78-week study period. 4 As a result, the European study was terminated before completion, and the results were not previously published. ""To our knowledge, this is the first time that the clinical benefits of an amyloid-targeted agent have been associated with the number of APOE4 alleles in Alzheimer's patients. This new insight shows how we can apply a precision medicine approach in AD and develop this drug for the right patients, namely patients with the APOE4 genotype, which carries the highest risk as well as the earliest onset and faster disease progression,"" said Martin Tolar, MD, PhD, Founder, President and CEO of Alzheon. ""These newly-published findings form the basis for the design of our Phase 3 program, and further support our company's commitment to advance ALZ-801 into pivotal studies in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients who represent up to 15% of AD patients1. We are preparing to advance ALZ-801, a promising new treatment for Alzheimer's disease, into confirmatory clinical studies in 2017."" The observed gene-dose effects of tramiprosate in APOE4 carriers are consistent with the prevalence of amyloid pathology in AD patients. Amyloid imaging in AD clinical trials has shown the highest prevalence of positive amyloid scans in APOE4/4 homozygotes, and the lowest prevalence in APOE4 non-carriers. 5 As one of the few orally-administered amyloid-targeted agents, tramiprosate blocks the aggregation of beta amyloid monomers into toxic oligomers, and was developed to show efficacy in patients with amyloid pathology and an accurate diagnosis of AD. Efficacy Results in APOE4/4 Homozygous Patients from the JPAD Phase 3 Analyses The published results showed the largest clinical benefit in the Alzheimer's APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients, who represent approximately 15 percent of patients in the study.3 APOE4/4 homozygous patients who received the high dose of tramiprosate showed efficacy benefit compared to placebo on both cognitive and functional measures in the Phase 3 analyses. The effects on the ADAS-cog cognitive outcome were significant at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 3.47, nominal p = 0.007) and Week 78 (2.60, nominal p = 0.043), and corresponded to 66 percent and 40 percent benefit from tramiprosate compared to placebo. These effects were supported by functional benefits on the CDR-SB that showed a positive trend at Week 65 (LS means difference from placebo: 0.79, nominal p = 0.063) and were numerically in favor of tramiprosate at Week 78 (0.54, nominal p = 0.21). ""APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients are especially challenging since they are known to have the highest burden of amyloid pathology in cerebral cortex and blood vessels, which explains their susceptibility to ARIA-E with some amyloid-targeted treatments. In these new subgroup analyses, the high dose of tramiprosate showed promising clinical effects in APOE4/4 homozygous AD patients already receiving maximal standard of care, and this dose was not associated with any events of vasogenic edema,"" said Susan Abushakra, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Alzheon and lead author on the JPAD publication. ""Replication of these findings in Alzheon's planned Phase 3 study would provide a meaningful therapeutic advance for AD patients with the APOE4/4 genotype, and we are now preparing to carry forward these results into the development of ALZ-801."" Safety Results from the JPAD Phase 3 Analyses The safety profile of tramiprosate in 2,025 AD patients across the two studies was favorable and similar in the APOE4 carriers and non-carriers. The main adverse events were gastrointestinal (nausea, vomiting and weight loss), which were mild or moderate in severity. New ARIA-E safety analyses were reported in the JPAD publication. Brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) evaluations in 426 patients were conducted during the Phase 3 studies and did not reveal any events of vasogenic brain edema (ARIA-E or amyloid-related imaging abnormalities-edema) on either dose of tramiprosate. Vasogenic edema (or brain swelling) is a side effect observed in clinical studies with some injectable anti-amyloid antibodies, which requires MRI monitoring and can occasionally be serious. 6 About Tramiprosate and the New Prodrug ALZ-801 In 2013, Alzheon obtained the license to tramiprosate and the associated portfolio of drug compounds, along with the historical clinical dataset, and applied new insights to the existing data. This led to the development of an optimized oral, amyloid-targeted drug candidate, ALZ-801. Alzheon developed ALZ-801 as a novel oral prodrug of tramiprosate, designed to improve the pharmacokinetic and gastrointestinal tolerability profile, while retaining tramiprosate as the active agent in ALZ-801. Phase 1 studies in more than 170 subjects, including healthy elderly, showed that ALZ-801 provides consistent plasma levels of tramiprosate, with very low inter-subject variability. The rate of nausea and vomiting was also lower than with tramiprosate tablets. ALZ-801 at the dose of 265 mg provided equivalent systemic plasma exposures to tramiprosate 150 mg tablets. Alzheon is advancing ALZ-801 into pivotal Phase 3 studies in the genetically-defined APOE4/4 homozygous patients with Alzheimer's disease. About Apolipoprotein E Apolipoprotein E, or APOE, is a gene that provides a predictive window into an individual's Alzheimer's disease prognosis. APOE encodes for a protein called apolipoprotein E, which combines with fats to form lipoproteins that can be moved throughout the body. In the brain, apolipoprotein E helps shuttle cholesterol to neurons to support their normal function. There are three forms, or alleles, of the APOE gene, called ε2, ε3 and ε4. The ε4 allele has been found to correlate with high risk of developing Alzheimer's disease. People who inherit one copy of the ε4 allele, APOE4 heterozygotes, have an increased chance of developing the disease; those who inherit two copies of the allele, APOE4 homozygotes, are at even greater risk and tend to have more aggressive disease. The ε4 allele is significantly overrepresented in the Alzheimer's disease population compared to the general population: up to 65 percent of Alzheimer's patients carry one or two copies of the ε4 allele compared to about 25 percent of the general population. ### About Alzheon Alzheon, Inc. is committed to developing innovative medicines by directly addressing the underlying pathology of devastating neurodegenerative disorders.

"An immunotherapy drug has been hailed as a potential 'game changer' after being found to greatly improve survival for patients with relapsed head and neck cancer - a disease which is notoriously difficult to treat. Nivolumab became the first treatment to extend survival in a phase III clinical trial for patients with head and neck cancer in whom chemotherapy had failed - and it did so with fewer side-effects than existing therapeutic options. More than double the number of patients taking nivolumab were alive after one year as those treated with chemotherapy, reported the major international trial, published today (Sunday) in the New England Journal of Medicine. There are currently no other treatment options that improve the survival of patients with cisplatin-resistant relapsed or metastatic head and neck cancers. This group of patients are expected to live less than six months. The trial was led in the UK by Professor Kevin Harrington of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, and involved 20 research organisations from around the world. It was funded by Bristol Myers Squibb. Of the 361 patients in the trial, 240 with relapsed or metastatic head and neck cancer were allocated to receive nivolumab and 121 to one of three different chemotherapies. UK patients received the chemotherapy drug docetaxel, which is the only treatment approved for advanced head and neck cancer by NICE. After one year of the study, 36 per cent of patients treated with nivolumab were still alive compared with 17 per cent for the comparator arm. Median survival for patients on nivolumab was 7.5 months, compared with 5.1 months for chemotherapy. The survival benefit was more pronounced in patients whose tumours had tested positive for human papillomavirus (HPV). These patients survived an average of 9.1 months with nivolumab and 4.4 months with chemotherapy. HPV-negative patients survived an average of 7.5 months with nivolumab and 5.8 with chemotherapy. Importantly, fewer patients experienced serious side-effects from taking nivolumab than with conventional treatment - only 13 per cent compared with 35 per cent of patients who received chemotherapy. Patients given chemotherapy reported feeling physically, socially and emotionally worse off, whereas those who were given nivolumab remained stable during the course of treatment. Professor Harrington will be presenting some of the findings at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen, simultaneously with publication. Nivolumab will still have to go through approval by the European Medicines Agency and NICE before it is available for head and neck cancer patients on the NHS. UK trial lead Professor Kevin Harrington, Professor of Biological Cancer Therapies at The Institute of Cancer Research, London, and Consultant at The Royal Marsden NHS Foundation Trust, said: ""Nivolumab could be a real game-changer for patients with advanced head and neck cancer. This trial found that it can greatly extend life among a group of patients who have no existing treatment options, without worsening quality of life. ""Once it has relapsed or spread, head and neck cancer is extremely difficult to treat. So it's great news that these results indicate we now have a new treatment that can significantly extend life, and I'm keen to see it enter the clinic as soon as possible."" Professor Paul Workman, Chief Executive of The Institute of Cancer Research, London, said: ""Nivolumab is one of a new wave of immunotherapies that are beginning to have an impact across cancer treatment. This phase III clinical trial expands the repertoire of nivolumab even further, showing that it is the first treatment to have significant benefits in relapsed head and neck cancer. ""We hope regulators can work with the manufacturer to avoid delays in getting this drug to patients who have no effective treatment options left to them."" ### Some of the data was presented at 16:25 CEST today (Sunday) at the European Society for Medical Oncology 2016 Congress in Copenhagen.

"Researchers have found evidence that a natural fruit extract is capable of dissolving calcium oxalate crystals, the most common component of human kidney stones. This finding could lead to the first advance in the treatment of calcium oxalate stones in 30 years. Jeffrey Rimer, associate professor of chemical engineering at the University of Houston, was lead author of the study, published Aug. 8 in the online edition of Nature. The work offers the first evidence that the compound hydroxycitrate (HCA) is an effective inhibitor of calcium oxalate crystal growth that, under certain conditions, is actually able to dissolve these crystals. Researchers also explain how it works. The findings are the result of a combination of experimental studies, computational studies and human studies, Rimer said. Kidney stones are small, hard mineral deposits that form inside the kidneys, affecting up to 12 percent of men and seven percent of women. High blood pressure, diabetes and obesity can increase the risk, and the reported incidence is on the rise. Preventive treatment has not changed much over the last three decades. Doctors tell patients who are at risk of developing stones to drink lots of water and avoid foods rich in oxalate, such as rhubarb, okra, spinach and almonds. They often recommend taking citrate (CA), in the form of potassium citrate, a supplement that can slow crystal growth, but some people are unable to tolerate the side effects. The project grew out of preliminary work done by collaborator John Asplin, a nephrologist at Litholink Corporation, who suggested HCA as a possible treatment. HCA is chemically similar to CA and is also available as a dietary supplement. ""HCA shows promise as a potential therapy to prevent kidney stones,"" the researchers wrote. ""HCA may be preferred as a therapy over CA (potassium citrate)."" In addition to Rimer and Asplin, authors on the paper include Giannis Mpourmpakis and his graduate student, Michael G. Taylor, of the University of Pittsburgh; Ignacio Granja of Litholink Corporation, and Jihae Chung, a UH graduate student working in Rimer's lab. The head-to-head studies of CA and HCA determined that while both compounds inhibit the growth of calcium oxalate crystals, HCA was more potent and displayed unique qualities that are advantageous for the development of new therapies. The team of researchers then used atomic force microscopy, or AFM, to study interactions between the crystals, CA and HCA under realistic growth conditions. According to Rimer, the technique allowed them to record crystal growth in real time with near-molecular resolution. Chung noted that the AFM images recorded the crystal actually shrinking when exposed to specific concentrations of HCA. Rimer suspected the initial finding was an abnormality, as it is rare to see a crystal actually dissolve in highly supersaturated growth solutions. The most effective inhibitors reported in the literature simply stop the crystal from growing. It turned out that Chung's initial finding was correct. Once they confirmed it is possible to dissolve crystals in supersaturated solutions, researchers then looked at reasons to explain why that happened. Mpourmpakis and Taylor applied density functional theory (DFT) - a highly accurate computational method used to study the structure and properties of materials - to address how HCA and CA bind to calcium and to calcium oxalate crystals. They discovered HCA formed a stronger bond with crystal surfaces, inducing a strain that is seemingly relieved by the release of calcium and oxalate, leading to crystal dissolution. HCA was also tested in human subjects, as seven people took the supplement for three days, allowing researchers to determine that HCA is excreted through urine, a requirement for the supplement to work as a treatment. While Rimer said the research established the groundwork to design an effective drug, questions remain. Long-term safety, dosage and additional human trials are needed, he said. ""But our initial findings are very promising,"" he said. ""If it works in vivo, similar to our trials in the laboratory, HCA has the potential to reduce the incidence rate of people with chronic kidney stone disease."" ###",0,news_reviews_00383
"(Edmonton, AB) Groundbreaking research from the University of Alberta and McGill University has opened the door towards the future prevention of cardiac fibrosis--a condition leading to heart failure for which there is currently no treatment. The collaborative study, funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research and published in PLOS One, examined the molecular mechanisms that lead to cardiac fibrosis in a pre-clinical model. The study discovered the specific triggers activating the development of fibrosis which accelerates heart failure. Blocking the triggers through the use of a specific kind of bile acid prevented cardiac fibrosis from occurring. ""This is something that nobody has ever seen before,"" says Marek Michalak, co-principal investigator and a distinguished professor in the Department of Biochemistry at the University of Alberta's Faculty of Medicine & Dentistry. ""Cardiac fibrosis is considered a permanent remodeling of the heart. Inevitably it leads to heart failure and eventually death. The bottom line is that this shows for the first time that cardiac fibrosis is preventable."" ""It offers hope to those who are living with heart failure,"" adds Luis Agellon, co-principal investigator and a professor at McGill University's School of Dietetics and Human Nutrition. ""Prevention of fibrosis will extend the ability of the heart to function, even if at a reduced capacity. Currently patients with heart failure have poor quality of life and a dismal prognosis. Improving their quality of life will do wonders for these individuals."" Fibrosis is an early step on the path to heart failure. According to the Heart and Stroke Foundation there are currently 1.3 million Canadians living with heart disease or heart failure--a condition that severely limits physical activity because the heart cannot pump enough oxygenated blood that the body needs. About 30 per cent of patients diagnosed with heart failure will die within the first year. Cardiac fibrosis itself is caused by a variety of factors including high blood pressure, overwork of cardiac muscle and long-term consumption of a diet that is high in both saturated fat and sugar--all cause increased stress to heart cells. Individuals with diabetes, cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and heart transplant recipients are also known to be at high risk. ""It's almost like building a scar,"" says Michalak. ""It's exactly the same type of biological activity but it's happening in the heart tissue. It destroys the ability of the heart to function normally."" The team is now pushing forward with additional studies to see if the same therapeutic effect can be achieved in humans. They also aim to gain a better understanding of exactly how bile acids can prevent cardiac fibrosis from occurring. ""We don't yet have a full understanding--nobody does--of how the bile acid actually does what it does in heart cells,"" explains Michalak. ""So, another phase of the work is to find out what actually happens within heart cells at the molecular level. How can this bile acid affect the heart in such a dramatic way?"" Once that occurs, the team hopes to work with cardiologists to quickly move the research into clinical trials, involving chemotherapy and heart transplant patients. ""If cardiac fibrosis can be stopped, then that could substantially improve the outcome for people at risk,"" says Agellon. ""This would be a significant advance in the fight against heart disease."" ### This research was supported by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research.

"International Study Finds Effective, Less Toxic Way to Treat Brain Tumors Newswise — CHARLOTTE, N.C., July 26, 2016 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Physicians from Carolinas HealthCare System's Neurosciences Institute and Levine Cancer Institute are among the authors of a study that was accepted for publication by the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA). The study, released on July 26, 2016, shows that patients with the most common form of brain tumor can be treated in an effective and substantially less toxic way by omitting a widely used portion of radiation therapy. These results will allow tens of thousands of patients with brain tumors to experience a better quality of life while maintaining the same length of life. Anthony L. Asher, MD, FACS, medical director at Carolinas HealthCare System's Neurosciences Institute and the senior author on the report, and as well as Stuart H. Burri, MD, chairman, department of radiation oncology at Levine Cancer Institute, began their research on this subject over 10 years ago in Charlotte, North Carolina. Along with Dr. Paul Brown at Mayo Clinic, they spearheaded an international, multi-institutional, randomized trial that will ultimately improve the standard of care for patients with a specific type of brain tumor, brain metastases, by reducing the toxicity of their treatment without reducing the effectiveness. Typical therapies for these types of brain tumors include surgery, whole brain radiation therapy and focused radiation, also known as stereotactic radiosurgery. ""We discovered that whole brain radiation added to focused radiation in the treatment of brain metastases – in other words, cancer that travels to the brain- reduces the number of new brain tumors over time; however, patients receiving the whole brain radiation had significantly more difficulties with memory and complex thinking than patients who only had the focused radiation,"" says Dr. Asher. ""Whole brain radiation patients also reported worse quality of life compared with patients who only received the focused radiation,"" adds Dr. Burri. ""Interestingly, the data showed that the addition of whole brain radiation produced no improvement in survival."" According to the American Cancer Society, in 2016, there will be approximately 1.7 million new cancer cases diagnosed in the United States. Almost one in four of those patients (about 400,000) will experience spread of their cancers to the brain. In contrast, 300,000 and 240,000 patients will be newly diagnosed with breast and primary lung cancers, respectively, each year. ""Brain metastases are not only extremely common, they are also a major source of disability in society,"" says Dr. Asher. Because of their location, these tumors often produce severe neurological symptoms, such as headaches, weakness or problems with speech and information processing, thereby compromising both daily function and quality of life in cancer patients. According to Dr. Asher, there are two primary objectives in cancer care: To improve survivalTo maintain or improve quality of life for patients""The first and highest rule of medical care is 'do no harm,'"" says Dr. Asher. ""Consistent with that obligation, when it isn't possible to extend survival with various therapies, it's absolutely essential that we work to reduce or eliminate any possibility that quality of life will be compromised by treatments. Another way to state that principle for cancer care, is that when two cancer therapies produce similar survival, it's important to understand which therapy offers patients a better quality of life."" In this study, although whole brain radiation decreased the number of new brain tumors over time, its addition to focused radiation interestingly did not result in a survival benefit over focused radiation alone. Furthermore, whole brain therapy was associated with considerably worse quality of life. ""In the past, clinicians who treated patients with brain tumors seldom used sophisticated techniques like neurocognitive tests to evaluate patients' daily function in response to various therapies,"" said Dr. Burri. ""Without those tests, we might have incorrectly concluded that whole brain radiation was a better option for patients because it made their scans look better, at least in the short term. However, the data from our study shows that clinicians can no longer simply rely on the results of traditional lab tests or scans to assess the value of care; we have to understand the total impact of cancer therapies on our patients."" Drs. Asher and Burri emphasize that the real importance of this study is its potential to make us think differently about what really matters in cancer therapy. The trial authors concluded that the benefit of adding whole brain radiation was outweighed by its risks in patients with one to three newly diagnosed brain metastases. This is a very relevant finding, as over 200,000 patients still receive whole brain radiation in the United States each year, and the majority of patients with brain metastases have a limited number (typically three or less) of brain lesions. Drs. Asher and Burri, along with their co-investigators, now recommend that patients with one to three brain metastases should no longer receive routine whole brain radiation therapy, and should be treated with focused therapy alone to better preserve cognitive function and quality of life. ""Having the research published in JAMA is validation of more than a decade of work,"" says Dr. Burri. "" It is deeply satisfying to have developed an important scientific project, work in close collaboration with other investigators to obtain support from the National Cancer Institute, then carry the to carry the trial to completion with publication of impactful results in one of the leading medical journals in the world."" Drs. Asher and Burri are now working on a new method of focused therapy for tumors that have spread to the brain that combines radiation and surgery. The technique was pioneered at Levine Cancer Institute and they are looking to expand and further validate the approach with the National Cancer Institute.

"Newswise — COLORADO SPRINGS, CO – Shoulder instability is most common in the young, athletic population, bringing a focus to how these injuries are best treated. Research presented today at the American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine's (AOSSM) Annual Meeting in Colorado Springs, CO, demonstrated that surgery after a first-time shoulder dislocation lowered the re-injury risks and need for follow-up surgery when compared to those who were initially treated non-operatively and experienced a repeat dislocation prior to surgery. The study examined 121 patients at an average of 51 months post-surgery. Of this group, 68 patients had experienced their first dislocation, while 53 had recurrent dislocations after being initially treated non-operatively. After treatment with an arthroscopic bankart repair, the postoperative dislocation rate in the first-time injury group was 29%, compared to 62% in those who did not have surgery after their initial injury. The average age of patients was 19 years old. ""Deciding between a non-operative program or going forward with surgery can be a challenging decision for medical professionals treating shoulder injuries in young athletes,"" noted the study's lead author Tyler J. Marshall, MD, from Alabama Ortho Spine and Sports in Birmingham, AL. ""However, this study shows a substantial benefit for athletes undergoing surgery to prevent recurrent instability down the road."" The research data was collected between 2003 and 2013 from eight fellowship trained surgical practices, with patient ages ranging from 16 to 30 years old. Surveys given to patients during follow-ups asked for information such as test for shoulder functionality, whether patients returned to sport, postoperative instability events, and if further surgery was required on the shoulder. ""While young athletes and parents may be wary of surgery, our study shows the advantages of this treatment approach,"" commented Marshall. ""Physicians should counsel those with first time injuries on these benefits moving forward."" ### The American Orthopaedic Society for Sports Medicine (AOSSM) is a global leader in orthopaedic sports medicine education, research, communication and fellowship, and includes national and international sports medicine leaders. The Society works closely with many other sports medicine specialists, including athletic trainers, physical therapists, family physicians, and others to improve the identification, prevention, treatment, and rehabilitation of sports injuries. AOSSM is also a founding partner of the STOP Sports Injuries campaign to prevent overuse and traumatic injuries in kids",0,news_reviews_00397
"Key Points Question Does treatment with cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) increase the rate of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival compared with radiotherapy alone in patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma? Findings In this secondary analysis of a randomized clinical trial comparing CRT vs radiotherapy alone in 168 treated patients, there was no difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years. There was a 4.0% and 8.9% absolute improvement in laryngectomy-free survival at 2 and 3 years, respectively, for CRT vs radiotherapy alone. Meaning The results of this secondary subset analysis reveal a possible cetuximab-related benefit in laryngeal preservation. Abstract Importance The appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy-based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate. Unfortunately, there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in the last 30 years. Objective To assess the rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival in patients receiving cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) and patients receiving radiotherapy alone. Design, Setting, and Participants Patients were enrolled in a multicenter, open-label, stratified, randomized, phase 3 study from April 1, 1999, through March 31, 2002, from 73 centers in the United States and 14 other countries. A secondary subgroup analysis of patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal carcinoma was undertaken. Rates of laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival were estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method. The hazard ratios (HRs) were calculated using a Cox proportional hazards regression model. Quality of life was evaluated using the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer core questionnaire and head and neck module. Main Outcomes and Measures Laryngeal preservation and laryngectomy-free survival. Results Of the 424 patients included in the trial, 168 treated patients with cancer of the larynx or hypopharynx were included in this analysis (90 in the CRT group and 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). The median (range) age of the patients was 59 (40-80) years in the CRT group and 61 (35-81) years in the radiotherapy alone group. In the CRT group, 72 patients (80.0%) were male and 18 (20.0%) were female. In the radiotherapy alone group, 62 (79.5%) were male and 16 (20.5%) were female. The rates of laryngeal preservation at 2 years were 87.9% for CRT vs 85.7% for radiotherapy alone, with an HR of 0.57 (95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). Similarly, the HR for laryngectomy-free survival comparing CRT vs radiotherapy alone was 0.78 (95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17). This study was not powered to assess organ preservation. Median overall survival was 27 (95% CI, 20-45) vs 21 (95% CI, 17-35) months for the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups, respectively, with an HR of 0.87 (95% CI, 0.60-1.27). No differences between treatments were reported regarding overall quality of life, need for a feeding tube, or speech. Conclusions and Relevance The results of a possible cetuximab-related laryngeal preservation benefit for patients with hypopharyngeal or laryngeal cancer are intriguing; these results need to be interpreted in the context of a retrospective subset analysis with limited sample size. Trial Registration clinicaltrials.gov Identifier: NCT00004227 Introduction Historically, locoregionally advanced squamous cell cancers of the larynx or hypopharynx have been treated with surgical resection, usually involving laryngectomy with or without postoperative radiotherapy.1 Although laryngectomy is an effective treatment, investigators have sought therapeutic strategies that result in voice preservation. Various modifications of surgical techniques have been explored.2-5 Alternatively, in the early 1980s, investigators evaluated curative primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery as an option for these patients.6,7 Retrospective studies8,9 that compared primary radiotherapy with salvage surgery to initial surgery with postoperative radiotherapy found similar rates of survival in patients with advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. After the realization that many patients could avoid total laryngectomy with the use of primary radiotherapy, several combination chemoradiotherapy strategies were introduced for patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. In large phase 3 randomized clinical trials, induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy demonstrated equivalent overall survival compared with surgical resection and postoperative radiotherapy in patients with laryngeal10,11 and hypopharyngeal cancers.12 More recently, the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial revealed that radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin resulted in a superior laryngeal preservation rate compared with induction with cisplatin and fluorouracil followed by radiotherapy or radiotherapy alone for these advanced laryngeal cancers.13,14 However, this treatment did not produce a survival benefit. The appropriate use of surgery or radiotherapy-based approaches for organ preservation has been the subject of much debate.15-18 Unfortunately, there has been a lack of improvement in overall survival for patients with laryngeal carcinoma in large database studies19-21 examining the last 30 years of care. Investigators have reported that poor follow-up may contribute to the potential for larger and less curable recurrences, and surgeons experienced with radiotherapy with salvage surgery need to be involved as early as possible.20,21 The analysis described in this report was performed to assess the laryngeal preservation rates of patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers who were entered into a randomized clinical trial of cetuximab and radiotherapy (CRT) compared with radiotherapy alone.22,23 This group of patients represents a subgroup (168 patients) of a larger population (424 patients) that also included patients with oropharyngeal cancers. It is noteworthy that this randomized clinical trial was not designed to enroll a sufficient number of patients to definitively and prospectively address the subject of the analysis reported herein. Previous reports22,23 of the overall randomized clinical trial found locoregional control and survival advantages associated with the addition of cetuximab to radiotherapy. Methods Patients Patients were enrolled in the multicenter, open-label, stratified, randomized, phase 3 study from April 1, 1999, through March 31, 2002, from 73 centers in the United States and 14 other countries. Patients who entered the trial had stage III or IV nonmetastatic squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx, hypopharynx, or larynx (Figure 1 and Table 1). Patients were eligible if they had pathologically confirmed stage III or IV squamous cell carcinoma, had measurable disease, had no distant metastases, had no prior therapy for the tumor under study, and were medically suitable to undergo definitive radiotherapy. This subgroup includes the patients with hypopharyngeal and laryngeal cancers. The protocol was approved by the ethics review boards at the participating institutions, and all the patients provided written informed consent. Patients were initially evaluated with a comprehensive head and neck examination, which included panendoscopy. The primary tumors and lymph nodes were staged by the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging classification of 1998. Initial evaluation included computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region and chest radiography. Patients began treatment within 2 weeks after this initial evaluation, as determined by the randomization procedure.22 Patients who underwent no surgery or less extensive operations were censored at death or date of last contact. Treatment The primary radiotherapy was delivered with curative intent. Investigators selected 1 of 3 radiation fractionation regimens: once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost regimen (Figure 1). Cervical lymph node drainage regions, considered to be at high risk for subclinical disease, were treated with a dose of 50 to 54 Gy. The primary tumor and gross nodal disease received full-dose radiotherapy (70-76.8 Gy, depending on fractionation). However, if a postoperative neck dissection was planned, gross nodal disease could be treated with 60 Gy. For patients randomized to CRT, cetuximab treatment consisted of an initial dose of 400 mg/m2 and was delivered as a 120-minute intravenous infusion. This initial dose was delivered 1 week before the initiation of CRT. Patients received weekly cetuximab infusions during the radiotherapy treatment. Seven weekly infusions were delivered at a dose of 250 mg/m2 for a period of 60 minutes each. For patients who were scheduled to have a planned neck dissection, surgery was scheduled to take place 4 to 8 weeks after completion of CRT or radiotherapy alone. Evaluations Evaluations, including physical examination, hematologic testing, and chemical profiles, were performed weekly for the duration of the study. A pharmacologic profile was also performed weekly on patients receiving cetuximab infusion (CRT group). Patients provided a history and underwent a physical examination, which included a fiberoptic examination of the tumor, as well as an assessment of all study end points at required time points after the completion of treatment.22 Posttreatment assessments were performed 4 and 8 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Patients who were scheduled for a planned postoperative neck dissection could have their 8-week assessment at the 6-week time point, along with posttreatment computed tomography. Subsequently, patients were evaluated every 4 months during the first and second years. They were evaluated semiannually during years 3 to 5. These follow-up assessments included imaging studies, consisting of computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging of the head and neck region. Quality of Life The instruments used in this study were the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality of Life Questionnaire Core 30 version 3.0 and the Quality of Life Head and Neck Module 35. The self-administered core questionnaire consisted of 30 questions and incorporated 5 functional scales, 3 symptom scales, and a global health and quality-of-life scale. The remaining single items assessed additional symptoms commonly reported by patients with cancer, as well as the perceived financial effect of disease and treatment. All scales and single items met the standards for reliability. The 35-item module comprised 1 multi-item scale and a series of single items assessing head and neck–associated symptoms and adverse effects from conventional therapy. Statistical Analysis The randomization was not stratified by primary site of cancer; hence, the results presented below are a retrospective analysis of the selected subset of patients. A CONSORT flow diagram was included with the original publication of the trial.23 A trial profile for the analysis presented here is shown in Figure 1. The primary end point of the study was to examine differences in the rate of locoregional disease control maintained for 1 year. The duration of locoregional control was defined as the absence of locoregional disease progression at the scheduled follow-up visits and was determined through a masked review of the investigator-generated data by an independent committee of experts. The duration of locoregional control was from randomization to the first documented progression or recurrence of locoregional disease or death from any cause. Overall survival was calculated from randomization to death from any cause. Tumor present in a neck dissection, which was performed for any reason after 15 weeks after radiotherapy, constituted locoregional progression. Distribution of time-to-event parameters was estimated by the Kaplan-Meier method, and treatment effects were compared using a log-rank test. The Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to calculate the nonstratified hazard ratio (HR). The Kaplan-Meier method was also used to estimate the rate of preservation of larynx.24 Patients who underwent no surgery or lesser operations were censored at death or date of last contact. Results Characteristics of the Patients A total of 424 patients participated in the study and 168 were included in the subanalysis (90 in the CRT group or 78 in the radiotherapy alone group). Most patients from both treatment groups were treated with the concomitant boost fractionation regimen. The 2 treatment groups were well balanced with respect to sex, tumor stage, node stage (Table 1), and the rate of neck surgery (16% in the CRT group and 14% in the radiotherapy alone group). Treatment Adherence The median durations of treatment were 52, 46, and 43 days for once daily, twice daily, or concomitant boost, respectively, for patients treated with CRT and 52, 44, and 43 days, respectively, for patients treated with radiotherapy alone. For patients who received cetuximab, the median number of cetuximab infusions was 8 (range, 1–11). The median cumulative cetuximab dose was 2154 mg/m2 (range, 14-2887 mg/m2). The number of patients who received 7 or more cetuximab infusions was 80 (88.9%). The radiotherapy quality assurance review found that the mean and median doses for the once daily, twice daily, and concomitant boost regimens were 68.7 and 70.0 Gy, 74.3 and 74.4 Gy, and 70.8 and 72.0 Gy, respectively; these doses were similar in both treatment groups. Radiotherapy adherence for patients who received CRT or radiotherapy alone was balanced; 65 (72.2%) received CRT and 56 (71.8%) received radiotherapy alone as planned or with minor deviation. A total of 121 patients (72%) were treated as planned or with minor deviation. Major acceptable deviations in the CRT and radiotherapy alone groups were found in 13 (14.4%) and 13 (16.7%) patients, and major unacceptable deviations were observed in 3 (3.3%) and 5 (6.4%) patients, respectively. A total of 9 (10.0%) and 4 (5.1%) patients in these respective groups were not evaluable for a radiation quality assurance review. The differences in radiotherapy adherence between the 2 treatment groups were not statistically significant. Neck dissections were performed in 14 patients (15.6%) treated with CRT and 11 patients (14.1%) treated with radiotherapy alone. Efficacy Locoregional control was the primary end point of the phase 3 study. For this subgroup of patients with laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, locoregional control was slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.80; 95% CI, 0.56-1.13) (Table 2). The 2-year rates of locoregional control were 36.9% in the CRT group and 25.7% in the radiotherapy alone group. Survival was also slightly improved for patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.60-1.27) (Table 2). The 3-year survival rates were 41.9% in the CRT group and 39.0% in the radiotherapy alone group. The rates of laryngeal preservation (no need for salvage laryngectomy) were 87.9% at 2 and 3 years in the CRT group compared with 85.7% at 2 years and 76.8% at 3 years in the radiotherapy alone group. The 2.2% and 11.1% absolute improvements in the rates of laryngeal preservation, at 2 and 3 years, respectively, favored CRT compared with radiotherapy alone (Figure 2). However, this improvement was not statistically significant (HR, 0.57; 95% CI, 0.23-1.42; P = .22). In addition, there was a 4.0% and 8.9% absolute improvement in laryngectomy-free survival at 2 and 3 years, respectively. Again, these differences did not reach statistical significance (HR, 0.78; 95% CI, 0.54-1.11; P = .17) (Figure 2). Safety The most frequently reported adverse events are given in Table 3. The frequency of grades 3 and 4 mucositis/stomatitis and odynophagia was not significantly different among patients who received CRT compared with radiotherapy alone. Patients who received CRT had a greater rate of acneiform rash compared with patients who received radiotherapy alone (Table 3). Chills, fever, and headache were the only toxic events reported to occur at any grade with significantly higher frequency (P = .002, P = .01, and P = .004, respectively) in patients in the CRT group than in the radiotherapy alone group; however, their incidences were low (chills, 16 [17.8%] vs 2 [2.6%]; fever, 20 [22.2%] vs 6 [7.7%]; headache, 20 [22.2%] vs 5 [6.4%]). Quality of Life The quality-of-life responses were evaluated in a longitudinal design in all patients. Baseline assessment was performed at or just after randomization. Subsequent assessments took place before the beginning of the fourth week of radiotherapy, at the 8-week posttreatment evaluation, and at the 2 every-4-month follow-up evaluations of year 1. Plots of mean changes in global health status, use of a feeding tube, or speech problems reveal no differences between the treatment groups (Figure 3). A positive value in change indicates an improvement for the patient. Differences in mean changes in swallowing at radiotherapy week 4 (−15 in the CRT group and −25 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02), loss of appetite at radiotherapy week 4 (−11 in the CRT group and −18 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .03), nausea at week 8 after radiotherapy (−7.3 in the CRT group and 0.3 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), coughing at radiotherapy week 4 (7.4 in the CRT group and −5.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .02) and at week 8 after radiotherapy (−3.2 in the CRT group and 1.1 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04), constipation at month 8 (2.6 in the CRT group and −19 in the radiotherapy alone group, P < .001), and cognitive functioning at month 12 (−7.0 in the CRT group and 4.6 in the radiotherapy alone group, P = .04) were not seen at the other time points. Discussion When laryngectomy is the primary treatment for locoregionally advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers, patients gradually adjust to the loss of natural phonation, but the condition substantially interferes with normal communication and social interactions.25 In addition, although the effect of the procedure on voice frequently receives the greatest consideration, the presence of the stoma may also adversely affect patients' quality of life.26 In the analysis reported herein, laryngeal preservation rates were studied in a subgroup of patients who were part of a large phase 3 trial that compared primary radiotherapy with or without the antiepidermal growth factor receptor monoclonal antibody cetuximab. The use of CRT produced a higher rate of laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone for patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers. Although the difference in the rates of laryngeal preservation between the 2 groups did not reach statistical significance, the initial trial was not powered to assess this subgroup question. The HR of 0.57 is a strong indicator that cetuximab, when added to radiotherapy, may improve laryngeal preservation. The 87.9% rate of laryngeal preservation at 2 years for CRT found in this trial is similar to the rate reported for the use of radiotherapy and concomitant cisplatin in Radiation Therapy Oncology Group 91-11 trial (n = 547).13 Patients who undergo a laryngectomy often experience a difficult adjustment process. Even when the patient achieves a certain level of comfort with various techniques of artificial speech,27 the ability to communicate with others is hampered.26,28,29 Investigations have explored both the patient's and the interviewer's perceptions of the patient's difficulty with communication after laryngectomy.26 Of interest, the interviewers perceived the patients' impairment with communication as a much greater infringement on quality of life compared with the patients' perceptions. Patients who underwent laryngectomy believed that interference with social activities resulted in a greater detrimental effect regarding their quality of life compared with the interviewers' perception of this factor. Therefore, patients have their own perceptions, as well as the perceptions of others, as potential hurdles to normal activities after laryngectomy. The perception of life without a larynx plays an important role in a patient's treatment decision. In a recent trial from France, 269 patients were queried about the treatment choices they might make if they faced the diagnosis of advanced laryngeal cancer.30 Only 29% stated that they would not consider options with a lower chance of cure if told that the best option, with respect to survival, was total laryngectomy. However, their enthusiasm for seeking laryngeal-preserving options waned when told about potential adverse effects, such as tracheostomy or permanent gastrostomy. An older report31 of interviews with firefighters and executives who were asked to envision that they had advanced laryngeal cancer determined that they were willing to accept a 15% to 30% reduction in life expectancy for a laryngeal-preserving treatment compared with total laryngectomy. These studies30,31 demonstrate the importance of reviewing options and potential adverse effects with patients before making a decision regarding the best treatment. Considering the importance of laryngeal function, many head and neck cancer treatments have been directed toward the goal of laryngeal preservation. One of the largest randomized clinical trials was designed to evaluate laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, concomitant chemoradiotherapy, and induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy.13,14 Each treatment group included at least 180 patients, thus providing much greater statistical power than the current communication. The use of concomitant cisplatin and radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant improvement in laryngeal preservation compared with radiotherapy alone, with a hazard ratio of 0.46. However, the induction regimen of cisplatin and fluorouracil did not improve laryngeal preservation over radiotherapy alone. Neither concomitant chemoradiotherapy nor induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy resulted in improved overall survival compared with radiotherapy alone. Furthermore, there were greater severe acute toxic effects from the chemoradiotherapy treatments compared with radiotherapy alone,13 but no significant differences in severe late toxic effects were noted in the comparison of the 3 treatment arms.14 Unfortunately, the concomitant chemoradiotherapy arm had an increase in deaths not attributable to cancer compared with the other 2 arms; this finding needs to be explored further to determine whether undetected fatal late treatment toxic effects are greater with concomitant regimens. Although induction chemotherapy was not used in this trial, it has been the subject of many past and recent assessments involving laryngeal preservation, as well as other efficacy and safety outcomes.10-14 A retrospective review32 of the phase 3 TAX 324 trial (Induction Chemotherapy Comparing Taxotere Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil With Standard Cisplatin and 5-Fluorouracil Followed by Chemoradiation in Locally Advanced Head and Neck Cancer) in patients with laryngeal or hypopharyngeal cancers revealed that induction chemotherapy of docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (n = 90) compared with cisplatin plus fluorouracil (n = 76) followed by chemoradiotherapy with weekly carboplatin resulted in significantly improved overall survival (P = .02) and progression-free survival (P = .03) for the docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil group. Among patients undergoing surgery, laryngectomy-free survival was also significantly greater with docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil (P = .03). The TREMPLIN (Radiotherapy With Cisplatin Versus Radiotherapy With Cetuximab After Induction Chemotherapy for Larynx Preservation) trial compared the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy using docetaxel, cisplatin, and fluorouracil, followed by chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin (n = 60) or cetuximab (n = 56), for laryngeal preservation.33 No differences were found in laryngeal preservation, laryngeal function preservation, or overall survival between the 2 regimens. Newer studies, such as DeCIDE (Docetaxel-Based Chemotherapy Plus or Minus IC to Decrease Events in Head and Neck Cancer)34 and PARADIGM (Combination Chemotherapy and Radiation in Treating Patients With Stage III or IV Head and Neck Cancer),35 suggest no overall benefit from the addition of induction chemotherapy vs concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone. Conclusions The higher rate of laryngeal preservation that was achieved with the use of CRT compared with radiotherapy alone was encouraging. Furthermore, no significant increases in the most debilitating radiotherapy-induced toxic effects, such as mucositis/stomatitis and dysphagia, were observed. This treatment approach warrants further evaluation in larger populations to fully assess the potential value of cetuximab or other molecular targeting agents to augment laryngeal preservation rates.

"Post-operative cognitive dysfunction (POCD), a condition mostly observed in older patients following surgery under general anesthesia, is characterized by impaired memory and concentration. The impairment may be temporary or permanent and incapacitating. The problem has become more frequent as the population ages and also as a growing number of older adults undergo surgical procedures made possible by more advanced medical technology. Data from the scientific literature suggest a rise in mortality from POCD in the first year after surgery under general anesthesia. The good news, according to a Brazilian study published by the journal PLoS One, is that two relatively simple measures can help to reduce the incidence of POCD: administering a small dose of the anti-inflammatory drug dexamethasone immediately before an operation and avoiding profound anesthesia during the operation. Opinions on the adequate depth of anesthesia and the risks of very profound anesthesia currently diverge. Excessively superficial anesthesia is known to incur a risk of patient recall of the procedure, which is undesirable. ""Our findings confirm recent evidence that the deeper the anesthesia-induced hypnosis, the higher the incidence of POCD. The literature points to a link with the systemic inflammatory response induced by surgical trauma, damaging the central nervous system. If so, the use of an anti-inflammatory drug may have a protective effect,"" said Maria José Carvalho Carmona, a professor of anesthesiology at the University of São Paulo's Medical School (FM-USP) and principal investigator for the study. The researchers evaluated 140 patients aged between 60 and 87 who underwent surgery under propofol-induced general anesthesia at the Central Institute of Hospital das Clínicas, FM-USP's teaching hospital, in most cases for removal of gallstones. Pre-operative assessment included a battery of tests to measure mental and cognitive status. Patients who failed to achieve a cutoff score were excluded. The remaining subjects were divided randomly into four groups. In the operating room, deep anesthesia typical of major surgical procedures was induced in the first and third groups, and more superficial anesthesia in the second and fourth. Only the third and fourth groups received dexamethasone. The depth of anesthesia was monitored using bispectral index (BIS) technology, which processes electroencephalogram signals to measure drug-induced unconsciousness. The researchers classified a BIS of 35-45 as deep anesthesia and a BIS of 46-55 as superficial anesthesia. In the fourth group (superficial anesthesia with dexamethasone), the incidence of POCD was 15.3% immediately after surgery, but after six months the pre-operative cognitive status was restored in all patients. ""The results reinforce recent evidence of the importance of avoiding deep anesthesia,"" Carmona said. ""With regard to the use of dexamethasone, more research is needed to confirm our finding, preferably in multicenter trials, but there are strong indications that it can be beneficial in many cases."" The earliest trials with patients who developed POCD were performed after the 1950s. Before that, older patients were rarely subjected to major surgery, and significant research in this field has only been conducted for approximately 15-20 years. ""The causes of and risk factors for POCD are still being discussed,"" she said. ""Little is said about rehabilitation or ways of helping patients recover pre-operative cognitive function."" One of the obstacles to reliable diagnosis and rehabilitation is a lack of practical and secure instruments for pre- and post-operative cognitive assessment. ""The tests available today are either too time consuming or quick but unreliable,"" Carmona said. ""This makes it hard to follow up on patients."" ###",0,news_reviews_00403
"EAST HANOVER, N.J., June 22, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- A new analysis published today in JAMA Cardiology has found that timely and broad adoption of Entresto® (sacubitril/valsartan) by all eligible heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF) could prevent or postpone more than 28,000 deaths each year in the US alone.1 This analysis, based on an application of the results of PARADIGM-HF to published heart failure statistics, is the first to quantify the possible impact of Entresto's potential benefit in reducing death.1 Heart failure is a chronic condition that contributes to more than 300,000 deaths in the US every year.4 About half of people with heart failure have HFrEF.5 This new analysis estimates that as many as 28,484 deaths in HFrEF patients annually could be prevented or postponed with optimal use of Entresto (with sensitivity analyses demonstrating a range of 18,230 to 41,017).1 Further, the study suggests that delaying routine use of Entresto in clinical practice could have a substantial negative effect on patients, given the expected risk-benefit profile, as it could result in failure to prevent tens of thousands of deaths.1 These findings demonstrate the significant survival benefits Entresto could offer to those living with HFrEF, if patients in the group defined by the authors were given access to treatment.1 The study authors stated that nearly 84% of HFrEF patients – 2.2 million people – may be candidates for treatment with Entresto.1 Heart failure is a life-threatening condition and despite available medicines, about half of patients diagnosed with heart failure die within 5 years.4,6,7 According to the study authors, these findings may substantially impact the national health of the HFrEF population, offering significant clinical benefit in preventing or postponing death when applied in clinical practice.1 ""This expert analysis adds to the already compelling case for the treatment of heart failure patients with reduced ejection fraction with Entresto,"" said Fabrice Chouraqui, president of Novartis Pharmaceuticals Corporation. ""In addition to survival benefits, the study also recognizes other treatment effects of Entresto, particularly in reducing HF hospitalizations.1 Coupled with the recent Class I recommendation, the strongest endorsement, in the focused update to the US HF Guideline,2 these findings underscore the potential of Entresto as a standard therapy for chronic HFrEF patients."" In a separate analysis published in the same issue of JAMA Cardiology, researchers used data from the PARADIGM-HF trial to model the health consequences and cost-effectiveness of Entresto over a 30-year time period.3 They compared Entresto to the ACE-inhibitor enalapril and found Entresto was associated with more than a year longer average survival time, and that it was cost-effective compared to enalapril when these medications were used with other standard of care therapies.3 For every 1,000 patients treated with Entresto vs. enalapril, potentially 59.7 HF hospital admissions could be averted per each year alive in the model.3 In addition, Entresto increased life expectancy at an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio consistent with other high-value widely accepted cardiovascular interventions such as implantable cardioverter defibrillators (ICDs) and cholesterol-lowering statins before they became generic.3 About Heart Failure Heart failure is a debilitating and life-threatening condition, which impacts nearly 6 million Americans and is the leading cause of hospitalization among Americans over the age of 65.4,8 About half of people with heart failure have heart failure with reduced ejection fraction (HFrEF).5 Reduced ejection fraction means the heart does not contract with enough force, so less blood is pumped out.9 Heart failure presents a major and growing health-economic burden that currently exceeds $30 billion in the United States, which accounts for both direct and indirect costs.10 About Entresto Entresto is a twice-a-day medicine that reduces the strain on the failing heart. It does this by enhancing the protective neurohormonal systems (Natriuretic Peptide system) while simultaneously inhibiting the harmful effects of the overactive renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS).11 Other heart failure medicines only block the harmful effects of the overactive RAAS.12 Entresto contains the neprilysin inhibitor sacubitril, and the angiotensin receptor blocker (ARB) valsartan.11 Entresto is indicated in the US to reduce the risk of cardiovascular death and hospitalization for heart failure in patients with chronic heart failure (NYHA Class II-IV) and reduced ejection fraction.11 Entresto is usually administered in conjunction with other heart failure therapies, in place of an Angiotensin Converting Enzyme (ACE) inhibitor or an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB).11 Entresto film-coated tablets are available in three dosage strengths: 24/26 mg, 49/51 mg, and 97/103 mg (sacubitril/valsartan).11 These doses are referred to as 50 mg, 100 mg, and 200 mg in the clinical trial literature including the New England Journal of Medicine publication of the results of PARADIGM-HF. The target treatment dose of Entresto is 97/103 mg twice daily.11 Novartis is committed to providing patients with affordable access and resources through Entresto Central.

"New Haven, Conn.-- A new study by a Yale researcher may support the use of a device for patients suffering from irregular heart rhythms. The Watchman is a catheter-delivered device that is permanently implanted in the opening of the left atrial appendage (LAA), a small appendage of tissue that projects off one of the upper chambers of the heart. When patients are in an abnormal irregular heart rhythm called atrial fibrillation, blood clots can form in the LAA, which can then circulate out through the bloodstream and cause stroke. Once the device is in place in the opening of the LAA, a thin layer of tissue grows over it, preventing blood clots from forming in the LAA and therefore preventing stroke. It has been suggested that as treatment for atrial fibrillation, the Watchman device may be preferable to standard blood thinning medications, such as warfarin, which raise the risk of bleeding. To assess the cost-effectiveness of the device versus medication, the researchers developed a statistical model based on data from two key research trials, known as PROTECT AF and PREVAIL. The researchers found that while results from the trials varied, the device did appear to be more cost-effective in the larger, longer-term trial. ""What we know is that the PROTECT AF trial enrolled more patients and has longer follow-up at this time and this allows greater statistical certainty,"" said Dr. James Freeman, assistant professor of cardiology and first author on the paper. ""Based on that, the study may provide more certainty in terms of cost-effectiveness."" However, longer-term results are needed to be completely certain of the device's value in clinical practice, he said. The study published online May 16 in Circulation: Arrhythmia and Electrophysiology. ###",1,news_reviews_00406
"Australian researchers have discovered that an existing medication could have promise in preventing breast cancer in women carrying a faulty BRCA1 gene. People who carry a faulty BRCA1 gene are at high risk of developing aggressive breast cancer. Currently many women with a gene mutation choose surgical removal of their breast tissue and ovaries to reduce their chance of developing breast and ovarian cancer. By pinpointing the cells that give rise to breast cancers in women who have inherited a faulty version of the BRCA1 gene, Walter and Eliza Hall Institute researchers have identified that the drug denosumab may have potential to prevent breast cancer from developing. If confirmed in clinical studies, this would provide a non-surgical option to prevent breast cancer in women with elevated genetic risk. Using samples of breast tissue donated by women carrying a faulty BRCA1 gene, Ms Emma Nolan, Professor Jane Visvader and Professor Geoff Lindeman were able to pinpoint the cells that give rise to breast cancer. The research, which also involved researchers at the Australian familial cancer consortium kConFab and US biotechnology company Amgen was published today in Nature Medicine. Cancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue had many similarities to aggressive forms of breast cancer, said Ms Nolan, who is a PhD student at the institute enrolled through The University of Melbourne's Department of Medical Biology. ""These cells proliferated rapidly, and were susceptible to damage to their DNA - both factors that help them transition towards cancer,"" she said. ""We were excited to discover that these pre-cancerous cells could be identified by a marker protein called RANK."" Professor Lindeman, who is also a medical oncologist at The Royal Melbourne Hospital, said the discovery of RANK as a marker of cancer precursors was an important breakthrough, because inhibitors of the RANK signalling pathway were already in clinical use. ""An inhibitor called denosumab is already used in the clinic to treat osteoporosis and breast cancer that has spread to the bone,"" he said. ""We therefore investigated what effect RANK inhibition had on the cancer precursor cells in BRCA1-mutant breast tissue."" The research team showed that RANK inhibition switched off cell growth in breast tissue from women with a faulty BRCA1 gene and curtailed breast cancer development in laboratory models. ""We think this strategy could delay or prevent breast cancer in women with an inherited BRCA1 gene mutation,"" Professor Lindeman said. ""A clinical trial has already begun to investigate this further."" ""This is potentially a very important discovery for women who carry a faulty BRCA1 gene, who have few other options. Current cancer prevention strategies for these women include surgical removal of the breasts and/or ovaries, which can have serious impacts on people's lives. To progress this work, denosumab would need to be formally tested in clinical trials in this setting as it is not approved for breast cancer prevention,"" Professor Lindeman said. Professor Visvader said the discovery had its basis in more than a decade of investigations of breast stem cell function. ""By thoroughly dissecting how normal breast tissue develops, we have been able to pinpoint the precise cells that are the culprits in cancer formation,"" she said. ""It is very exciting to think that we may be on the path to the 'holy grail' of cancer research, devising a way to prevent this type of breast cancer in women at high genetic risk."" The research team worked closely with Mrs Avis Macphee, a patient advocate, through the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute's consumer-researcher buddy system. The research was supported by The National Breast Cancer Foundation, The Qualtrough Cancer Research Fund, The Joan Marshall Breast Cancer Research Fund, the Australian Cancer Research Foundation, Cancer Council Victoria, the Cancer Therapeutics Cooperative Research Centre, an Amgen Preclinical Research Program Grant, the National Health and Medical Research Council, the Victorian Cancer Agency, and the Victorian Government Operational Infrastructure Support Scheme. ### The Walter and Eliza Hall Institute is the research powerhouse of the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre, an alliance of leading Victorian hospitals and research centres committed to controlling cancer.",0,news_reviews_00408
"JUNE 9, 2016 - OTTAWA, CANADA - A clinical trial published in The Lancet, a top medical journal, shows that an intensive procedure that completely wipes out the immune system and then regenerates a new one using blood stem cells can eliminate all signs of damaging brain inflammation in people with early, aggressive multiple sclerosis (MS), and facilitate lasting recovery. Led by Dr. Harold Atkins and Dr. Mark S. Freedman of The Ottawa Hospital and the University of Ottawa, the trial included 24 participants who were followed for up to 13 years. The $6.47 million trial was funded by the MS Society of Canada and its affiliated Multiple Sclerosis Scientific Research Foundation. The research was also supported by The Ottawa Hospital Foundation, The Ottawa Hospital Department of Medicine and Canadian Blood Services. ""Our trial is the first to show the complete, long-term suppression of all inflammatory activity in people with MS,"" said Dr. Atkins, a stem cell transplant physician and scientist at The Ottawa Hospital, and associate professor at the University of Ottawa. ""This is very exciting. However, it is important to note that this therapy can have serious side effects and risks, and would only be appropriate for a small proportion of people with very active MS. People with MS who have had significant disability for a long time would likely not benefit."" ""This procedure should be considered as a treatment option for people with early, aggressive MS,"" said Dr. Freedman, a neurologist and senior scientist at The Ottawa Hospital and professor at the University of Ottawa. ""Although this trial was relatively small, it was intensive, with the longest prospective follow-up of any such treatment group to date, and that is what makes the results so convincing. However, this is a very complex procedure that should only be performed at very specialized centres with expertise in both the management of MS patients and blood stem cell transplantation."" MS affects approximately 2.3 million people around the world, causing symptoms that range from blurred vision to extreme fatigue to partial or complete paralysis. It occurs when the immune system - which normally protects against foreign disease-causing organisms - mistakenly attacks the body's own central nervous system, which includes the brain, spinal cord and optic nerve. Early in the disease, people often experience temporary episodes of worsening symptoms accompanied by active inflammation in the brain (called relapses), whereas later on, disease progression is inevitable. The trial evaluated a treatment called immunoablation and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (IAHSCT). The procedure begins by giving a person medication to coax their hematopoietic stem cells to migrate from their bone marrow into their blood. These stem cells are then collected from the blood, purified and frozen. Then, high doses of chemotherapy drugs are used to eliminate the person's diseased immune system. The stem cells are then transplanted back into the same person, so that they can give rise to a new immune system that has no ""memory"" of the previous pattern of attacking the central nervous system. The trial included 24 participants with aggressive, relapsing MS. They were followed for anywhere between four and 13 years after treatment (with a median post-treatment follow up of 6.7 years). After the treatment: Not a single participant experienced a clinical relapse (zero relapses in 179 patient-years), whereas before treatment, the participants experienced an average of 1.2 relapses per year (167 relapses in 146 patient-years). Not a single new active inflammatory lesion could be detected in the brains of any of the participants (zero lesions on 327 MRI scans) whereas before the treatment, participants had 188 lesions on 48 scans. Not a single participant required MS-specific drugs to control their disease. 70 percent of participants experienced a complete stop in disease progression. The average rate of brain shrinkage, typically a measure that correlates with MS progression, returned to levels associated with normal aging. 40 percent of participants experienced some lasting reversal of symptoms such as vision loss, muscle weakness and balance problems.",0,news_reviews_00409
"Newswise — MAYWOOD, IL – Although surgery can prolong the lives of patients with an aggressive type of cancer called malignant pleural mesothelioma, many patients avoid the operation for fear it will degrade their quality of life. But a study led by a Loyola Medicine thoracic surgeon has found just the opposite: Patients who underwent an operation called pleurectomy and decortication (PD) generally reported their quality of life improved after surgery. Wickii Vigneswaran, MD, presented the study during the 2016 annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Dr. Vigneswaran is division director of thoracic surgery and a professor in the department of thoracic and cardiovascular surgery of Loyola University Chicago Stritch School of Medicine. Malignant pleural mesothelioma is caused by environmental factors such as exposure to asbestos as well as a genetic predisposition to the cancer. It develops in the pleura, the thin layer of tissue surrounding the lungs. As the tumor grows, it restricts the lungs, typically causing shortness of breath, fatigue, weight loss and/or chest discomfort and pain. In PD surgery, the pleura is removed. While the procedure cannot cure mesothelioma, it can help control the buildup of fluid, improve breathing and lessen cancer pain. Dr. Vigneswaran and colleagues administered a cancer quality-of-life survey known as the EORTC QLQ-C30 to 114 mesothelioma patients who underwent PD surgery. The median age was 70, with a range of 50 to 88. Prior to surgery, 31 percent of the patients had a performance status score of 0 (fully functional); 65 percent had a performance status score of 1 (able to do light house work or office work); and 4 percent had a performance status of 2 (ambulatory and capable of self-care, but unable to work). Following surgery, all patients were surveyed at 1 month, 4-5 months, 7-8 months and 10-11 months. The quality of life survey measured overall functioning (physical, emotional, cognitive, etc.); general symptoms (fatigue, nausea/vomiting and pain); individual items (shortness of breath, diarrhea, insomnia, constipation and financial difficulties) and overall health. Improved quality of life was observed in the first month after surgery and was maintained at late follow-up in all patients. Quality of life was not adversely affected by surgery at any time in patients who, prior to surgery, had performance status of 1 or 2; a tumor volume greater than 600 ml. or a type of tumor cell called non-epithelioid. ""The net benefit of pleurectomy and decortication justifies the procedure in the majority of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma,"" Dr. Vigneswaran concluded. The study is titled ""Quality of Life in Patients Undergoing Pleurectomy and Decortication for Malignant Pleural Mesothelioma."" The surgeries were performed by Dr. Vigneswaran at University of Chicago Medicine, where he practiced before recently joining Loyola.",0,news_reviews_00413
"Bottom Line: The investigational anticancer therapeutic abemaciclib, which targets CDK4 and CDK6, showed durable clinical activity when given as continuous single-agent therapy to patients with a variety of cancer types, including breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), glioblastoma, and melanoma, according to results from a phase I clinical trial. Journal in Which the Study was Published: Cancer Discovery, a journal of the American Association for Cancer Research. Senior authors: Amita Patnaik, MD, associate director of clinical research at South Texas Accelerated Research Therapeutics in San Antonio, Texas, and Geoffrey I. Shapiro, MD, PhD, director of the Early Drug Development Center at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston. Background: In February 2015, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved the CDK4/6 inhibitor palbociclib (Ibrance) for use in combination with the aromatase inhibitor letrozole for treating postmenopausal women with estrogen receptor-positive, HER2-negative advanced breast cancer. The oral CDK4/6 inhibitor abemaciclib is a very different molecule from palbociclib, with distinct attributes that contribute to its discrete therapeutic effects, in particular, its single-agent activity, according to Shapiro. For example, abemaciclib has greater selectivity for CDK4 compared with palbociclib, which may explain why it does not affect white blood cell counts as severely, allowing it to be taken on a continuous schedule without treatment holidays, he said. Abemaciclib also penetrates the central nervous system, whereas palbociclib does not, raising the possibility that it could be used to treat primary or metastatic brain tumors, he added. How the Study Was Conducted and Results: Patnaik, Shapiro, and colleagues enrolled 225 patients with a variety of types of advanced cancer in the phase I clinical trial designed to evaluate the safety and preliminary efficacy of abemaciclib. In the dose escalation phase, the researchers determined that the maximum tolerated dose was 200 milligrams (mg) every 12 hours; the dose-limiting toxicity was grade 3 fatigue. In the expansion phase, single-agent abemaciclib was administered to 47 patients with breast cancer, 68 with NSCLC, 17 with glioblastoma, 26 with melanoma, and 15 with colorectal cancer. Among these patients, the most common treatment-related adverse events were fatigue, diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, anorexia, weight loss, kidney dysfunction, and decreased red and white blood cell counts. Radiographic responses were observed for some patients with breast cancer, NSCLC, and melanoma. Among the 36 patients with hormone receptor-positive breast cancer, 11 had a partial response, with four of the 11 responders having continued prior endocrine therapy, and an additional 18 patients had stable disease. Among the 68 patients with NSCLC, two had a partial response and 31 had stable disease; one patient who had a partial response and 12 who had stable disease were known to have KRAS-mutant NSCLC. Among the 26 patients with melanoma, one had a partial response and six had stable disease. Three of the 17 patients with glioblastoma had stable disease, with two of them continuing to receive treatment without disease progression for 19 and 23 cycles, respectively. Author Comment: ""These data show that abemaciclib is an oral drug that can be taken on a continuous schedule and achieve durable clinical activity against multiple tumors including breast and lung cancers,"" said Shapiro. ""The results of the trial supported the FDA decision to grant breakthrough therapy designation to abemaciclib (previously known as LY2835219) for patients with refractory hormone receptor-positive advanced or metastatic breast cancer,"" added Patnaik. Limitations: Patnaik explained that because this study included 225 patients with different types of cancer, confirmatory clinical trials in specific patient populations are necessary to precisely define the role of abemaciclib in cancer care. Multiple clinical trials have already been initiated to evaluate abemaciclib as a treatment for certain groups of patients with breast cancer and NSCLC, as well as children with primary brain tumors and adults with brain metastases, she noted. ### Funding & Disclosures: The study was funded by Eli Lilly and Company. Patnaik has received research funding from Lilly. Shapiro served on an advisory board for Lilly during the conduct of the study; reports receiving personal fees from Lilly, GI Therapeutics, Vertex Pharmaceuticals, and grants from Lilly for work other than reported here; and is an investigator on several trials using other CDK4/6 inhibitors, including palbociclib and ribociclib.

"DALLAS - April 18, 2016 - A five-year study shows that Stereotactic Body Radiation Therapy (SBRT) to treat prostate cancer offers a higher cure rate than more traditional approaches, according to researchers at UT Southwestern Medical Center Harold C. Simmons Comprehensive Cancer Center. The study - the first trial to publish five-year results from SBRT treatment for prostate cancer - found a 98.6 percent cure rate with SBRT, a noninvasive form of radiation treatment that involves high-dose radiation beams entering the body through various angles and intersecting at the desired target. It is a state-of-the-art technology that allows for a concentrated dose to reach the tumor while limiting the radiation dose to surrounding healthy tissue. ""The high cure rate is striking when compared to the reported five-year cure rates from other approaches like surgery or conventional radiation, which range between 80 to 90 percent, while the side effects of this treatment are comparable to other types of treatment,"" said Dr. Raquibul Hannan, Assistant Professor of Radiation Oncology and lead author for the study. ""What we now have is a more potent and effective form of completely noninvasive treatment for prostate cancer, conveniently completed in five treatments."" Conventional treatment options for early stage prostate cancer include: Prostatectomy, the surgical removal of the prostate gland, which can be done with minimally invasive techniques and robotic assistance; Brachytherapy, in which doctors implant numerous small radioactive seeds about the size of a grain of rice into the prostate gland using multiple large needles inserted through the skin in the operating room. Once implanted, the seeds release their radioactivity directly into the prostate gland; and External beam radiation, which involves 42 to 45 treatments administered over two or more months, five days a week. ""The current form of radiation is 44 treatments given over nine weeks. In contrast, the SBRT therapy we used allows the delivery of highly focused radiation in only five treatments, allowing patients to return to their normal lives more quickly,"" said senior author Dr. Robert Timmerman, Director of the Annette Simmons Stereotactic Treatment Center at UT Southwestern, and Professor and Vice Chairman of the Department of Radiation Oncology. ""SBRT is both more convenient and has increased potency."" UT Southwestern served as the lead site for the multi-institutional clinical trial, which involved first-time prostate cancer patients diagnosed with stage I or stage II (low and intermediate risk) prostate cancer. A total of 91 patients were treated prospectively and followed for five years, with only one patient experiencing a recurrence of his cancer. The findings are published in the European Journal of Cancer. Terry Martin of McKinney, Texas, - about an hour outside Dallas - said the fewer number of treatments was a compelling advantage when he was evaluating treatment options. ""I live 45 minutes away from UT Southwestern. The difference between being treated five times versus 44 times is enormous,"" said Mr. Martin, a retired airline pilot. ""I felt that I was back to normal just 10 days after finishing treatment."" In addition to shorter treatment times, researchers found that side effects were not necessarily different compared to other forms of prostate cancer treatment. In the short term, the side effects of SBRT can include urinary issues (urgency, frequency and burning) and rectal irritation, which are often temporary and reverse within four weeks of treatment. Researchers found a small risk of longer-term urinary and rectal complications, which is also comparable to conventional treatments. Decrease in erectile function was seen in 25 percent of patients, fewer than with conventional radiation or surgery, said Dr. Hannan. To reduce the side effects associated with SBRT, current clinical trials at UTSW are using a unique and biodegradable rectal spacer gel to protect the rectum. UTSW is currently the only accredited site in Texas at which this spacer gel can be used. Other clinical trials at the UTSW Department of Radiation Oncology are seeking to expand the application of SBRT to high-risk (Stage III) prostate cancer patients. ""Our hope is that the high potency of this form of treatment will significantly improve treatment of these patients,"" says Dr. Hannan, the principal investigator of the high-risk prostate SBRT trial. UT Southwestern has been a leader in pioneering use of SBRT.

"LEXINGTON, Massachusetts, April 4, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- • Study addresses key U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) requirement, keeping SHP465 on track for potential 2017 U.S. launch • Topline data revealed SHP465 met primary endpoint, showing ADHD symptom improvement in children and adolescents (p<0.001) • Key secondary endpoint also met, showing higher proportion of patients were rated improved (p<0.001) • Data add to overall robust clinical development program for SHP465 Shire plc (LSE: SHP,NASDAQ: SHPG) today announces positive topline results from a four-week Phase 3, randomized, double-blind, multi-center, placebo-controlled, dose-optimization, safety and efficacy study, SHP465-305, in children and adolescents aged 6-17 years with Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD). SHP465 (triple-bead mixed amphetamine salts - MAS) is an investigational oral stimulant medication being evaluated in the U.S. as a potential treatment for ADHD, a therapeutic area with significant need for additional treatment options. The primary efficacy analysis of study 305 demonstrated that SHP465, administered as a daily morning dose, was superior to placebo on the change from baseline in ADHD-RS-IV (ADHD rating scale) total score, with a Least Squares (LS) mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -9.9 (95% CI: -13.0 to -6.8, p<0.001), suggesting a significant improvement in ADHD symptoms. SHP465 was also superior to placebo in the key secondary efficacy analysis on the clinical global impression improvement scale (CGI-I), with an LS mean difference from placebo at Week 4 of -0.8 (95% CI: -1.1 to -0.5, p<0.001), indicating a significantly higher proportion of patients were rated improved on the CGI-I rating scale. The CGI-I is a standardized assessment tool that allows clinicians to rate the severity of ADHD illness, change over time and efficacy of medication. Treatment-emergent adverse events ≥ 5% for SHP 465-305 were decreased appetite, headache, insomnia, irritability, nausea, weight decrease and dizziness. Adverse events were generally mild to moderate in severity and similar to those observed in previous SHP465 studies and with other amphetamine compounds. The completion of SHP465-305 addresses an FDA requirement to evaluate the safety and efficacy of SHP465 in children and adolescents prior to filing a Class 2 resubmission of the medicine for FDA approval. ""We are pleased with the positive results of the SHP465-305 study,"" said Philip J. Vickers, Ph.D., Head of Research & Development, Shire. ""These results represent an important step toward a new treatment option for patients with ADHD. Shire looks forward to including these data as part of the FDA resubmission and is eager to continue advancing this clinical program."" Dr. Matthew Brams, M.D., Clinical Assistant Professor at Baylor College of Medicine and principal investigator for study 305, added: ""The study of SHP465 in children and adolescents is an essential next step to progressing the clinical program. I'm excited about these positive data from SHP465-305 because of the benefit that this potential new treatment option may provide for patients with ADHD."" Overall Robust SHP465 Clinical Development Program to Support Class 2 Resubmission Including study 305 and previous studies, Shire now has a robust database of 15 clinical studies evaluating SHP465 in more than 1,100 subjects. Once the pharmacokinetic study and an additional safety and efficacy Phase 3 trial in adults currently under way are complete later this year, Shire plans to add these study results to its existing SHP465 data set to submit a Class 2 resubmission for FDA approval of the medicine for treatment of ADHD. SHP465 remains on track for potential U.S. launch in the second half of 2017. In previous adolescent and adult clinical studies, SHP465 demonstrated a statistically significant difference versus placebo at 16 hours post dosing, with onset of action starting 4 hours post dosing, as measured by the Permanent Product Measure of Performance (PERMP). PERMP was not measured in the SHP465-305 study. Protection for Shire's ADHD Franchise Extends to 2029 There are patents supporting Shire's overall ADHD franchise in the U.S. that extend to 2029. With a launch planned for the second half of 2017, Shire expects that SHP465, following potential FDA approval, will have three years of Hatch-Waxman exclusivity and at least three patents listed in the FDA Orange Book expiring as late as May 2029.

"Press Release For Immediate Release: Thursday, March 24, 2016 Contact: Media Relations (404) 639-3286 The latest outcomes measuring the impact of CDC's national tobacco education campaign are as strong as those achieved in its first year, and suggest that three years into the campaign, the ads were still having a significant impact. More than 1.8 million smokers attempted to quit smoking because of the nine-week-long 2014 Tips From Former Smokers ( Tips ) campaign. An estimated 104,000 Americans quit smoking for good as a result of the 2014 campaign. The survey results are published in the March 24 release of the journal Preventing Chronic Disease. Unlike the 2012 campaign, which aired for 12 consecutive weeks, the 2014 campaign aired in two phases, from February 3 to April 6 and from July 7 to September 7. Phase 1 of the 2014 campaign ran ads primarily from the 2012 and 2013 campaigns; Phase 2 contained new ads. Those new ads featured people and their struggles with smoking-related health issues, including cancer, gum disease, premature birth, and stroke caused by smoking combined with HIV. About 80 percent of U.S. adult cigarette smokers who were surveyed reported seeing at least one television ad from Phase 2 of the 2014 campaign. ""CDC's Tips campaign has helped at least 400,000 smokers quit smoking for good since 2012,"" said CDC Director Tom Frieden, M.D., M.P.H. ""Tips is also extremely cost-effective and a best buy, saving both lives and money. With a year-round campaign we could save even more lives and money."" Tips, the first federally funded anti-smoking paid media campaign, features former smokers talking about their smoking-related illnesses. Smoking-related diseases cost the United States more than $300 billion a year, including nearly $170 billion in direct health care costs and more than $156 billion in lost productivity. ""The Tips campaign is an important counter measure to the $1 million that the tobacco industry spends each hour on cigarette advertising and promotion,"" said Corinne Graffunder, Dr.P.H., director of CDC's Office on Smoking and Health. ""The money spent in one year on Tips is less than the amount the tobacco industry spends on advertising and promotion in just 3 days."" The most recent Surgeon General's Report, The Health Consequences of Smoking—50 Years of Progress, called for airing effective messages such as the Tips ads with high frequency and exposure for 12 months a year for a decade or more. Cigarette smoking is the leading preventable cause of disease and death in the United States, killing about 480,000 Americans each year. For every American who dies from a smoking-related disease, about 30 more suffer at least one serious illness from smoking. And while the percentage of American adults who smoke is at the lowest level since the CDC began tracking such data, there are still an estimated 40 million adult smokers in the U.S. Surveys show about 70 percent of all smokers want to quit, and research shows quitting completely at any age has significant health benefits. Tips ads encourage smokers to call 1-800-QUIT-NOW or to visit www.cdc.gov/tips to view the personal stories from the campaign. The website includes detailed assistance developed by the National Cancer Institute to support smokers trying to quit.

"Critically ill children are artificially fed soon after their arrival in intensive care. This common practice is based on the assumption that it will help them recover more quickly. An international study coordinated at KU Leuven, Belgium, has now disproven this theory. The study shows that receiving little to no nutrition during the first week in intensive care makes children recover faster. Critically ill children in intensive care are unable to eat independently. The current standard of care for such children is based mostly on the assumption that they need to eat to regain their strength. Therefore, the method that is applied worldwide is to artificially feed these children during the first days of their stay in intensive care. This artificial nutrition is meant to strengthen their muscles, prevent complications, and speed up their recovery. The artificial nutrition is infused directly into the bloodstream. An international team of researchers from University Hospitals Leuven (Belgium), Sophia Children's Hospital Rotterdam (The Netherlands), and Stollery Children's Hospital Edmonton (Canada) has now challenged the validity of this common practice. They conducted a randomized controlled trial that involved 1,440 critically ill children. The researchers examined whether fasting or receiving very small amounts of feeding during the first week in the paediatric intensive care unit was better for the children than full feeding through an IV. The results are remarkable. ""We found that the current practice of feeding children in an early stage does not contribute to their recovery"", says lead author Professor Greet Van den Berghe from KU Leuven / University Hospitals Leuven. ""On the contrary, the children who had built up a nutritional deficiency after receiving little to no feedings had fewer infections, less organ failure, and a quicker recovery than children who had been fed through the IV. The effect was present in everyone, regardless of the type of disease, the children's age, or the hospital in which they were staying."" These findings provide strong evidence against current practice and can thus be expected to change paediatric intensive care worldwide. Previous research by Professor Van den Berghe and her team (2011 and 2014) had already shown that early artificial feeding should be avoided to treat adults in intensive care. ###",0,news_reviews_00462
"ATHENS, Greece, March 10, 2016 /PRNewswire/ -- Topline-results of the first randomised clinical trial in the world to investigate the effects of a nutritional intervention in very early AD (pre-dementia) [1] Topline results from the European LipiDiDiet clinical trial were presented today as part of a late-breaking presentation at the Advances in Alzheimer's Therapy (AAT) congress. They showed that in people with very early AD (pre-dementia), a once-daily nutritional drink* designated a ""food for special medical purposes"" can help to reduce brain shrinkage - particularly in the hippocampal brain area, the part of the brain that helps store short-term memories for long-term retrieval. And for those who start the intervention early and consumed it regularly, it can help to conserve memory and the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. The drink contains ""Fortasyn Connect"", a specific combination of fatty acids, vitamins and other nutrients. This is the first time a randomised, double-blind, clinical trial has shown that a nutritional intervention can help to conserve the ability of patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) to carry out everyday tasks, such as paying bills, or finding your way around, as measured by the Clinical Dementia Rating-Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB) - a combined measure for the ability to think and perform everyday tasks. This is important because those with very early AD (pre-dementia) currently have no approved, available pharmacological options. The study did not find a significant benefit in broad cognitive function (the study primary endpoint). Cognitive decline over the study period was less than originally expected when it was designed ten years ago, so differences found between the two groups were too small to be statistically significant. Project coordinator Professor Tobias Hartmann, Saarland University Germany, explained that this is the most likely reason the primary endpoint was not met. Professor Hilkka Soininen, Professor in Neurology MD, PhD from the University of Eastern Finland, who headed the clinical trial as part of the LipiDiDiet project, said: ""Today's results are extremely valuable as they bring us closer to understanding the impact of nutritional interventions on very early AD (pre-dementia) which we are now better at diagnosing but unable to treat due to a lack of approved pharmaceutical options. The LipiDiDiet study illustrates that this nutritional intervention can help to conserve brain tissue and also memory and patients' ability to perform everyday tasks - possibly the most troubling aspects of the disease. We look forward to the results of subsequent analyses and the six year extension study which will provide further insights"". The clinical trial, headed by Professor Hilkka Soininen is part of a large EC project (LipiDiDiet) to explore the therapeutic and preventative impact of nutrition on neuronal and cognitive performance in ageing, AD and vascular dementia. LipiDiDiet is funded by the seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission (EC) and coordinated by Professor Hartmann, Saarland University in Germany. Fortasyn Connect was selected by a consortium of leading researchers from 19 European institutes, for this 24-month, randomised, controlled, double-blind, multicentre study involving 311 patients - on the basis of its results in a previous EU project (LipiDiet). Nearly 47 million people have Alzheimer's or a related dementia for which there is currently no cure.[2] This number is expected to double every 20 years, reaching 74.7 million in 2030 and 131.5 million in 2050.[2] Study details The trial was the first to investigate the impact of Fortasyn Connect on patients with very early AD (pre-dementia) who were randomised to receive either Fortasyn Connect or an iso-caloric control drink once daily. The primary outcome parameter was selected to assess the effect on cognitive function (a broad measure of thinking) during 24 months intake of Fortasyn Connect compared with a control product. This was a cognitive composite score consisting of the CERAD 10-word immediate recall, delayed recall and recognition, category fluency and letter digit substitution test. Secondary outcome parameters were brain volumes (total hippocampal, whole-brain & ventricular volumes), the Clinical Dementia Rating Sum of Boxes (CDR-SB), Neuropsychological Test Battery composite scores: episodic memory, executive function/working memory composite and a complete composite score consisting of 16 subtests, progression to (AD) dementia, blood and CSF biomarkers, tolerance and safety. No significant difference was observed for the cognitive composite score. Predefined analyses showed significant differences between active and control study groups for hippocampal and whole-brain atrophy, and favourable effects for CDR Sum of Boxes and episodic memory (both were most pronounced in patients with high baseline cognition with regular intake). Analyses are ongoing for progression to (AD) dementia and blood and CSF biomarkers. Tobias Hartmann, the project's coordinator, said, ""We have known for a while that diet can reduce the risk of developing dementia. Indeed, certain nutrients have been found to have a neuroprotective effect on the brain. However translating this into an effective intervention hasn't been easy because single nutrients simply aren't powerful enough to fight a disease like Alzheimer's alone. Today's clinical trial results have shown that the key is combining certain nutrients, in order to increase their effect. ""This is exciting because it shows that in the absence of effective drug options, we really have found something that can help slow down some of the most distressing symptoms in very early AD (pre-dementia); especially in those who started the intervention early. Indeed those patients who have lost the least cognitive function, have the most to gain."" Notes to editors* About LipiDiDiet LipiDiDiet is an innovative project whose remit is dementia prevention related research. The initiative benefits from funding provided by the 7th Framework Programme (FP7- 211696) of the European Commission, and follows on from previous projects in the field of dementia. The project's predecessor, LipiDiet, was incorporated within the 5th EU research programme in 2002. Since its establishment, evidence has been accumulated to support the hypothesis that certain nutritional molecules are beneficial in reducing disease progression in Alzheimer's. This stimulated further research which led to the birth of the LipiDiDiet project.

Its remit is twofold - the clinical and epidemiological assessment of the value of nutritional support in people at risk of developing AD, and to conduct basic research to better understand and improve the possible therapeutic and preventive effects of nutrition in AD and Vascular Dementia. The project's predecessor, LipiDiet, was incorporated within the 5th EU research programme in 2002. During its years of activity, preclinical and epidemiological evidence was accumulated to support the hypothesis that certain nutritional molecules could be beneficial in reducing disease progression in Alzheimer's. This stimulated further research which led to the birth of the LipiDiDiet project. About the European LipiDiDiet Study As part of the LipiDiDiet project, the first randomised clinical trial to investigate the effects of a medical food Fortasyn Connect (Souvenaid), in patients with very early AD (pre-dementia), has just been completed. The trial was funded by the seventh Framework Programme (FP7) of the European Commission (EC) and run by an independent consortium of 19 research partners throughout Europe. Professor Hilkka Soininen, Professor in Neurology MD, PhD from the University of Eastern Finland headed the clinical trial as part of the LipiDiDiet project. The study co-ordinator is Tobias Hartmann, Professor for Experimental Neurology at the Saarland University, Homburg, Germany. For more information on the LipiDiDiet research partners, please visit: http://www.lipididiet.eu/ For more information on the European Commission funded research projects, please visit: http://cordis.europa.eu/ European LipiDiDiet Study Rationale It is well known that diet has a significant impact on cognitive function and cognitive decline. However, whilst clinical trial results on single nutrient based interventions have been largely disappointing - epidemiological studies indicate that dietary patterns (e.g. Mediterranean or healthy Nordic Diet) are more effective in maintaining cognitive function and risk reduction than single nutrients. Extensive preclinical investigation, which took place as part the LipiDiDiet project, indicated that the nutrient combination in Fortasyn Connect has effects on multiple biological pathways that contribute to an overall neuroprotective effect. In addition, earlier randomised controlled trials (RCTs) with the product have shown an improved memory performance in drug-naïve mild AD patients, along with a good safety profile.

"Newswise — The breast surgery and reconstructive team at The Valley Hospital in Ridgewood, NJ, is taking the lead in providing new and progressive advances in breast cancer surgery. Valley was the first hospital in northern New Jersey where an innovative technique – called pre-pectoral placement of a tissue expander -- was utilized during breast reconstruction surgery following a mastectomy. The procedure results in diminished post-operative pain, quicker recovery time, improved mobility, and an excellent aesthetic outcome for patients. The technique has the potential to be a ""game-changer,"" says Tzvi Small, M.D., Director of the Department of Plastic and Reconstructive Surgery at The Valley Hospital, who performed the breast reconstruction procedure on Hasbrouck Heights resident Vanessa Burt, 43. ""This variation of a standard technique used during breast reconstruction will revolutionize the post-operative recovery in patients who meet certain criteria for the procedure,"" notes Dr. Small. ""Here at Valley, we are proud to offer this option for our patients and are excited about its potential for vastly improving patient care for women with breast cancer."" The technique involves placing tissue expanders (interim implants) under the skin on top of a woman's pectoralis muscles after her breast tissue has been removed. After a recovery period of approximately two months — during which the woman's chest skin heals, blood supply replenishes, and the expanders are gradually inflated to stretch the skin — the patient returns for an outpatient surgical procedure to replace the tissue expanders with permanent breast implants. In addition to exceptional cosmetic results, the technique is likely to improve clinical outcomes as evidenced by ongoing research that shows women who undergo this procedure experience less pain and a shorter recovery period. ""Over the past decade there have been dramatic improvements in breast reconstruction that utilize various types of surgical innovations, implants, and biologic tissue,"" notes Dr. Small. ""It is very rewarding as a reconstructive surgeon to continuously refine these procedures for our patients."" Ms. Burt chose the Valley breast surgery team after carefully researching her treatment options for DCIS (ductal carcinoma in situ), a diagnosis that is often debated among clinicians as to whether it should be classified as breast cancer at all. In DCIS, abnormal cells have not spread beyond the milk ducts into adjacent breast tissue or lymph nodes. After consulting with several breast surgeons and reconstructive surgeons, Ms. Burt opted for a nipple-sparing mastectomy performed by breast surgeon Tihesha Wilson, M.D., Assistant Medical Director of Valley's Breast Center. Immediately following in the operating room, Dr. Small performed the breast reconstruction. ""This was a long journey,"" says Ms. Burt, a publicist for the San Francisco-based Fat Wreck Chords music company. ""Dr. Wilson was more than patient with me as I first chose active surveillance for one year and then decided to undergo a double mastectomy when another area of DCIS was identified in November 2015. I am also grateful for Dr. Small's willingness to ‘look outside the box' and for his determination to perform my reconstruction in a way that would give me the best results with the least amount of recovery time. I want to also commend the pathologists at Valley, who were exceptional in their diagnostic results."" Dr. Wilson and Laura Klein, M.D., Medical Director of the Breast Center, have extensive experience in performing nipple-sparing mastectomy, a technically demanding surgery that is performed within aesthetically appealing minimally invasive incisions. With expertise in minimally invasive oncoplastic breast surgery, Dr. Wilson has also studied complementary medicine and provides her patients with a holistic, integrative approach to breast care. ""It's important to listen to each woman's needs and then to decide together what is the best approach to treatment, so that in the end the cancer will be gone and the woman can move on with her life,"" says Dr. Wilson. The Valley Breast Center provides comprehensive diagnostic, surgical, and support services using a multidisciplinary approach. The Breast Center is designated by the National Accreditation Program of Breast Centers, a program of the American Cancer Society. Valley's Breast Imaging Center has been named a Breast Imaging Center of Excellence by the American College of Radiology.",1,news_reviews_00470
"Eylea outperforms Avastin for diabetic macular edema with moderate or worse vision loss NIH-funded clinical trial shows Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis perform similarly when vision loss is mild. National Eye Institute A two-year clinical trial that compared three drugs for diabetic macular edema (DME) found that gains in vision were greater for participants receiving the drug Eylea (aflibercept) than for those receiving Avastin (bevacizumab), but only among participants starting treatment with 20/50 or worse vision. Gains after two years were about the same for Eylea and Lucentis (ranibizumab), contrary to year-one results from the study, which showed Eylea with a clear advantage. The three drugs yielded similar gains in vision for patients with 20/32 or 20/40 vision at the start of treatment. The clinical trial was conducted by the Diabetic Retinopathy Clinical Research Network (DRCR.net), which is funded by the National Eye Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health. ""This rigorous trial confirms that Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all effective treatments for diabetic macular edema,"" said NEI Director Paul A. Sieving, M.D., Ph.D. ""Eye care providers and patients can have confidence in all three drugs."" Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis are all widely used to treat DME, a consequence of diabetes that can cause blurring of central vision due to the leakage of fluid from abnormal blood vessels in the retina. The macula is the area of the retina used when looking straight ahead. The drugs are injected into the eye and work by inhibiting vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a substance that can promote abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage. Although the drugs have a similar mode of action, they differ significantly in cost. Based on Medicare allowable charges, the per-injection costs of each drug at the doses used in this study were about $1850 for Eylea, about $60 for Avastin, and about $1200 for Lucentis. DRCR.net investigators enrolled 660 people with DME at 89 clinical trial sites across the United States. When the study began, participants on average were 61 years old with 17 years of type 1 or type 2 diabetes. Only people with a visual acuity of 20/32 or worse were eligible to participate (to see clearly, a person with 20/32 vision would have to be 20 feet away from an object that a person with normal vision could see clearly at 32 feet). At enrollment, about half the participants had 20/32 to 20/40 vision. The other half had 20/50 or worse vision. In many states, a corrected visual acuity of 20/40 or better in at least one eye is required for a driver's license that allows both day- and nighttime driving. Each participant was assigned randomly to receive Eylea (2.0 milligrams/0.05 milliliter), Avastin (1.25 mg/0.05 mL), or Lucentis (0.3 mg/0.05 mL). Participants were evaluated monthly during the first year and every 4-16 weeks during the second year. Most participants received monthly injections during the first six months. Thereafter, participants received additional injections of assigned study drug until DME resolved or stabilized with no further vision improvement. Subsequently, injections were resumed if DME worsened. Additionally, laser treatment was given if DME persisted without continual improvement after six months of injections. Laser treatment alone was the standard treatment for DME until widespread adoption of anti-VEGF drugs a few years ago. Among participants with 20/40 or better vision at the trial's start, all three drugs improved vision similarly on an eye chart. On average, participants' vision improved from 20/40 vision to 20/25. Among participants with 20/50 or worse vision at the trial's start, visual acuity on average improved substantially in all three groups. At two years, Eylea participants were able to read about 3.5 additional lines on an eye chart; Lucentis participants were able to read about three additional lines, and Avastin participants improved about 2.5 lines, compared with visual acuity before treatment. Eylea outperformed Avastin at the one- and two-year time points. While Eylea outperformed Lucentis at the one-year time point, by the two-year time point gains in visual acuity were statistically no different. At the end of the trial, average visual acuity was 20/32 to 20/40 among participants in all three groups. ""The results of the DRCR Network's comparison of Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis will help doctors and their patients with diabetic macular edema choose the most appropriate therapy,"" said John A. Wells, M.D., the lead author of the study and a retinal specialist at the Palmetto Retina Center, Columbia, South Carolina. ""The study suggests there is little advantage of choosing Eylea or Lucentis over Avastin when a patient's loss of visual acuity from macular edema is mild, meaning a visual acuity of 20/40 or better. However, patients with 20/50 or worse vision loss may benefit from Eylea, which over the course of the two-year study outperformed Lucentis and Avastin."" The number of injections participants needed was about the same for all three treatment groups. Eylea, Avastin, and Lucentis participants on average required nine injections in the first year of the study and five in the second year. The need for laser treatment varied among the three treatment groups. By two years, 41 percent of participants in the Eylea group received laser treatment to treat their macular edema, compared with 64 percent of participants in the Avastin group and 52 percent in the Lucentis group. The risk of heart attack, stroke, or death from a cardiovascular condition or an unknown cause by end of the trial was higher among participants in the Lucentis group. Twelve percent of Lucentis participants had at least one event, compared with five percent of participants in the Eylea group and eight percent of participants in the Avastin group. This difference in cardiovascular rates has not been seen across all other studies, and therefore may be due to chance. Continued assessment of these serious cardiovascular events and their association with these drugs is important in future studies. Cardiovascular events such as heart attack and stroke are common complications of diabetes. The occurrence of eye complications, such as eye infections and inflammation, was similar for all three drugs. Results of the study were published online today in Ophthalmology, the journal of the American Academy of Ophthalmology. Eylea and Lucentis were provided by drug manufacturers Regeneron and Genentech, respectively. Additional research funding for this study was provided by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases, also a part of NIH.

"Newswise — Omega-3 fatty acids may lower the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal obese women, according to researchers. The protection likely comes from the fatty acids' anti-inflammatory effects, said Dr. Andrea Manni, professor and division chief of endocrinology, diabetes and metabolism, Penn State College of Medicine. Obesity is a major breast cancer risk factor in postmenopausal women, and scientists believe increased inflammation is an important underlying cause in this population. ""Omega-3 fatty acids have an anti-inflammatory effect, so that's one of the reasons why we suspected it may be particularly effective in obese women,"" Manni said. Some epidemiological data supports the idea that omega-3s protect against breast cancer, but the findings have been inconsistent. Manni suspected that data from normal-weight women obscured the results. Normal-weight women have less inflammation than heavier women, and are therefore less likely to benefit from anti-inflammatory omega-3s, he said. To tease apart the effects, Manni's team, working alongside researchers from Emory University and Colorado State University, looked at the influence of prescription omega-3 supplementation on breast density in different weight women. Breast density is a well-established biomarker for breast cancer risk, and may be an independent risk factor, as well. ""The higher the breast density, the more likely the woman will develop breast cancer,"" Manni said. The study included 266 healthy postmenopausal women with high breast density detected by routine mammograms. The women either received no treatment, the antiestrogen drug Raloxifene, the prescription omega-3 drug Lovaza or a combination of the two drugs. At the conclusion of the two-year study, the researchers found that increasing levels of omega-3 in the blood were associated with reduced breast density—but only in women with a body mass index above 29, bordering on obesity. Although Lovaza contains both of the fatty acids DHA -- 375 milligrams -- and EPA -- 465 milligrams, only DHA blood levels were associated with breast density reduction. The researchers plan to test the effect of DHA alone in obese subjects, potentially in combination with weight loss, in a future trial. ""The finding supports the idea that omega-3s, and specifically DHA, are preferentially protective in obese postmenopausal women,"" Manni said. ""This represents an example of a personalized approach to breast cancer prevention."" These findings may help to support future research looking at the direct effect of omega-3 supplementation on breast cancer incidence in obese women. Manni added that, with obesity-related cancers on the rise, the findings could have implications beyond breast cancer. The researchers also made a secondary discovery. Lovaza is an omega-3 drug FDA-approved for the treatment of severe high triglycerides at the dose of 4 milligrams daily. In the current study, the combination of Lovaza and a half recommended dose of Raloxifene at 30 milligrams, was superior to the individual treatments in reducing triglycerides and LDL -- ""bad"" -- cholesterol and increasing HDL -- ""good"" -- cholesterol.

"Despite several safe drug therapies available to help smokers quit, three-quarters report relapsing within six months of a quit attempt. University of Pennsylvania researchers Rebecca Ashare and Heath Schmidt saw potential for a permanent cessation solution in a class of FDA-approved medications used to improve cognitive impairments from Alzheimer's disease. In a study consisting of a rat trial and a human trial, Ashare and Schmidt studied the effects of two acetylcholinesterase inhibitors, or AChEIs, called galantamine and donepezil on overall nicotine intake. The rat component showed that pretreating the rodents with an AChEI decreased their nicotine consumption. Consistent with these effects, clinical trial participants taking the AChEI, not the placebo, smoked 2.3 fewer cigarettes daily, a 12 percent decrease, and noted feeling less satisfied with the cigarettes they did smoke. ""We're very interested in screening potential efficacy of anti-addiction medications in our models,"" said Schmidt, a professor in Penn's School of Nursing and Perelman School of Medicine. ""For this study, we looked at potential smoking-cessation medications."" The research itself took a translational approach, what Ashare, a professor in Penn Medicine's psychiatry department, calls bi-directional. In other words, the preclinical data informed the clinical study and vice versa. At Penn's Center for Interdisciplinary Research on Nicotine Addiction, work on smoking cessation has been ongoing since 2001. Specifically, research from Caryn Lerman, CIRNA's director and the Mary W. Calkins Professor in Psychiatry, concluded that people who quit smoking often report a decrease in what's commonly called their executive functions. ""They feel fuzzy. They're forgetful,"" Ashare said. ""Those deficits are related to their ability to quit smoking. It was this clinical aspect of smoking cessation we thought would be useful to take further."" That's when they turned to the acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. In the brain, the neurotransmitter called acetylcholine is important to cognitive functions like learning and short-term memory. When nicotine enters the body, it binds to the same receptors in the brain that acetylcholine binds to, resulting in smoking's rewarding and reinforcement effects. Acetylcholinesterase inhibitors increase acetylcholine levels in the brain and, in effect, substitute nicotine's effects. Schmidt had successfully employed such a model with other addictive substances like cocaine. He divided a group of rats into galantamine and donepezil cohorts. To mirror voluntary drug taking in humans, the rats self-administered nicotine using a lever pushed at will. Once nicotine-taking stabilized, the rats were pretreated with one of the two AChEIs. For both drugs, ""we were able to show a reduction in total nicotine self-administered,"" Schmidt said; however, there was a caveat. ""We know from the literature that upward of 30 percent of patients will report nausea and vomiting [when taking these drugs], and this will limit their compliance,"" he said. ""We had seen that these drugs reduced nicotine self-administration, but we wanted to make sure it wasn't because the rats were sick."" Unlike humans who can verbally report when they don't feel well and whose bodies react to nausea, rats lack the reflex to vomit. In previous research, Matthew Hayes, who has appointments in Penn Medicine and Penn Nursing, had shown that in rats kaolin clay consumption coats the stomach like an antacid and quells any ill effects. Collaborating with Hayes, Schmidt offered the animals kaolin clay, then compared how much they ate normally and with the addition of the AChEIs. ""At the doses shown to reduce nicotine self-administration, the AChEIs did not make our animals sick,"" Schmidt said. The findings sparked the CIRNA clinical trial, which has to date studied 33 smokers ages 18 to 60. People who were interested in quitting smoking signed on for 23 days. For the first two weeks, they continued to smoke but also took either galantamine or a placebo. Before the trial began, researchers assessed the smokers' cognitive function to get a baseline. Participants followed the regimen for two weeks and then were asked to not smoke for one full day. Two more assessments took place: after the two weeks on the cigarette-drug combination and again after that initial smoke-free day. Finally, the researchers asked the study subjects to do their best to not smoke for seven straight days, a time during which the participants still took either galantamine or a placebo. ""That week-long period is a proxy for longer-term cessation. The ability to quit smoking the first week after you make a quit attempt is highly predictive of long-term success,"" Ashare said. She's still actively recruiting for the trial, with an aim of 80 people total. Once the trial reaches that number, she'll dig into overall quit data. What she's learned so far -- that smokers who used the FDA-approved galantamine smoked fewer cigarettes per day and enjoyed them less -- is promising, particularly given that those who don't smoke during that first crucial week are 32 times more likely to quit smoking permanently. ""Our goal in investigating these different repurposed medications is not to replace the medications that are already available,"" she said. ""We know that they're effective. Our goal is to target different populations of smokers who may be more likely to experience these cognitive deficits."" There's no data to suggest that a clinician treating a smoker should prescribe one of these AChEIs now. But Ashare and Schmidt are forging a path, and, if it leads where they think it might, it could provide smokers yet another option to help them quit. Ashare and Schmidt published their work in the Nature journal Translational Psychiatry. ###",0,news_reviews_00477
"DURHAM, N.C. -- Swimmers and divers who are prone to a sudden and potentially life-threatening form of pulmonary edema in cold water could benefit from a simple and readily available dose of sildenafil, according to findings from a small study by Duke Health researchers. The drug -- best known as Viagra™ -- is normally used for treatment of male impotence, but also for pulmonary arterial hypertension. It dilates blood vessels, giving it the potential to ease an abrupt cold water-induced constriction of blood vessels in the arms and legs that can lead to blood pooling in the heart and lungs. Athletes and others with this condition -- called swimming-induced pulmonary edema, or SIPE -- cough up blood, labor to breathe and have low blood-oxygen typically brought on by swimming or scuba diving, usually in cold water. Often the symptoms dissipate over 24 hours, but the condition can be serious and even fatal and medical attention is recommended. Many don't know they are prone to the problem until they are in the water and quickly develop symptoms. ""During immersion in water, particularly cold water, susceptible people have an exaggerated degree of the normal redistribution of blood from the extremities to the chest area, causing increased pressure in the blood vessels of the lungs and leakage of fluid into the lungs,"" said Richard Moon, M.D., an anesthesiologist and medical director of the Duke Center for Hyperbaric Medicine & Environmental Physiology. ""Some cases of SIPE appear to have been the result of cardiac problems,"" said Moon, who was lead author of the study published online February 16 in Circulation: Journal of the American Heart Association. Moon and colleagues studied these responses in 10 athletes who had experienced the condition while exercising or competing in triathlons. During a carefully monitored test in Duke's hyperbaric center, the researchers had the participants exercise under water in a dive pool that recreated the conditions of a swim that could trigger the SIPE response. They compared those participants with 20 others who did not have a history of SIPE. None of the participants in either group had heart abnormalities, but the SIPE-susceptible athletes had higher pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary artery wedge pressure during the underwater exercise, confirming that SIPE is a form of pulmonary edema caused by high pressure in the blood vessels within the lungs. When the SIPE participants were given sildenafil and then performed the same underwater exercise, the pressures were no longer as elevated. ""This is a small study, but also very intensive with direct, accurate pressure measurements,"" Moon said. ""It appears that the drug, which dilates the blood vessels, could be creating more capacity in the blood vessels in the arms and legs, reducing the tendency for blood to redistribute to the thorax, and therefore reducing the high pressure in the pulmonary vessels."" One study participant, triathlete Katherine Calder-Becker, said her bouts with SIPE threatened to end her competitive career. She said she would have no problems during training in swimming pools, but then experienced debilitating shortness of breath and distress during the swim portions of competitions in colder open water. She coughed up blood and was once hospitalized. Triathlete Calder-Becker, 51, was diagnosed with SIPE and enrolled in studies at Duke in 2011. Afterward, she consulted her cardiologist and was prescribed a low dose of sildenafil that she takes shortly before competitions. ""I have successfully raced in 20 triathlons since I started taking sildenafil, including five ultra events that require 10-kilometer swims,"" Calder-Becker said. ""I have not had an incident since then. I didn't want to give up racing -- this is something my husband and I do together, and we travel together to competitions -- so it has meant everything to me to continue."" Moon said larger studies are needed to replicate the results and learn more about possible adverse side effects of the drug. He also said research is ongoing to further illuminate the causes of SIPE and potential ways of diagnosing it early. ### In addition to Moon, study authors include Stefanie D. Martina, Dionne F. Peacher, Jennifer F. Potter, Tracy E. Wester, Anne D. Cherry, Michael J. Natoli, Claire E. Otteni, Dawn N. Kernagis, William D. White, and John J. Freiberger.

"MISSION VIEJO, Calif. - Feb. 1 2016 - Can a single ingredient swap make an impact on health? According to the recently released 2015-2020 Dietary Guidelines for Americans, small shifts in food choices can make a big difference; including a shift from solid fats to oils, like the oil in fresh avocados. On the heels of this advice, a new meta-analysis (considered the best evidence and an unbiased overview of the body of knowledge on a specific topic), published in the Journal of Clinical Lipidology, adds to the growing body of research that supports the use of avocados in lieu of solid fats (and foods that have higher saturated fat content) to significantly change lipid profiles. The research, ""Impact of avocado-enriched diets on plasma lipoproteins: A meta-analysis,"" conducted at the University of the Pacific and independently funded , looked at 10 unique avocado studies with 229 participants, assessing the impact of avocados on cholesterol levels. Researchers found avocado consumption (1 to 1.5 per day) significantly reduced total cholesterol (TC), ""bad"" low density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) and triglycerides (TG) when they were substituted for sources of saturated fat. Additionally, avocado consumption did not impact ""good"" high density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL). However, the optimal amount of avocado and frequency of use needs further evaluation along with the nutritional similarities and differences between other different MUFA sources. Larger trials looking at the impact of avocados on major adverse cardiovascular events are warranted. (See conclusion of study) ""Interestingly, our results indicate that even healthy subjects with a relatively normal baseline TC (100 to 240 mg/dL), LDL-C (75 to 150 mg/dL), and TG (50 to 175 mg/dL) had significant reductions,"" says Sachin Shah, PharmD, corresponding author and expert in cardiovascular health. As we head into American Heart Health Month (February) it's important to remind people that they have the power to help control their risk factors for developing heart disease by exercising regularly, knowing cholesterol levels and keeping them under control and maintaining a healthy weight. Cardiovascular disease is responsible for one out of every four deaths; it is the number 1 killer of American women and men, and it is a leading cause of disability. ""Fresh avocado, as part of a balanced diet, and as a cholesterol-free substitute for solid fats, can help be part of the solution for maintaining normal cholesterol levels,"" says Nikki Ford, PhD, Director of Nutrition, Hass Avocado Board. ""Beyond their naturally good fats, avocados are also a delicious way to boost fiber (8 percent of DV) and fruit intakes, both of which are under consumed in American diets."" The Hass Avocado Board (HAB) continues to be a leader in educating health professionals and consumers on the benefits of avocados. HAB recently created a series of simple, quick to prepare interactive meal makeovers to show people how to make small shifts in their diets by substituting fresh avocados for other foods or ingredients higher in saturated fats. ""This study supports the body of research showing the many benefits that fresh avocados have to offer when consumed in everyday healthy eating plans,"" says Emiliano Escobedo, Executive Director, HAB. ""Through our nutrition research program, established in 2010, we are committed to increase awareness and improve understanding of the unique benefits of avocados to human health and nutrition. Clinical studies are currently underway to investigate the relationship between avocado consumption and risk factors for heart disease, diabetes, support of weight management and healthy living."" ### To view the abstract or the published article, visit http://www.lipidjournal.com/article/S1933-2874(15)00427-4/abstract.

"Robotic nephrectomy for inferior vena cava tumor thrombus has favorable outcomes and reproducibility when performed by surgeons with adequate robotic experience, according to first multi-institutional report, published in the journal of urology New York, NY, Feb. 7, 2016 - Renal cell carcinoma can sometimes spread to the inferior vena cava (IVC), the body's largest vein, posing a threat to the heart and brain. Robotic nephrectomy for inferior vena cava tumor thrombus has favorable outcomes in selected patients compared with open surgery, which can have a high rate of complications, report surgeons in The Journal of Urology®. Renal vein surgery can often be managed with minimally invasive laparoscopic techniques, but this is not typically advisable for an IVC thrombus (a fibrous clot), which is surgically far more complex with potentially fatal complications that can occur in the course of removing the thrombus and reconstructing the IVC. The first known procedure using robotic surgery of renal tumors with IVC tumor thrombi was performed in 2008. Experts from nine leading U.S. medical centers report here on their combined experience of 32 cases since 2008. Each surgeon performed between one and ten procedures for IVC tumor thrombi which ranged from one to 11 cm in length on preoperative imaging. Patient age ranged from 43 to 80 years. The IVC required cross-clamping in 24 cases. One patient had two renal veins with two caval thrombi and one patient required a synthetic patch. Surgeries lasted from three to seven hours. None of the operations was converted to open surgery and all but two patients were ambulatory on the day of or day after surgery. Twenty-one patients resumed regular diets the day after surgery. Eight patients had node positive disease and seven patients had distant recurrence 15 months later including four of those with node positive disease. ""This is a complex condition and the complication rate with open surgery is 12% to 47%, depending on the thrombus level, with a mortality rate of 5% to 10%,"" explained lead investigator Ronney Abaza, MD, Robotic Surgery Director at OhioHealth Dublin Methodist Hospital. ""Using robotic nephrectomy, our complication rate and lack of mortalities compare reasonably with open series with no grade III to V complications, according to the Clavien system, in any patient, including no deaths."" Dr Abaza added, ""While complications were relatively minor in our series, it is evident that complications are not entirely avoidable. Even with a minimally invasive approach, the surgical management of severe cancers in mostly elderly patients will likely involve complications. However, despite the complex and critical nature of these procedures, our series demonstrates favorable outcomes and reproducibility by surgeons with adequate robotic experience."" ###",0,news_reviews_00483

"WASHINGTON (Jan. 11, 2015) -- Symptoms of mild to minimal depression were associated with early indicators of heart disease in a research letter published today in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, but the study found regular exercise seems to reduce the adverse cardiovascular consequences of depression. Depression has been linked to an increased risk of heart disease and other physical ailments, and depression is commonly associated with worse outcomes for patients with heart disease and other conditions. In addition, as many as 20 percent of people hospitalized with a heart attack report symptoms of depression, while patients with heart disease have three times the risk of developing depression compared to the general population. Researchers from Emory University Hospital in Atlanta set out to learn more about the relationship between depressive symptoms and heart disease. They studied 965 people who were free of heart disease and who had no prior diagnosis of an affective, psychotic or anxiety disorder. Researchers used questionnaires to evaluate patients for depression and levels of physical activity. They also looked a several early indicators of heart disease. Researchers found arterial stiffening and inflammation--the early heart disease indicators--that accompany worsening depressive symptoms were more pronounced in people who were inactive. The indicators were less common in subjects engaging in regular physical activity. ""Our findings highlight the link between worsening depression and cardiovascular risk and support routinely assessing depression in patients to determine heart disease risk. This research also demonstrates the positive effects of exercise for all patients, including those with depressive symptoms,"" said study author Arshed A. Quyyumi, M.D., co-director of the Emory Clinical Cardiovascular Research Institute in Atlanta.

"COLLEGE PARK, Md., Dec. 22, 2015 /PRNewswire-USNewswire/ -- Fifth Quarter Fresh, a new, high-protein chocolate milk, helped high school football players improve their cognitive and motor function over the course of a season, even after experiencing concussions, a new preliminary University of Maryland study shows. The study, funded through the Maryland Industrial Partnerships program and conducted by Jae Kun Shim, a professor of kinesiology in the School of Public Health, followed 474 football players from seven high schools in Western Maryland throughout the fall 2014 season. ""High school football players, regardless of concussions, who drank Fifth Quarter Fresh chocolate milk during the season, showed positive results overall,"" said Shim. ""Athletes who drank the milk, compared to those who did not, scored higher after the season than before it started, specifically in the areas of verbal and visual memory."" Football players were tested before the season, after concussions and post-season using Immediate Post-concussion Assessment and Cognitive Testing, also called ImPACT™, a widely used computer-based evaluation for concussions. Overall, 36 variables for attention span, working memory, sustained and selective attention time, response variability, non-verbal problem solving and reaction time were measured in the study. Experimental groups drank Fifth Quarter Fresh after each practice and game, sometimes six days a week, while control groups did not consume the chocolate milk. Analysis was performed on two separate groups: athletes who experienced concussions during the season and those who did not. Both non-concussed and concussed groups showed positive effects from the chocolate milk. Non-concussed athletes who drank Maryland-produced Fifth Quarter Fresh showed better cognitive and motor scores over nine test measures after the season as compared to the control group. Concussed athletes drinking the milk improved cognitive and motor scores in four measures after the season as compared to those who did not. The remaining test scores did not show a statistically significant difference between the experimental and control groups over the season, according to Shim. He suggested that the naturally occurring high levels of specific nutrients in Fifth Quarter Fresh likely contributed to the results. ""Branched chain amino acids (BCAAs) are important for energy metabolism and neurotransmitter synthesis in the brain,"" said Shim. ""Previous studies have shown that BCAA supplementation has resulted in improved cognition in mice with brain injuries."" Shim also cited carbohydrates, calcium and electrolytes, all of which he says are likely to be critical for the recovery process after brain injuries. While the study's results indicate a strong link between milk and the reduction of concussion-related symptoms, researchers caution that more in-depth studies are necessary to be conclusive. Fifth Quarter Fresh is a fat-free chocolate milk made by combining nutrient-rich milk (yielding 40 percent more protein, calcium and electrolytes than conventional milk) with the benefits of a pasteurization process that preserves proteins and makes them easier for the body to absorb, according to the company. Fifth Quarter Fresh has a balance of fast-absorbed whey and sustained-release casein proteins that provide a quick burst of amino acids followed by a continuous supply over several more hours, according to Richard Doak, co-founder of Fifth Quarter Fresh. The company maintains that protecting student athletes and helping them perform at a higher level was the reason they created Fifth Quarter Fresh in the first place. ""We believe there is a real need to improve nutrition for young athletes. Fifth Quarter Fresh may help them prevent injuries by providing their bodies with the nutrients they need to heal and repair. This study suggests that,"" said Doak. ""Our milk provides 20 grams of protein and five grams of undamaged BCAAs per 14-ounce serving—naturally. We use no supplements and no preservatives—it is fresh chocolate milk."" Officials in Washington County, Md., home to all seven high schools participating in the study, are now considering the broad adoption of Fifth Quarter Fresh in sports programs throughout its school system. ""There is nothing more important than protecting our student-athletes,"" said Clayton Wilcox, superintendent of Washington County Public Schools. ""Now that we understand the findings of this study, we are determined to provide Fifth Quarter Fresh to all of our athletes."" Earlier this year, UMD released the preliminary results of a study showing that Fifth Quarter Fresh outperformed leading commercial workout recovery drinks for endurance recovery by 13-17 percent. Fifth Quarter Fresh is produced through the Hagerstown-based Lanco-Pennland Quality Milk Producers, a farmer-owned, farmer-run cooperative with nearly 650 members that spans the U.S. East Coast. Frederick-based Dairy Maid Dairy bottles it. The University of Maryland study was made possible by the Maryland Industrial Partnerships (MIPS) program, which jointly funds commercial product development projects teaming Maryland companies with University of Maryland faculty.

"Today, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration cleared for marketing in the United States the first cooling cap to reduce hair loss (alopecia) in female breast cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy . Hair loss is a common side effect of certain types of chemotherapy, commonly associated with the treatment of breast cancer . Hair may fall out entirely, gradually, in sections, or may become thin. Hair loss due to cancer treatment is usually temporary, but minimizing or relieving these kinds of side effects are considered important to overall treatment. ""We are pleased to see a product for breast cancer patients that can minimize chemotherapy-induced hair loss and contribute to the quality of life of these individuals,"" said William Maisel, M.D., M.P.H., acting director of the Office of Device Evaluation in the FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health. ""Managing the side effects of chemotherapy is a critical component to overall health and recovery."" The Dignitana DigniCap Cooling System is indicated to reduce the frequency and severity of alopecia during chemotherapy in breast cancer patients in which alopecia-inducing chemotherapeutic agents and doses are used. It is a computer-controlled system that circulates cooled liquid to a head-worn cooling cap during chemotherapy treatment. The cooling cap is covered by a second cap made from neoprene, which holds the cooling cap in place and acts as an insulation cover to prevent loss of cooling. The cooling action is intended to constrict blood vessels in the scalp, which, in theory, reduces the amount of chemotherapy that reaches cells in the hair follicles (hair roots). The cold also decreases the activity of the hair follicles, which slows down cell division and makes them less affected by chemotherapy. The combined actions are thought to reduce the effect chemotherapy has on the cells, which may reduce hair loss. DigniCap may not work with some chemotherapy regimens. Interested patients should talk with their doctors. The efficacy of the cooling system was studied in 122 Stage I and Stage II women with breast cancer who were undergoing chemotherapy, using recognized chemotherapy regimens that have been associated with hair loss. The data from this study may also be applied to some Stage III and IV breast cancer patients because they may have a benefit-risk profile comparable to the patients enrolled in this study. The primary endpoint was a self-assessment of hair loss by the women using standardized photographs at one month (three-six weeks) after the last chemotherapy cycle. More than 66 percent of patients treated with the DigniCap reported losing less than half their hair. Prevention of hair loss in these patients may be a significant benefit to their quality of life, and the risk of the chemotherapy drug missing an isolated grouping of the breast cancer cells in the scalp because of the cold cap is extremely rare. The most common side effects of the cooling system include cold-induced headaches and neck and shoulder discomfort, chills, and pain associated with wearing the cooling cap for an extended period of time. The FDA reviewed data for DigniCap cooling system through the de novo classification process, a regulatory pathway for some low- to moderate-risk devices that are novel and not substantially equivalent to any legally marketed device. The DigniCap Cooling System is manufactured by Dignitana Inc., in Lund, Sweden. The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation's food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products. ###",0,news_reviews_00505
"Cognitive behavioural therapy could help many people with a dental phobia overcome their fear of visiting the dentist and enable them to receive dental treatment without the need to be sedated, according to a new study by King's College London. Anxiety about visiting the dentist is common and becomes a phobia when it has a marked impact on someone's well-being; people with dental phobias typically avoid going to the dentist and end up experiencing more dental pain, poorer oral health and a detrimental effect on their quality of life. Estimates from the most recent Adult Dental Health Survey in the UK suggest around one in ten people suffers from dental phobia. Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) is a short-term therapy, typically lasting 6-10 sessions. CBT has been shown to help with a range of psychological problems, most notably for depression and anxiety-related disorders. Both cognitive and behavioural interventions have been shown to be successful in reducing dental anxiety and increasing dental attendance. The latest study, published in the British Dental Journal, looked at the characteristics of 130 patients (99 women and 31 men) attending a psychologist-led CBT service and the outcomes of their treatment. Patients attending a clinic run by the King's College London Dental Institute Health Psychology Service at Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust were surveyed for their levels of dental anxiety, general anxiety, depression, suicidal thoughts, alcohol use and oral health-related quality of life. Three-quarters of those assessed scored 19 or higher on the Modified Dental Anxiety Scale (MDAS), indicating dental phobia. The remainder all scored high on one or more items of the MDAS, suggesting a specific fear of some aspect of dentistry. Fear of dental injections and the dental drill were the most common high scoring items on the MDAS. Nearly all patients (94%) reported a knock-on effect from problems with their teeth, mouth or gums on their daily living and quality of life. A proportion of the patients surveyed were found to have other psychological conditions - 37% had high levels of general anxiety and 12% had clinically significant levels of depression. Suicidal thoughts were reported by 12% of patients and four (3%) reported a recent intent to commit suicide. Individuals were referred to support services via the care of their GP and for suicide risk, immediate action was taken based on local service guidelines. Of all patients referred, four-fifths (79%) went on to have dental treatment without the need for sedation and 6% had their dental treatment under sedation. The average number of CBT appointments required before a patient received dental treatment without sedation was five. Professor Tim Newton from the Dental Institute at King's College London and lead author of the study said: ""People with dental phobia are most commonly given sedation to allow them to become relaxed enough for a short period of time to have their dental treatment performed. However this does not help them to overcome their fear in the long term. The primary goal of our CBT service is to enable patients to receive dental treatment without the need for sedation, by working with each individual patient to set goals according to their priorities. Our study shows that after on average five CBT sessions, most people can go on to be treated by the dentist without the need to be sedated."" ""However, there is a need for people with dental phobia to be carefully assessed by trained CBT practitioners working with dental health professionals. Some of the patients referred to us were found to be experiencing additional psychological difficulties, and needed further referral and management. CBT provides a way of reducing the need for sedation in people with a phobia, but there will still be those who need sedation because they require urgent dental treatment or they are having particularly invasive treatments. Our service should be viewed as complementing sedation services rather than as an alternative, the two together providing a comprehensive care pathway for the ultimate benefit of patients."" A recent study published in the same journal, co-authored by Professor Tim Newton, showed that more women than men reported dental phobia in the 2009 Adult Dental Health Survey. Those with dental phobia were more likely to come from a lower income background, have more caries in their teeth and suffer from poorer oral health overall. ###",0,news_reviews_00512
"Newswise — LEAWOOD, KS — Osteoarthritis (OA) is one of the leading causes of disability in adults in the United States and knee OA specifically is ranked within the top 10 non-communicable diseases for global disability-adjusted life years. The lifetime risk of suffering symptomatic knee OA is estimated to be 44.7% and approximately 1 in 11 of the US population is diagnosed with symptomatic knee OA by age 60. With this knowledge, the American Medical Society for Sports Medicine (AMSSM) has released a new scientific statement that provides guidance for physicians and healthcare professionals who provide care for those patients with knee osteoarthritis. There is a general consensus that the initial management of knee OA treatment should include weight loss and strengthening exercises. However, certain aspects of treatment for knee OA are controversial. In light of these issues, the AMSSM convened an expert writing group of four sports medicine physicians to review the latest data and provide recommendations for the sports medicine community. ""We do not treat groups of people we treat individuals,"" said Dr. Thomas Trojian, Lead Author and Past AMSSM Board of Director. ""It is important to look at how a person responds to a medication. Does the person improve if given an injection of viscosupplementation more likely than placebo or intra-articular steroid? Using a network meta-analysis we are able to compare the multiple studies done on viscosupplementation and have found that people are more likely to show clinical improvement with viscosupplementation over placebo (saline) and intra-articular steroids. This is different than studies recently published that say the average response differs."" The full report, published ahead of print in the Clinical Journal of Sport Medicince (CJSM) and will appear in the (British Journal of Sports Medicine) BJSM, entitled, AMSSM Scientific Statement Concerning Viscosupplementation Injections for Knee Osteoarthritis Importance for Individual Patient Outcomes, includes the following notable AMSSM recommendations and one suggestion: • AMSSM RECOMMENDS viscosupplementation injections for Kellgren and Lawrence (KL) grade II-III knee osteoarthritis in those patients above the age of 60 based on HIGH quality evidence demonstrating benefit using OMERACT-OARSI Responder Rating but the evidence should be downgraded due to indirectness for those under 60 years of age.• AMSSM SUGGESTS viscosupplementation injections for knee osteoarthritis for those under the age of 60 based on MODERATE quality evidence due to response of treatment in those over 60.• AMSSM RECOMMENDS clinicians and researchers collect OMERACT-OARSI responder data to track individual response to the viscosupplementation.

"PHILADELPHIA -- Men with prostate cancer who are undergoing radiation therapy can benefit from yoga, researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania reported at the Society of Integrative Oncology's 12th International Conference. The new, first-of-its-kind study, led by Neha Vapiwala, MD, an associate professor in the department of Radiation Oncology at PSOM and Penn's Abramson Cancer Center, found that general quality of life and measurements of side effects often experienced by prostate cancer patients--including fatigue, sexual health, and urinary incontinence--were stable throughout a course of outpatient radiation therapy among the men participating in an intensive yoga program. ""Data have consistently shown declines in these important measures among prostate cancer patients undergoing cancer therapy without any structured fitness interventions, so the stable scores seen with our yoga program are really good news,"" Vapiwala said. Cancer-related fatigue differs from everyday-life fatigue, which is usually temporary and can be relieved by rest or sleep. Fatigue that stems from cancer or cancer treatments has been found to lower patients' quality of life even more than pain, and studies have shown that anywhere from 60 to 90 percent of patients receiving radiation therapy report this symptom. Furthermore, erectile dysfunction is reported in 21 to 85 percent of all prostate cancer patients, while urinary incontinence is reported in 24 percent of men with this disease. The possible explanation for the benefits of yoga seen in the study stems from physiologic data demonstrating its ability to help reduce cancer- as well as treatment- related fatigue and to strengthen pelvic floor muscles and increase blood flow. These latter aspects may in turn improve erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence, said Vapiwala. ""There may also be a psychosocial benefit that derives from participation in a group fitness activity that incorporates meditation and promotes overall healthiness. And all of this ultimately improves general quality of life,"" she added. Other studies have demonstrated beneficial health and quality of life effects from yoga interventions in cancer patients. However, yoga has been predominantly evaluated for breast cancer, and research on its role in alleviating prostate cancer patients' side effects has been lacking, largely due to the perception that men would not be willing to participate in this form of holistic exercise. National statistics indicate that 72 percent of those who practice yoga are female, and only 18 percent of practitioners are over the age of 55. The median age at diagnosis for cancer of the prostate is 66. ""Despite these figures, we found that a structured yoga intervention in the form of twice-weekly classes is feasible for patients during a six- to nine-week course of outpatient radiotherapy for prostate cancer,"" said Vapiwala. ""Our participation-rate finding alone is important because it is a caution against making assumptions about patients without proper evidence."" Specifically, between May 2013 and June 2014, 68 eligible prostate cancer patients were identified and offered study participation, of which 45 consented (66 percent) to attend twice-weekly yoga classes of 75 minutes each, taught by trained Eischens yoga instructors within the Abramson Cancer Center. Although 18 (40 percent) of these participants were voluntarily withdrawn early due to unavoidable and unanticipated conflicts between radiation treatment times and the yoga class schedule, the remainder were able to participate and the study's feasibility endpoint was met. ""Eischens yoga incorporates ideas from movement theory and kinesiology and is accessible to all body types and experience levels,"" said Tali Mazar Ben-Josef, DMD, a certified Eischens yoga instructor and researcher in the Abramson Cancer Center, who will present the results at the SOI meeting. Most yoga participants reported a sense of well-being at the end of each class, and upon finishing the yoga program and concluding their study involvement, many patients requested and received an at-home practice routine to fit their needs, Ben-Josef said. The effect of yoga was measured by participants' responses to a series of questions that assess overall quality-of-life, cancer-related fatigue, and prevalence of sexual and erectile dysfunction and urinary incontinence. The researchers chose these variables because they affect so many prostate cancer patients. Severity of fatigue scores demonstrated significant variability over the time of treatment, with increases by week four as expected, but then improving over the course of treatment. Erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence, and general quality of life scores demonstrated steady trends. Currently, the team is randomizing prostate cancer patients to participation vs. no participation in this structured yoga program in order to further characterize the potential benefits of yoga in this population. This trial represents an expansion of the Abramson Cancer Center's integrative medicine and wellness services that are available to patients and survivors. In addition to yoga, patients can receive training in stress-reduction techniques, meditation, reiki therapy, acupuncture, and massage. ""We offer several ways to enhance quality of life, minimize or reduce side effects of cancer and cancer treatment, and promote healing and recovery,"" Vapiwala said. ""This study represents one of many research projects we are conducting in an effort to pinpoint the best, most effective practices to help patients with these needs."" Nearly 240,000 men are diagnosed with prostate cancer each year in the United States, according to the American Cancer Society, which funded the new study. The full results from the feasibility study are expected to be published early 2016. ###",0,news_reviews_00521
"EVANSTON, Ill., Nov. 4, 2015 /PRNewswire/ -- People looking to fend off cold and flu as the winter months arrive should speak to a massage therapist about prevention strategies. Regular massages have been shown to make the immune system stronger, according to studies. ""Researchers working with patients with compromised immune systems have found massage therapy can improve how the immune system functions,"" said Jeff Smoot, President of the American Massage Therapy Association (AMTA). ""Those same benefits translate to people seeking to fight off the common cold, flu and other seasonal illnesses."" Massage therapy increases the activity level of the body's white blood cells that work to combat viruses. According to research from Cedars-Sinai, participants in a Swedish massage group experienced significant changes in lymphocytes, which play a large role in defending the body from disease.i A lymphocyte is one of the three subtypes of white blood cells in the immune system. In a controlled study composed of HIV-positive adolescents, participants who received massage therapy showed enhanced immune function by the end of the 12-week study. The immune changes included increased white blood cells knowns as natural killer (NK) cells, which provide rapid responses to viral-infected cells.ii An additional randomized study found women with stage 1 and 2 breast cancer may benefit from massage therapy for enhancing dopamine and serotonin while also increasing NK cell number and lymphocytes. Immediate massage benefits included reduced anxiety while the long-term impact increased serotonin values, natural killer cell numbers and lymphocytes,iii which work to strengthen the immune system and cognitive function during sickness.

"Restoring testosterone production in men may be as effective as replacing it, without compromising their fertility. Two phase III clinical trials show that a drug that restores the body's natural production of testosterone has no negative effect on a man's sperm count while a topical testosterone gel causes a significant drop. The findings, which are published in BJU International, could change the way men are treated for low testosterone. While testosterone replacement therapy can boost men's energy levels, sex drive, and mood, the treatment can fool the body into thinking that it is producing enough testosterone, so that it in turn starts making less of its own. This can result in a significant decrease in sperm count--leading to infertility--because the body needs its own testosterone to produce sperm. An alternative approach to testosterone replacement is based on restoring the body's natural production of testosterone with drugs similar to those used to help women ovulate. Edward Kim, MD, urologist at the University of Tennessee Medical Center and Professor at the University of Tennessee Graduate School of Medicine in Knoxville, and his colleagues compared such a drug, called Enclomiphene citrate, with testosterone replacement therapy (Androgel) in overweight men with low testosterone, or hypogonadism. In the randomized studies, 44 men started on 12.5 mg of oral enclomiphene citrate daily, with 25 men being up-titrated to 25 mg; 42 men received a topical 1.62 percent AndroGel; and 41 men received a placebo. Over five months, patients had 10 clinic visits with one overnight stay. The investigators found that Enclomiphene citrate restored blood testosterone levels to normal after 16 weeks while maintaining sperm concentrations, whereas Androgel restored blood testosterone levels but caused marked reductions in sperm concentrations by suppressing the function of the testes. ""One of the basic tenets in medicine is to do no harm. As this study has shown in a randomized, double-blind, double-dummy, placebo-controlled manner, exogenous testosterone therapy with Androgel can clearly decrease sperm production and potentially impact fertility,"" said Dr. Kim. ""This study confirmed that Enclomiphene can maintain spermatogenesis while restoring testosterone levels to normal."" ### Full citation: ""Oral Enclomiphene Citrate Raises Testosterone and Preserves Sperm Counts in Obese Hypogonadal Men, Unlike Topical Testosterone: Restoration Instead of Replacement.""

"CHAMPAIGN, Ill. - A new surgical tool that uses light to make sure surgeons removing cancerous tumors ""got it all"" was found to correlate well with traditional pathologists' diagnoses in a clinical study, showing that the tool could soon enable reliable, real-time guidance for surgeons. The interdisciplinary research team led by Stephen Boppart, a University of Illinois professor of electrical and computer engineering and of bioengineering, performed the study on 35 patients with breast cancers at the Carle Foundation Hospital in Urbana, Illinois. The results appear in the journal Cancer Research. One difficult but crucial determination for surgeons and tissue pathologists is figuring out where a tumor ends. A solid tumor may be easily identifiable, but the tissue around the main body of the tumor, known as the margin, may contain cancerous cells as well. Because of this, excess tissue surrounding the tumor is typically removed, but the question lingers of whether any cancer cells remain to re-emerge later as tumors. ""In almost all solid-tumor surgeries, there's a question of margins,"" said Dr. Boppart, who also is a medical doctor. ""Typically, surgeons will remove the tissue mass that contains the tumor and will send it to the lab. The pathologist will process, section and stain the tissue, then examine the thin sections on microscope slides. They look at the structure of the cells and other features of the tissue. The diagnosis is made based on subjective interpretation and often other pathologists are consulted. This is what we call the gold standard for diagnosis."" The new device is a hand-held probe based on a technology called optical coherence tomography (OCT) that uses light to image tissue in real time. Cancer cells and normal tissue scatter light differently because they have different microstructural and molecular features, Boppart said, so OCT gives physicians a way to quantitatively measure the cellular feature of a tumor. Surgeons can pass the OCT wand over a section of tissue and see a video on a screen, with no special chemical stains or lengthy tissue processing required. ""In many cases, you can't tell the difference between cancer cells and normal tissue with the naked eye, but with OCT they're very different,"" said Boppart, who also is affiliated with the Beckman Institute for Advanced Science and Technology at the U. of I. In the clinical study, surgeons treated patients according to the standard surgical procedure, but OCT data were collected from the margin of the tumor cavity and the margin of the removed tissue mass during surgery so that the results could be compared later. The study found that the OCT device analysis identified the differences between normal and cancerous tissue with 92 percent sensitivity and 92 percent specificity. They also found that the way that OCT spotted cancer in the removed tissue was closely correlated with the results from the postoperative pathology reports, which often came days later. ""For the first time, this study demonstrates the use of OCT for imaging tumor margins within the tumor cavity, in the patient, during surgery,"" Boppart said. ""It is likely better to check to see if any residual tumor cells might be left behind, rather than checking the tissue mass that was taken out. Then, the surgeon can intervene immediately."" The researchers will continue clinical studies with the OCT device, looking at other types of solid-state tumors. Diagnostic Photonics, a start-up company Boppart co-founded that also collaborated on the study, is commercializing the OCT probe technology for broader use. ""Ultimately, new technological innovations like this in medicine and surgery are going to improve our health care and save lives. That's when this work will be most rewarding,"" Boppart said. ### The National Institutes of Health supported this work.

"Select patients age 90 years and older with aortic stenosis (AS) can benefit from a relatively new, minimally invasive surgery for aortic valve replacement, according to an article in the September 2015 issue of the Annals of Thoracic Surgery. Key points Both transfemoral and transapical approaches to TAVR appear to be safe and effective for treatment of aortic stenosis in select patients age 90 years and older. By 6 months post-surgery, most quality-of-life measures had stabilized at a level considerably better than baseline, meaning patients quality of life was better than it was prior to surgery. Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups. As part of the PARTNER-I trial, Vinod H. Thourani, MD, from Emory University in Atlanta, and colleagues from 12 other institutions in the United States found that transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) is a safe and effective way to treat aortic stenosis in nonagenarians who qualify for the surgical technique. ""Historically, extreme elderly patients can be at a very high risk for open surgery,"" said Dr. Thourani. ""We still believe that for those 90 year olds who are low-or intermediate risk, surgical options may be a viable procedure. However, with the advent of TAVR technology, we can now offer these extreme elderly patients a treatment option that otherwise would have been high-risk or prohibitive."" Aortic stenosis is the most common acquired valve disease in elderly patients and affects nearly 3% of those over the age of 75, according to the American Heart Association. The ability to safely treat AS patients has become increasingly important; the US government predicts that the number of Americans over the age of 85 will exceed 11 million in the next 20 years. For the study, the researchers used two different approaches: transfemoral TAVR (TF-TAVR), which is the traditional approach performed via the groin, and transapical TAVR (TA-TAVR), which is performed via the heart muscle. TA-TAVR is an alternative for patients who are medically ineligible for TF-TAVR secondary to severe peripheral vascular disease. While the current study did not evaluate other alternative options for TAVR, these techniques may include transaortic, transcaval, transcarotid, or trans-subclavian. In the largest series published to date, between April 2007 and February 2012, 531 nonagenarians underwent TAVR: 329 with TF-TAVR and 202 with TA-TAVR. ""We evaluated perioperative, short-, and mid-term outcomes following both TF- and TA-TAVR,"" explained Dr. Thourani. ""Compared with an age-sex-race-matched US population, the TAVR patients had a comparable risk of mortality, and quality of life improved within 6 months of the procedure. Our study shows that age alone should not preclude referral for TAVR in patients age 90 years and older."" The study also showed that the 30-day stroke risk was 3.6% in TF-TAVR patients and 2.0% in TA-TAVR patients. Major complications, such as bleeding or vascular issues, occurred in 35% of TF-TAVR patients and 32% of TA-TAVR patients, and more than 80% of patients were discharged home after the procedure. ""Future studies are needed to address potential differences in outcomes between TF- and TA-TAVR groups,"" said Dr. Thourani, ""but I'm thrilled that we're able to give elderly people the chance to continue enjoying life in their golden years.

"WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. - Aug. 17, 2015 - Every year falls affect approximately one in three older adults living at home, with approximately one in 10 falls resulting in serious injury. Even if an injury does not occur, the fear of falling can lead to reduced activity and a loss of independence. Research has shown that vitamin D plays a key role in maintaining muscle integrity and strength and some studies suggest vitamin D may reduce the risk of falls. Homebound elderly, a generally vulnerable population due to poor dietary intake and nutrition-related health conditions as well as decreased exposure to sunlight, are at increased risk for low vitamin D levels, possibly leading to more falls. Researchers at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center set out to evaluate the feasibility of delivering a vitamin D supplement through a Meals-on-Wheels (MOW) program to improve the clients' vitamin D levels and reduce falls. The study is published in the early online edition (8/16/2015) of the Journal of the American Geriatrics Society. ""Falls in homebound older people often lead to disability and placement in a nursing home,"" said Denise Houston, Ph.D., R.D., associate professor of gerontology and geriatric medicine at Wake Forest Baptist and lead author of the study. ""One or our aging center's goals is to help people maintain their independence and live safely at home for as long as possible."" Participants in the Meals-on-Wheels program in Forsyth County, North Carolina, were recruited to take part in a five-month, single-blind randomized trial. Sixty-eight study participants received either a monthly vitamin D supplement of 100,000 international units or placebo delivered with their MOW meal. The study included the participants' history of falls and their fear of falling, blood tests at the beginning and at end of the trial to measure 25-hydroxyvitamin D (biomarker for vitamin D in blood), and a monthly diary recording falls during the trial period. At the beginning of this pilot study, the research team found that more than half of the participants had insufficient concentrations of vitamin D in the blood (less than 20 ng/ml), while less than a quarter had concentrations in the optimal range (30 ng/ml or more). The study showed that the monthly vitamin D supplement was effective in increasing the concentrations of vitamin D in the blood from insufficient to sufficient levels in all but one of the 34 people who received it, and to optimal levels in all but five people. In addition, people in the vitamin D group reported approximately half the falls of those in the control group. ""Although these initial findings are encouraging, we need to confirm the results in a larger trial,"" Houston said. The Wake Forest Baptist team currently is conducting a clinical trial to try to determine how vitamin D affects risk factors for falls such as balance and muscle strength and power. ### Funding for the study was provided by the Wake Forest Translational Science Institute and Center for Integrative Medicine and the Claude Pepper Older Americans Independence Center of Wake Forest Baptist.

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) is one of the most common anxiety disorders in older adults and is associated with poor quality of life, increased health care utilization and impaired memory. Medications and psychotherapy are the primary treatments. Many older adults prefer psychotherapy to medication for the treatment of anxiety. However, older adults who live in rural areas can face a number of barriers, including living in an area where psychotherapy is not available, so alternate methods of providing treatment could increase utilization, according to the study background. Gretchen A. Brenes, Ph.D., of the Wake Forest School of Medicine, Winston-Salem, N.C., and coauthors compared telephone-delivered cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT) with telephone-delivered nondirective supportive therapy (NST) in a randomized clinical trial of 141 adults 60 or older with generalized anxiety disorder. The participants (70 were assigned to telephone CBT and 71 to telephone NST) were followed up at two months and four months. Telephone CBT consisted of up to 11 sessions (nine required) and focused on, among other things, anxiety symptom recognition, cognitive restructuring, relaxation, coping statements and problem solving. Telephone NST was 10 sessions where participants discussed their feelings but no direct suggestions for coping were provided. The clinical trial demonstrated both treatments reduced symptoms of worry, depression and GAD, but telephone CBT was superior to telephone NST and resulted in a greater reduction of symptoms. At four month's follow-up there was greater decline in worry severity among telephone CBT participants but no significant differences in general anxiety symptoms. At four months' follow-up there also was greater decline in self-reported GAD symptoms and depressive symptoms among participants in the telephone CBT, according to the results. ""Telephone-delivered psychotherapy is one way to overcome some barriers to mental health treatment that rural older adults face,"" the study concludes. (JAMA Psychiatry.

"Effectiveness shown in tests on ovarian and bowel cancer Drug can shut down a cancer cell's metabolism Developed by researchers at the University of Warwick's Warwick Cancer Research Centre Tests conducted by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute's Cancer Genome Project New drug could be cheaper to produce and less harmful to healthy cells Tests have shown that a new cancer drug, FY26, is 49 times more potent than the clinically used treatment Cisplatin. Based on a compound of the rare precious metal osmium and developed by researchers at the University of Warwick's Department of Chemistry and the Warwick Cancer Research Unit, FY26 is able to shut down a cancer cell by exploiting weaknesses inherent in their energy generation. The researchers argue that the drug could be cheaper to produce, less harmful to healthy cells than existing treatments and has been shown to be active against cancer cells which have become resistant to platinum-based drugs. The experiments conducted by the Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute comprising 809 cancer cell lines found that FY26 was 49 times more potent than cisplatin. Similar results were obtained by the National Cancer Institute USA in tests conducted on 60 cell lines. The new drug works by forcing cancer cells to use their mitochondria, the ‘power house' of a cell, to generate the energy necessary to function. Whilst healthy cells use mitochondria to generate energy, cancer cells contain defective mitochondria which are incapable of sustaining the cell's energy requirements. In the absence of FY26, cancer cells switch from using their defective mitochondria to using metabolic activity in their cytoplasm to generate energy. By stopping this switch of energy source, the drug causes the cancer cell to die. Lead researcher Professor Peter Sadler, of the University of Warwick's Department of Chemistry, said explains: ""Healthy cells generate their energy in organelles called mitochondria, but cancer cells have defective mitochondria and are forced to generate energy through glycolysis in the cytoplasm. Our new compounds work by attacking the energy balance in cancer cells"". Commenting on the drug's benefits when compared to existing platinum-based drugs, such as Cisplatin, Professor Sadler says: ""Platinum-based drugs are used in nearly 50% of all chemotherapeutic regimens and exert their activity by damaging DNA and cannot select between cancerous and non-cancerous cells. This can lead to a wide-range of side-effects from renal failure to neurotoxicity, ototoxicity, nausea and vomiting."" ""Existing platinum-based cancer treatments often become less effective after the first course, as cancer cells learn how they are being attacked, but our new osmium compound with its different mechanism of action, remains active against cancer cells that have become resistant to drugs such as Cisplatin"". The research could also lead to substantial improvements in cancer survival rates, suggests co-researcher Dr Isolda Romero-Canelon: ""Current statistics indicate that one in every two people will develop some kind of cancer during their life time, with approximately one woman dying of ovarian cancer every two hours in the UK according to Cancer Research UK and two deaths every hour from bowel cancer. ""It is clear that a new generation of drugs is necessary to save more lives and our research points to a highly effective way of defeating cancerous cells"". The research, supported by the European Research Council and titled Potent organo-osmium compound shifts metabolism in epithelial ovarian cancer cells, is published by PNAS. The paper describes the comprehensive systems biology approach used to elucidate the mechanism of osmium action of FY26, led by PhD student Jess Hearn. Importantly this analysis also pinpointed 3 mutations in the mitochondrial DNA of ovarian cancer cells. Following the successful test results the researchers have been awarded a Wellcome Trust Pathfinder grant to begin preclinical development of organo-osmium compounds. ENDS.

"Rome, Italy, 13 June 2015: The results of a study presented today at the European League Against Rheumatism Annual Congress (EULAR 2015) showed that, in rheumatoid arthritis (RA) patients, a good clinical response to maintenance treatment with a tumour necrosis factor inhibitor (TNFi) was maintained even when the dose was reduced by one-third. Reducing the TNFi dose by two-thirds resulted in more flares (exacerbations of symptoms and signs) but these subsided when the higher dose of TNFi was restarted, and did not adversely affect subsequent progression of any disability. In some cases however, patients maintained a clinical response after stopping the TNFi altogether. ""The optimal management of RA involves achieving the lowest possible disease activity - ideally remission, and then maintaining this level of control,"" said lead author, Dr. James Galloway, Department of Rheumatology, King's College Hospital NHS Foundation Trust, UK. ""Findings from our study have shown that adopting a TNFi dose reduction strategy can still meet this objective, with no compromise on symptom control for the patient and offering a more cost-effective option by substantially reducing the high drug costs associated with TNFi maintenance therapy."" RA is a chronic inflammatory disease characterised by joint inflammation and damage, functional disability and significantly increased mortality. Early intervention using a conventional synthetic disease-modifying anti-rheumatic drug (DMARD) such as methotrexate is critical in preventing structural joint damage and progressive loss of function. For those patients who either fail to respond, or who develop an inadequate response to these drugs over time, a biologic DMARD is an effective add-on treatment option.2 The first choice of biologic therapy is usually a TNFi2 and currently identical dosing regimens of TNFi are used both to induce and then maintain a clinical response.1 Over the first six months of the study, flares (exacerbations of symptoms and signs) occurred in 14% of patients who stayed on the same TNFi dose, compared to a similar figure of 13% in those patients for whom the dose was reduced by one-third. A two-thirds dose reduction increased the odds of a flare occurring by four times compared with a one-third dose reduction, with flares occurring in 37% of patients. Post-dose reduction flares resolved when the original dose of TNFi was restarted. There were no significant differences in self-reported measures of disability (Health Assessment Questionnaire score) with either dose reduction strategy at six months. The OPTTIRA study is a 12-month multicentre, randomised controlled trial designed to evaluate if reducing TNFi doses (of either etanercept or adalimumab) caused a loss of response in RA patients who were also receiving a synthetic DMARD. To be eligible, patients had to demonstrate stable low disease activity (DAS28 less than 3.2) for over three months. Patients with serious concomitant illness, or those taking high-dose steroids (more than 10mg prednisolone daily) were excluded. Of the 47 patients who reduced, then stopped their TNFi after six months, 45% (21/47) succeeded without flaring, and their final mean DAS28 score after stopping treatment was 2.2, demonstrating low disease activity. ### Abstract Number: SAT0150 NOTES TO EDITORS: For further information on this study, or to request an interview with the study lead, please do not hesitate to contact the EULAR congress Press Office in Room 5B of Fiera Roma during EULAR 2015 or on: Email: eularpressoffice@cohnwolfe.com Onsite tel: +44 (0) 7738 890 799 / +44 (0) 20 7331 5442 Twitter: @EULAR_Press Youtube: Eular Pressoffice About EULAR The European League Against Rheumatism (EULAR) is an umbrella organisation which represents scientific societies, health professional associations and organisations for people with rheumatic diseases throughout Europe.

"PHILADELPHIA - According to a new study, women experiencing difficulty with time management, attention, organization, memory, and problem solving - often referred to as executive functions - related to menopause may find improvement with a drug already being used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). The study led by researchers at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania is the first to show that lisdexamfetamine (LDX) improved subjective and objective measures of cognitive decline commonly experienced in menopausal women. Results of the study are published online today in the journal Psychopharmacology. ""Reports of cognitive decline, particularly in executive functions, are widespread among menopausal women,"" said lead author, C. Neill Epperson, MD, professor of Psychiatry and Obstetrics and Gynecology at the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania, and director of the Penn Center for Women's Behavioral Wellness. ""There are approximately 90 million post-menopausal women living in the US alone, and with the average age of onset occurring at 52, the great majority of those women will live in the postmenopausal state for at least one-third of their lives. Therefore, promoting healthy cognitive aging among menopausal women should be a major public health goal."" The Penn-led team administered a once-daily dose of LDX for four weeks to 32 healthy, non-ADHD-diagnosed women between the ages of 45 and 60 experiencing difficulties with executive functions as a result of mid-life onset menopause, and as measured using the Brown Attention Deficit Disorder Scale (BADDS). All participants served as their own controls by being randomly assigned to cross-over to a placebo for an additional four weeks. The researchers found a 41 percent overall improvement in executive functions for women receiving LDX, compared to a 17 percent improvement when taking placebo medication. There were also significant improvements in four out of the five subscales for women taking LDX: organization and motivation for work; attention and concentration; alertness, effort, and processing speed; and working memory and accessing recall. While psychostimulants such as LDX are primarily marketed for the treatment of ADHD, they have been successful in treating cognitive complaints in some patients including postmenopausal women. They work by promoting the release of dopamine, which is impaired in ADHD and other disorders characterized by executive function problems. ""Although we observed that short-term use of LDX was well tolerated and effective in several subjective and objective areas, long-term studies of menopausal women receiving LDX are needed, similar to those conducted for ADHD patients,"" said Epperson. ""It is also important for clinicians to confirm that a woman's complaints of worsening memory are in the executive function domains, are temporally related to the transition to menopause, and are not indicative of some other pathological cognitive impairment before prescribing a trial of LDX."" ### In addition to Epperson, other Penn co-authors are Sheila Shanmugan, Deborah R.

"TOKYO--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Hitachi, Ltd. (TSE:6501, ""Hitachi"") today announced that Johns Hopkins Medicine has selected Hitachi to provide its proton beam therapy (PBT) system at Sibley Memorial Hospital located in Washington, D.C. This collaboration, which includes a 10-year maintenance service, marks the first multi-room PBT application in the nation's capital. This will be Hitachi's fifth PBT system in North America. The next-generation system ""PROBEAT"", which comes with IMPT (Intensity Modulated Proton Therapy) and cone-beam CT, will have improved spot scanning capability in all 3 gantry-type treatment rooms, along with a fixed irradiation room dedicated to cancer research. Toshiaki Higashihara, President & COO of Hitachi, Ltd. stated that, ""We are greatly honored that Johns Hopkins selected Hitachi as their proton partner. As one of the leaders in cancer research and treatment, the Johns Hopkins Sidney Kimmel Comprehensive Cancer Center's philosophy of being at the leading edge of cancer treatment through research and development is very similar to our Social Innovation concept which supports a healthy and secure society through innovative technologies, systems, solutions and services. The proton center at Sibley Memorial Hospital will be an impressive demonstration of industry and academic medicine collaborating to bring a new technology and new cancer treatment modality to Washington, D.C. and the surrounding communities. Thus, we foresee an exciting, long term relationship that will benefit cancer patients and cancer research."" In December 2007, Hitachi was the first company in the U.S. to clear FDA Premarket Notification Special 510(k) for the ""PROBEAT"" system with its spot scanning irradiation technology. Hitachi has delivered the first hospital based spot scanning system in May 2008 and has treated over 1,500 patients to date. The same spot scanning system has already been installed at Nagoya Proton Therapy Center and Hokkaido University in Japan. In fiscal year 2015 (ending March 2016), one of Hitachi's new PBT site is planning to start treatment of patients. Hitachi has shown great stability in the proton market through continued investment in research and development, track record for high clinical availability of over 98%, along with a commitment to a long term partnership with all of its clients. Given the growing demand for technical and clinical advancements in the treatment of cancer, interest in proton therapy is on the rise, with more and more hospitals and cancer treatment facilities venturing into this area. Hitachi will continue to globally expand the healthcare business where proton therapy is its flagship solution, and contribute to cancer treatment around the world. Overview of Proton Beam Therapy Proton Beam Therapy (PBT) is an advanced type of cancer radiotherapy. Protons from a hydrogen atom are extracted and accelerated up to 70% the speed of light. Its energy is concentrated directly on the tumor while avoiding radiation dose to the surrounding healthy tissues. PBT improves the quality of life for cancer patients since the patient experiences no pain during treatment and the procedure has very few side effects compared with that of traditional radiotherapy. In most cases, patients can continue with their normal daily activities while undergoing treatment. Because there are fewer side effects, PBT is expected to expand, especially for pediatric treatment. Overview of Spot Scanning Technology Unlike conventional scattering technology, spot scanning technology delivers narrow beams to the tumor and the complex tumor shape can be irradiated through repetitive beam delivery with quick position change. Spot scanning technology has been achieved by advancing the uniform quality beam extraction technology from the accelerator and beam control technology with high accuracy. Three primary benefits are: (1) more accurate irradiation which reduces the side effects to healthy tissues surrounding the tumor compared with irradiation from conventional double scattering irradiation; (2) patient-specific collimators and boluses become obsolete, shortening set up times for patients; and (3) high proton beam usage factor reducing unnecessary secondary radiation. About Hitachi, Ltd. Hitachi, Ltd. (TSE: 6501), headquartered in Tokyo, Japan, delivers innovations that answer society's challenges with our talented team and proven experience in global markets.

"Researchers have developed a score that predicts an individual's risk of dying within 5 years for people aged between 40 and 70 years old in the UK, according to new research published in The Lancet. The score, which uses measures that can be obtained by simple questionnaires without any need for physical examination, such as self-rated health and usual walking speed, could be used by individuals to improve awareness of their health status, and by doctors to identify high-risk individuals for further treatment, say the authors. Individuals can calculate their personalised 5-year mortality risk and what the study authors call an 'Ubble age' [1]?the age where the average mortality risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual?through an online questionnaire, using the dedicated interactive website [2]. The site was developed with Sense About Science [3], a UK charity that that equips people to make sense of scientific and medical claims in public discussion. ""The Ubble website allows anybody in the UK between forty and seventy years old to calculate their 'Ubble age' and their risk of dying within the next five years compared to the general population, using a simple set of a dozen or so questions,"" says study co-author Professor Erik Ingelsson from Uppsala University, Sweden. ""This is the first study of its kind which is based on a very large study sample, and is not limited to specific populations, single types of risk, or requiring laboratory testing."" [4] To create the score, Professor Ingelsson and Dr Andrea Ganna, from the Karolinska Institutet in Sweden, analysed data collected between 2006 and 2010 from nearly half a million adults aged between 40 and 70 years from the UK Biobank [5]. They used a statistical survival model to assess the probability that 655 specific demographic, lifestyle, and health measurements could predict death from any cause and six specific causes, in men and women separately. The results allow researchers to compare the predictive ability of a large number of health-related risk factors which were formerly studied separately and using different populations, although the predictive ability of risk factors does not necessarily imply they are causally related to the risk of dying. For example, the research shows that self-reported information, such as usual walking pace and illness and injuries in the past 2 years, is generally a stronger predictor of death and survival than biological measurements, such as pulse rate and blood pressure. Surprisingly, self-reported walking pace is a stronger predictor of death risk in both men and women than smoking habits and other lifestyle measurements. Self-rated overall health [6] emerged as the single most powerful predictor of death in men, and previous cancer diagnosis the strongest predictor in women (see figure 1 of the Article). When excluding individuals with serious diseases or disorders, smoking habits were the strongest predictors of mortality from any cause (figure 3). Using these findings, the researchers then developed an easy-to-calculate risk score for an individual's risk of dying in the next 5 years, based on the most predictive self-reported information, including 13 questions for men and 11 for women. The performance of the score was validated in 35810 participants enrolled at two Scottish centres which were not used to develop the score, and was found to have around 80% accuracy in men and women (table 2). UK life tables and census information were used to calibrate the score for the overall UK population. According to study co-author Dr Ganna, ""The fact that the score can be measured online in a brief questionnaire, without any need for lab tests or physical examination, is an exciting development. We hope that our score might eventually enable doctors to quickly and easily identify their highest risk patients, although more research will be needed to determine whether it can be used in this way in a clinical setting. Of course, the score has a degree of uncertainty and shouldn't be seen as a deterministic prediction. For most people, a high risk of dying in the next five years can be reduced by increased physical activity, smoking cessation, and a healthy diet."" [4] Writing in a linked Comment, Simon Thompson and Peter Willeit from the University of Cambridge in the UK say, ""One appealing aspect of the website is the representation of an individual's estimated 5 year mortality risk as what the authors call ""Ubble age"" (the age where the average risk in the population is most similar to the estimated risk of the individual); this concept is similar to that of heart age developed for communicating cardiovascular risk. Whether this will help individuals improve self-awareness of their health status, however, or only lead to so-called cyberchondria, is a moot point. Moreover, 5 year mortality is easier to predict than long-term morbidity, or quality of life and life expectancy, all of which are more important to individuals and to society."" ### NOTES TO EDITORS: This study was funded by Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation and the Swedish Research Council.

"New blood tests will speed up diagnosis for the most common GI disorder LOS ANGELES (May 14, 2015) - Millions of people afflicted by irritable bowel syndrome can now be diagnosed quickly and accurately with two simple blood tests developed by a Cedars-Sinai gastroenterologist. The tests, created by Mark Pimentel, MD, director of the GI Motility Program and Laboratory, confirm when a patient has developed IBS because of food poisoning, a major cause of the disorder. Toxins produced by bacteria, such as salmonella, can severely harm the digestive system by damaging nerves critical to healthy gut function. The new blood tests identify the presence and amount of specific antibodies reacting to the toxins. ""Having an early diagnosis means patients can avoid years of invasive tests and visits to specialists that often leave them with more questions than answers,"" he said. ""With these new blood tests, many patients will now be able to proceed right to therapy for their condition."" IBS is the most common gastroenterological disorder in the United States, affecting nearly 40 million people. An estimated 10 percent of the world's population suffers from the condition. The disorder, nearly impossible to diagnose until now, is characterized by a cluster of confounding symptoms that include chronic bloating, abdominal pain, gas, and bouts of relentless diarrhea, constipation, or both. Fatigue and the stress of trying to plan one's life around visits to the bathroom can be debilitating. A multicenter study validating the accuracy of the new blood tests, ""Development and Validation of a Biomarker for Diarrhea-Predominant Irritable Bowel Syndrome in Human Subjects,"" was published this week in the journal PLOS ONE. Pimentel will also present the research on Sunday, May 17th, at Digestive Disease Week 2015 in Washington, D.C. Pimentel and fellow researchers studied nearly 3,000 people, comparing IBS patients to those diagnosed with inflammatory bowel disease, celiac disease and those with no GI disease. The blood tests identified the two antibodies associated with IBS -- anti-Cdtb and anti-vinculin -- with greater than 90 percent certainty. The tests are marketed under the name IBSchek™ and are produced by Commonwealth Laboratories Inc., in Salem, Massachusetts. ""Most IBS patients have been told at one time or another that the disease was psychological, all in their head,"" said Pimentel. ""The fact that we can now confirm the disease through their blood, not their head, is going to end a lot of the emotional suffering I have seen these patients endure.""

Cedars-Sinai has entered into an exclusive license agreement with Commonwealth Laboratories for several patent applications covering the blood tests, developed by Pimentel to detect both anti-CdtB and anti-vinculin antibodies in the diagnosis of irritable bowel syndrome and inflammatory bowel disease. ###",0,news_reviews_00584
"Weak grip strength is linked with shorter survival and a greater risk of having a heart attack or stroke, according to an international study involving almost 140000 adults from 17 culturally and economically diverse countries [1]. The study, published in The Lancet, also found that grip strength is a stronger predictor of death than systolic blood pressure, and the authors suggest that it could be used as a quick, low-cost screening tool by doctors or other healthcare professionals to identify high-risk patients among people who develop major illnesses such as heart failure and stroke. Reduced muscular strength, which can be measured by grip strength, has been consistently linked with early death, disability, and illness. But until now, information on the prognostic value of grip strength was limited, and mainly obtained from select high-income countries. The current study followed 139691 adults aged between 35 and 70 years living in 17 countries from The Prospective Urban-Rural Epidemiology (PURE) study for an average (median) of four years. Grip strength was assessed using a handgrip dynamometer. The findings show that every 5kg decline in grip strength [2] was associated with a 16% increased risk of death from any cause; a 17% greater risk of cardiovascular death; a 17% higher risk of non-cardiovascular mortality; and more modest increases in the risk of having a heart attack (7%) or a stroke (9%). These associations persisted even after taking into account differences in other factors that can affect mortality or heart disease such as age, education level, employment status, physical activity level, and tobacco and alcohol use. A low grip strength was linked with higher death rates in people who develop cardiovascular (eg, heart attack or stroke) and non-cardiovascular diseases (eg, cancer), suggesting that muscle strength can predict the risk of death in people who develop a major illness. According to lead author Dr Darryl Leong from the Population Health Research Institute, Hamilton Health Sciences and McMaster University, Hamilton, Canada, ""Grip strength could be an easy and inexpensive test to assess an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease. Further research is needed to establish whether efforts to improve muscle strength are likely to reduce an individual's risk of death and cardiovascular disease."" [3] Writing in a linked Comment, Professor Avan Aihie Sayer from the University of Southampton, Southampton, UK, and Professor Thomas Kirkwood from Newcastle University, Newcastle upon Tyne, UK discuss whether grip strength could be a new biomarker of ageing, writing that, ""This is not a new idea, but findings from PURE add support. Loss of grip strength is unlikely to lie on a single final common pathway for the adverse effects of ageing, but it might be a particularly good marker of underlying ageing processes, perhaps because of the rarity of muscle-specific diseases contributing to change in muscle function."" ### NOTES TO EDITORS: [1] The countries involved were Canada, Sweden, United Arab Emirates, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Malaysia, Poland, South Africa, Turkey, China, Colombia, Iran, Bangladesh, India, Pakistan, and Zimbabwe.

"January 6, 2015 / It is normal for cognitive function to slightly deteriorate with age. Memory capacity begins to worsen, along with processing speed and the ability to form long-term memories. Finding a way to defer the onset of these issues becomes increasingly important as life expectancy gets longer and global populations age. This study, conducted by researchers from Italy's University of L'Aquila and Mars, Incorporated, reinforces the results of several recent cognitive studies--throwing more light on the important role diet plays in maintaining cognitive health. Dr. Giovambattista Desideri, lead author on the paper, said, ""The results of this study are encouraging--they support the idea that diet, and specifically a diet rich in cocoa flavanols, can play an important role in maintaining cognitive health as we age."" This study was the second installment in a two-part investigation by this team into the effects cocoa flavanols have on the brain. The first study, published in the journal Hypertension in 2012, found cognitive and cardiometabolic benefits of habitual cocoa flavanol consumption in older adults who had been diagnosed with mild cognitive impairment (MCI). Despite these findings, the question of the benefits of cocoa flavanols on cognitive function among individuals without MCI remained uncertain. This second study just published in the AJCN looked to address this question. Enrolling men and women aged 61-85 years with no evidence of cognitive dysfunction, the participants in this controlled, randomized, double-blind study were assigned to one of three flavanol groups, consuming a drink containing either high (993 mg), intermediate (520 mg) or low (48 mg) amounts of cocoa flavanols every day for eight weeks. The nutritionally matched drinks were specially prepared. The high- and intermediate-flavanol cocoa drinks were produced using Mars' patented Cocoapro® process, while the low-flavanol drink was made with a highly processed, alkalized cocoa powder. Other than the inclusion of the test drink, normal diets and regular lifestyle were maintained throughout the study. At the start of the study and again after eight weeks, cognitive function was assessed using a battery of tests that examined memory, retention, recall, as well as executive function. Among those individuals who regularly consumed either the high- or intermediate-flavanol drinks, there were significant improvements in overall cognitive function after only eight weeks. As cognitive function was normal for this aged population, this study shows that even cognitively healthy individuals can quickly benefit from the regular inclusion of cocoa flavanols in their diets. In addition to evaluating cognitive function, the researchers also monitored insulin resistance, blood pressure and other metabolic markers. Excitingly, there was also evidence of improvements in these cardiometabolic outcomes. In the high- and intermediate-flavanol groups, both systolic and diastolic blood pressures were reduced and insulin resistance was significantly improved. In contrast, only a modest improvement in diastolic blood pressure was observed in the low-flavanol group, with no significant improvements in either systolic blood pressure or insulin resistance among the consumers of the low-flavanol drink. It is not yet fully understood how cocoa flavanols bring about improvements in cognitive function, but the study's authors suggest that the improvements in insulin resistance and blood pressure could be revealing. ""Earlier studies suggest a central role for insulin resistance in brain aging,"" said Desideri. ""These results could therefore provide some insight into a possible mechanism of action for the cognitive improvements we have observed."" Over the past decade, there has been significant evidence indicating that consuming cocoa flavanols improves vascular function. Dr. Catherine Kwik-Uribe, human health and nutrition director at Mars, Incorporated, and co-author on this latest study, said, ""Since the brain is a heavily vascularized tissue, we might also be looking at vascular improvements as underlying the observed improvements in cognitive function."" Dr. Kwik-Uribe went on to speak about Mars' flavanol research program that has spanned over two decades: ""The amount of research showing the beneficial effects of cocoa flavanol consumption is growing and Mars is proud to be a partner in important research like this that highlights the positive role cocoa flavanols may play in supporting healthy aging."" Dr. Desideri and his team are already thinking about the next steps: ""It is clear from our latest research and other recent studies that cocoa flavanols have profound effects on the body, and specifically the brain,"" said Desideri. ""Now we'd like to know how they work and how long the effects last. If these further studies confirm the findings that brain health can be improved by consuming dietary flavanols, it may have the potential to affect the daily lives of millions of people world-wide."" Note to Editors: This research trial was carried out with a special cocoa flavanol test product, designed to deliver a standardized amount of flavanols within a nutritionally suitable drink. This test product is currently not commercially available. Flavanol content of commercially available chocolate is variable and, given its macronutrient profile, it is not recommended as a health food. About Cocoa Flavanols Flavanols are a distinct group of naturally occurring compounds that can be found in a variety of foods such as tea and red wine. Cocoa flavanols refers to the group of bioactives found naturally in fresh cocoa beans. Cocoa is an especially rich source of flavanols and the type and mixture of flavanols and procyanidins found in cocoa is unique. Mars studies show cocoa flavanols have a range of proven health benefits, including improved circulation and cardiovascular health.

"The age-old answer to inventing a cure for cancer hasn't quite happened yet, but science took another large leap forward. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration announced Monday night it granted accelerated approval to Vitrakvi (larotrectinib), a treatment for adult and pediatric patients whose cancers have a specific genetic feature (biomarker). This is the second time the agency has approved a cancer treatment based on a common biomarker across different types of tumors rather than the location in the body where the tumor originated. In layman's terms — it means doctors and researchers can attack cancer at the root of biographical markers in a body, rather than focusing on one point where a tumor originated, like the breast, colon or other cancerous organ. ""Today's approval marks another step in an important shift toward treating cancers based on their tumor genetics rather than their site of origin in the body,"" said FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, M.D. ""This new site-agnostic oncology therapy isn't specific to a cancer arising in a particular body organ, such as breast or colon cancer. Its approval reflects advances in the use of biomarkers to guide drug development and the more targeted delivery of medicine. ""We now have the ability to make sure that the right patients get the right treatment at the right time. This type of drug development program, which enrolled patients with different tumors but a common gene mutation, wouldn't have been possible a decade ago because we knew a lot less about such cancer mutations. The early beginnings of larotrectinib was studied in three clinical trials that included 55 pediatric and adult patients with solid tumors that had an identified NTRK gene fusion without a resistance mutation and were metastatic or where surgical resection was likely to result in severe morbidity, according to the FDA's statement. These patients had no satisfactory alternative treatments or had cancer that progressed following treatment. Larotrectinib demonstrated a 75 percent overall response rate across different types of solid tumors. These responses were durable, with 73 percent of responses lasting at least six months, and 39 percent lasting a year or more at the time results were analyzed. Examples of tumor types with an NTRK fusion that responded to larotrectinib include soft tissue sarcoma, salivary gland cancer, infantile fibrosarcoma, thyroid cancer and lung cancer. Vitrakvi received an accelerated approval, which enables the FDA to approve drugs for serious conditions to fill an unmet medical need using clinical trial data that is thought to predict a clinical benefit to patients. Further clinical trials are required to confirm Vitrakvi's clinical benefit and the sponsor is conducting or plans to conduct these studies. ""Using our breakthrough therapy designation and accelerated approval processes, we support innovation in precision oncology drug development and the evolution of more targeted and effective treatments for cancer patients,"" the FDA stated. ""This is especially true when it comes to pediatric cancers. We're committed to continuing to advance a more modern framework of clinical trial designs that support more targeted innovations across disease types based on our growing understanding of the underlying biology of diseases like cancer."" Common side effects reported by patients in clinical trials receiving Vitrakvi include fatigue, nausea, cough, constipation, diarrhea, dizziness, vomiting, and increased AST and ALT enzyme blood levels in the liver. Health care providers are advised to monitor patient ALT and AST liver tests every two weeks during the first month of treatment, then monthly and as clinically indicated. Women who are pregnant or breastfeeding should not take Vitrakvi because it may cause harm to a developing fetus or newborn baby. Patients should report signs of neurologic reactions such as dizziness.",1,story_reviews_00007
"(CNN) A five-minute neck scan could predict a person's risk of developing dementia a full decade before symptoms emerge, researchers have said. The test, which analyzes the pulse of blood vessels in the neck, could become part of routine testing for cognitive decline, according to the study by scientists at University College London (UCL), who presented their work Sunday at the American Heart Association's annual scientific conference. A group of almost 3,200 patients, aged 58-74, had ultrasounds on their necks in 2002, before having their cognitive functions monitored for up to 14 years, from 2002 to 2016. People with the most intense pulses, which pointed to a greater and more irregular blood flow, were up to 50% more likely to suffer reduced cognitive functions, the research found, because the strength with which blood traveled into their brains caused damage to the brain's network of blood vessels. Pulses become more intense when arteries near the heart are worn down -- usually by lifestyle factors such as poor diet and drug use -- and can no longer ""cushion"" the blood flow coming from the heart. ""If you can detect [the risk] in people in mid-life, it really gives an impetus to those people to change their lifestyle,"" said Dr. Scott Chiesa, post-doctoral researcher at UCL. ""What's good for the arteries is good for the brain,"" he added in summary of his findings. ""Dementia is not an inevitable cause of aging. How you live your life... has a real impact on how quickly your condition can decline."" If the findings are confirmed by larger studies, they could vastly improve the ability to detect dementia in middle age. And the scans would be ""well set up for routine testing,"" according to Chiesa. ""It's very easy to do, and it's very quick to do."" When healthy, arteries around the heart can regulate the blood being pumped from the organ, ensuring that it flows smoothly and at a constant rate to the brain. But damage to the arteries means blood flows more aggressively and irregularly through vessels and into the brain, which can damage its network of blood vessels and cells. Over time, the researchers believe this led more frequently to cognitive decline in participants in the study. ""What we do know is that the blood supply in the brain is incredibly important, and that maintaining a healthy heart and blood pressure is associated with a lower risk of developing dementia,"" said Carol Routledge, Director of Research at Alzheimer's Research UK, who was not involved in the research. Vascular dementia is directly caused by reduced blood flow to the brain, and this can also play a role in the development of Alzheimer's disease, studies have found. Those two conditions make up the vast majority of cases of dementia. Dementia is an umbrella term used to describe symptoms related to the loss of brain function. Alzheimer's disease and vascular dementia make up the vast majority of cases. Around 50 million people suffer from dementia worldwide, according to the World Health Organization , with numbers projected to rise to 152 million by 2050. In the United States, the condition is the sixth biggest cause of death among all adults, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, while in the UK it has overtaken heart disease as the leading cause of death, according to the Office for National Statistics. 'Promising findings' The study's findings have been met with cautious optimism by dementia organizations. ""Getting a diagnosis of dementia can be time consuming and quite frustrating for many people, so it's promising that earlier indicators of cognitive decline are in development,"" said Paul Edwards, Director of Clinical Services at Dementia UK. But he added that focus should also be paid to dementia sufferers after their diagnosis, saying: ""The elephant in the room is the lack of support for people and their families once they get a diagnosis of dementia."" There is currently no cure for dementia, though medication can be used to temporarily treat its symptoms. ""Often, a diagnosis is made and then people are sent home with no information, no follow-up appointments and no clue about what is going to happen next."" Previous studies this year have linked dementia risk to lifestyle factors such as alcohol consumption and fitness level , but its effects remain largely incurable. More research is needed to determine whether neck scans should become a part of routine testing for dementia. ""While these findings are interesting, as the full data from this research is yet to be published it is difficult to assess how useful this kind of scan could be,"" said Routledge. Routledge added that current evidence shows that not smoking, only consuming alcohol within recommended limits, staying active, monitoring cholesterol levels and eating a balanced diet can all help with the health of the heart and brain.",0,story_reviews_00013
"Lauren Pestikas sits as she receives an infusion of the drug ketamine during a 45-minute session at an outpatient clinic in Chicago on July 25, 2018. Pestikas struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before starting ketamine treatments earlier in the year. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford) Lauren Pestikas sits as she receives an infusion of the drug ketamine during a 45-minute session at an outpatient clinic in Chicago on July 25, 2018. Pestikas struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before starting ketamine treatments earlier in the year. (AP Photo/Teresa Crawford) CHICAGO (AP) — It was launched decades ago as an anesthetic for animals and people, became a potent battlefield pain reliever in Vietnam and morphed into the trippy club drug Special K. Now the chameleon drug ketamine is finding new life as an unapproved treatment for depression and suicidal behavior. Clinics have opened around the United States promising instant relief with their ""unique"" doses of ketamine in IVs, sprays or pills. And desperate patients are shelling out thousands of dollars for treatment often not covered by health insurance, with scant evidence on long-term benefits and risks. Chicago preschool teacher Lauren Pestikas long struggled with depression and anxiety and made several suicide attempts before trying ketamine earlier this year. The price tag so far is about $3,000, but ""it's worth every dime and penny,"" said the 36-year-old. Pestikas said she feels much better for a few weeks after each treatment, but the effects wear off and she scrambles to find a way to pay for another one. For now, ketamine has not received approval from the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for treating depression, though doctors can use it for that purpose. Ketamine has been around since the 1960s and is widely used as an anesthesia drug during surgery because it doesn't suppress breathing. Compared to opioids such as morphine, ketamine isn't as addictive and doesn't cause breathing problems. And some studies have shown that ketamine can ease symptoms within hours for the toughest cases. Its potential effects on depression were discovered in animal experiments in the late 1980s and early 1990s showing that glutamate, a brain chemical messenger, might play a role in depression, and that drugs including ketamine that target the glutamate pathway might work as antidepressants. Conventional antidepressants like Prozac target serotonin, a different chemical messenger, and typically take weeks to months to kick in — a lag that can cause severely depressed patients to sink deeper into despair. Ketamine's potential for almost immediate if temporary relief is what makes it so exciting, said Dr. Jennifer Vande Voort, a Mayo Clinic psychiatrist who has used ketamine to treat depression patients since February. ""We don't have a lot of things that provide that kind of effect. What I worry about is that it gets so hyped up,"" she said. The strongest studies suggest it's most useful and generally safe in providing short-term help for patients who have not benefited from antidepressants. That amounts to about one-third of the roughly 300 million people with depression worldwide. ""It truly has revolutionized the field,"" changing scientists' views on how depression affects the brain and showing that rapid relief is possible, said Yale University psychiatrist Dr. Gerard Sanacora, who has done research for or consulted with companies seeking to develop ketamine-based drugs. But to become standard depression treatment, he said, much more needs to be known. Last year, Sanacora co-authored an American Psychiatric Association task force review of ketamine treatment for mood disorders that noted the benefits but said ""major gaps"" remain in knowledge about long-term effectiveness and safety. Most studies have been small, done in research settings and not in the real world. When delivered through an IV, ketamine can cause a rapid increase in heart rate and blood pressure that could be dangerous for some patients. Ketamine also can cause hallucinations that some patients find scary. ""There are some very real concerns,"" Sanacora said. ""We do know this drug can be abused, so we have to be very careful about how this is developed."" Dr. Rahul Khare, an emergency medicine specialist in Chicago, first learned about ketamine's other potential benefits a decade ago from a depressed and anxious patient he was preparing to sedate to fix a repeat dislocated shoulder. ""He said, ‘Doc, give me what I got last time. For about three weeks after I got it I felt so much better,'"" Khare recalled. Khare became intrigued and earlier this year began offering ketamine for severe depression at an outpatient clinic he opened a few years ago. He also joined the American Society for Ketamine Physicians, formed a year ago representing about 140 U.S. doctors, nurses, psychologists and others using ketamine for depression or other nonapproved uses. There are about 150 U.S. ketamine clinics, compared with about 20 three years ago, said society co-founder Dr. Megan Oxley. Khare said the burgeoning field ""is like a new frontier"" where doctors gather at meetings and compare notes. He has treated about 50 patients with depression including Pestikas. They're typically desperate for relief after failing to respond to other antidepressants. Some have lost jobs and relationships because of severe depression, and most find that ketamine allows them to function, Khare said. Typical treatment at his clinic involves six 45-minute sessions over about two weeks, costing $550 each. Some insurers will pay about half of that, covering Khare's office visit cost. Patients can receive ""booster"" treatments. They must sign a four-page consent form that says benefits may not be long-lasting, lists potential side effects, and in bold letters states that the treatment is not government-approved. At a recent session, Pestikas's seventh, she leaned back on a reclining white examining-room chair as a nurse hooked her up to a heart and blood pressure monitor. She grimaced as a needle was slipped into the top of her left palm. Khare reached up with a syringe to inject a small dose of ketamine into an IV bag hanging above the chair, then dimmed the lights, pulled the window curtains and asked if she had questions and was feeling OK. ""No questions, just grateful,"" Pestikas replied, smiling. Pestikas listened to music on her iPhone and watched psychedelic videos. She said it was like ""a controlled acid trip"" with pleasant hallucinations. The trip ends soon after the IV is removed, but Pestikas said she feels calm and relaxed the rest of the day, and that the mood boost can last weeks. Studies suggest that a single IV dose of ketamine far smaller than used for sedation or partying can help many patients gain relief within about four hours and lasting nearly a week or so. Exactly how ketamine works is unclear, but one idea is that by elevating glutamate levels, ketamine helps nerve cells re-establish connections that were disabled by depression, said ketamine expert Dr. Carlos Zarate, chief of experimental therapies at the National Institute of Mental Health. A small Stanford University study published in August suggested that ketamine may help relieve depression by activating the brain's opioid receptors. Janssen Pharmaceuticals and Allergan are among drug companies developing ketamine-like drugs for depression. Janssen leads the effort with its nasal spray esketamine. The company filed a new drug application in September. Meanwhile, dozens of studies are underway seeking to answer some of the unknowns about ketamine including whether repeat IV treatments work better for depression and if there's a way to zero in on which patients are most likely to benefit. Until there are answers, Zarate of the mental health institute said ketamine should be a last-resort treatment for depression after other methods have failed. ___ Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at @LindseyTanner . ___ The Associated Press Health & Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute's Department of Science Education.

"En Español By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Aug. 15, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- For women with advanced breast cancer who carry the BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations, an experimental drug could improve survival, a new study suggests. The BRCA mutations are linked with a greater risk for aggressive breast and ovarian cancer. The drug, talazoparib, works by blocking an enzyme called poly ADP ribose polymerase (PARP), thus preventing cancer cells from killing healthy ones. In a phase 3 trial of 431 women, funded by the drug's maker, those who received talazoparib lived longer without their cancer progressing than women treated with standard chemotherapy by an average of three months, researchers found. ""For women with metastatic breast cancer and a BRCA mutation, PARP inhibitors may be considered for their treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Jennifer Litton, an associate professor of breast medical oncology at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. When it's functioning properly, BRCA actually helps repair damaged DNA and prevents tumors, but when BRCA1 and BRCA2 go awry, they encourage breast cancers. PARP inhibitors such as talazoparib appear to interfere with the function of mutated BRCA in breast cells, causing them to die rather replicate. In addition, several ongoing studies are looking at combinations with PARP inhibitors ""to try to expand who may benefit or lengthen how long they may work,"" Litton said. The trial results are preliminary, as talazoparib has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. In January, the FDA approved the first PARP inhibitor, Lynparza, to treat BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Similar drugs have already been used to treat advanced, BRCA-mutated ovarian cancer, according to the agency. In the current trial, the women who were randomly selected to receive talazoparib had a higher response rate to treatment than women who received standard chemotherapy: 63 percent versus 27 percent, the researchers found. The drug does have side effects. Among women receiving talazoparib, 55 percent had blood disorders, mostly anemia, compared with 38 percent of those receiving standard chemotherapy. In addition, 32 percent of the women receiving talazoparib had other side effects, compared with 38 percent of those on standard chemotherapy. Oncologist Dr. Marisa Weiss is the founder and chief medical officer of Breastcancer.org. ""Smart medicines like this PARP inhibitor work better than traditional chemo in women with HER2-negative metastatic disease and a BRCA1/2 genetic mutation,"" she said. This targeted form of treatment takes advantage of a weakness in the BRCA gene to further cripple the cancer cell's ability to repair itself, grow and spread, said Weiss, who was not involved with the study. Normal cells are mostly spared. As a result, more cancer cells are killed with fewer side effects, Weiss said. ""Most importantly, patients themselves have reported a better experience with less hair loss and improved quality of life,"" she said. Weiss advises women with advanced breast cancer to have genetic testing. ""In both my clinical practice and within the online support community, we advise women with metastatic breast cancer to get genetic testing upon diagnosis, in order to get the best care first,"" she said. The trial was funded by drug maker Pfizer, and the results were published Aug. 15 in the New England Journal of Medicine.

Soon, it seems, women like Dunham who suffer from endometriosis pain will have a new option for relief. An effective treatment was just approved by the Food and Drug Administration, and it's expected to arrive at pharmacies as soon as August. The pill, called elagolix (brand name Orilissa) from the drugmaker AbbVie, is the first FDA-approved oral treatment in more than a decade for the moderate to severe pain that comes with endometriosis. ""This [medication] could really be transformative,"" said Hugh Taylor, an OB-GYN doctor at Yale Medical School who led the key trials testing the drug. ""I'm very excited to be able to start using it in my patients."" Endometriosis is one of the most common gynecological conditions, affecting one in 10 women of reproductive age. And it can be incredibly painful. The reason is simple: Women with the condition are growing excess tissue in their abdomen that they can't shed. Every month, a woman's uterine lining thickens and sheds during her period if she's not pregnant. With endometriosis, that tissue thickens and bleeds, but it happens outside of the uterus — on the fallopian tubes, even in the nose, the lungs. Because the extra tissue has no way to exit the body (it can't go through the vagina since it's not growing in the uterus) it builds up and becomes trapped, leading to pain and, in some cases, infertility. There's no cure for endometriosis. To manage symptoms, women are usually prescribed birth control or over-the-counter painkillers as a first-line approach, but they don't always work. In severe cases, a doctor may suggest surgery to remove the extra tissue. (Dunham had eight surgeries, and ended up getting a hysterectomy, which was considered an extreme measure.) Enter elagolix. Endometriosis is an estrogen-driven disease, and the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. Two large double-blind, placebo-control randomized trials, involving 1,200 women, tested whether it can help women control endometriosis pain. The results, published last year in the New England Journal of Medicine, were pretty remarkable. The patients in those trials scored their pain from 0 (no pain) to 3 (severe pain). On average, they had pain levels of 2.2 out of 3 before starting on the drug — and they experienced a 2-point reduction in pain after taking the treatment for three months. ""It's a major advance,"" said Dr. Louis DePaolo, head of the fertility and infertility branch at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development, ""and another option women have that's effective."" Now, the less good news: The drug won't cure endometriosis — it'll only tamp down the pain it causes. Researchers have also found it causes bone loss, and they have no idea about the long-term effects of taking the drug because there are no trials lasting for longer than a year. It'll also cost women $850 per month if they don't have insurance coverage. But for some, the risks and costs may be worth it. Here's why. Endometriosis is incredibly common — but it can go undiagnosed for years The three main ways endometriosis manifests are through pelvic pain, infertility, and pelvic masses such as cysts, scar tissue, and fibroids. According to the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, some important signs of endometriosis include: Pain before and during periods Pain during sex Infertility Fatigue Painful urination during periods Painful bowel movements during periods But many women don't know they have endometriosis. It's sometimes mistaken or dismissed for regular period pain. Definitively diagnosing the disorder requires invasive surgery; doctors need to peer inside the pelvis through a laparoscopy. (Imaging is rarely helpful in getting a clear diagnosis.) This involves making a small incision in the belly and inserting a tube with a tiny camera to see if the pelvic organs show signs of tissue scarring and buildup. So it's no surprise it takes between three and 11 years after the onset of symptoms to diagnose endometriosis. Doctors aren't sure why some women get it Adding to the mystery around endometriosis: no one knows exactly what causes endometriosis, but doctors have some theories. Retrograde menstrual flow: During a period, when a woman is shedding her uterine lining, some of that tissue can flow through her fallopian tubes and into her pelvis, which researchers think may cause endometriosis. But doctors have also found that the rate of retrograde menstruation is about the same in women with and without endometriosis, so they think additional factors spur the disorder in some.

Genes: The disorder runs in families, so doctors believe there's a genetic component. If a woman's mom or sister had endometriosis, she's believed to be at a higher risk.

Immune system dysfunction: Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman's ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis. Problems with the immune system can hamper a woman's ability to clear her menstrual debris, leading to endometriosis. Environmental factors: There's some evidence to suggest environmental exposures to certain chemicals may contribute to one's risk of developing endometriosis. The treatments available don't always help — and some have severe side effects When birth control pills or over-the-counter painkillers fail to help endometriosis pain, women are often left choosing between a monthly injection called Lupron Depot, that can put women into a profoundly menopausal state, or a Danazol, a male hormone that often causes acne and facial hair growth. The new drug elagolix is not risk free, either. In the trials, women who took the drug had greater decreases in bone loss than did those who received placebo, and this wasn't entirely surprising. Like other endometriosis treatments, the drug works by lowering estrogen levels. When that happens, women experience menopausal side effects. The most common in the trials were hot flushes, headaches, and insomnia. (Elagolix is available in two doses — 150 mg per day, or 200 mg twice daily — and the women on the higher dose experienced the side effects more frequently.) But, DePaolo pointed out, ""[Elagolix] doesn't have the pronounced side effects some of the other compounds have."" That's because, he said, it doesn't drive down estrogen levels as severely. So women with endometriosis are still left choosing between terrible pain or menopausal symptoms, including bone loss. ""The game changer would be something that really improves the pain permanently,"" DePaolo said. ""This doesn't do that — but it is effective while it's given."" For some women, though, that may be a game changer in and of itself.",0,story_reviews_00047
"En Español By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, July 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- The active ingredient in pot that gets you high can calm agitation in people with advanced Alzheimer's disease, a small new study suggests. Canadian researchers found that a form of synthetic THC significantly decreased agitation in a small group of Alzheimer's patients, working even better than the drugs now used. ""This is the first clinical trial to show that a cannabinoid can decrease agitation,"" said lead researcher Krista Lanctot, a senior scientist at Sunnybrook Health Sciences Center in Toronto. However, many study patients suffered from sedation due to the drug, noted Keith Fargo, director of scientific programs and outreach at the Alzheimer's Association. ""We would love to see this study done in a larger group of people, to see if it continues to be effective in a larger group, and how worried we need to be about this sedation side effect,"" Fargo said. Agitation is a frequent symptom of advanced Alzheimer's, Lanctot explained. Doctors struggle to control it through off-label use of drugs like antipsychotics and anticonvulsants. Agitated patients yell, scream, pace and wander, she said. They also can become physically aggressive, striking out at people and hurting themselves or others. ""You're going to find one in five outpatients with it. But when you get to the long-term care facilities, about 50 percent of inpatients will have agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It's actually a big treatment challenge. The drugs we have now do not work very well and they're associated with an increase in mortality."" The off-label drugs used to treat Alzheimer's are indeed a bit dodgy. For example, only one person out of five to 14 treated with antipsychotics actually experiences a decrease in agitation, Lanctot said. And for every nine to 25 people helped, one will die. But Lanctot and her colleagues suspected that cannabinoids might help control agitation, given that natural cannabinoids in the brain decrease as Alzheimer's enters its advanced stages. ""We know cannabis has several effects that might be good for people with agitation,"" Lanctot said. ""It has a calming effect. It helps with weight loss because it helps with appetite. It's also used for pain."" The synthetic THC drug, nabilone, is approved in Canada for treating nausea and vomiting caused by chemotherapy. It comes in capsule form. ""It's a milder form of TCH"" compared to whole-leaf marijuana, Lanctot said. ""We hoped it wouldn't have the side effects associated with cannabis, but would have the calming effects."" During the clinical trial, 39 patients with moderate to severe Alzheimer's disease received nabilone for six weeks to treat their clinically significant agitation, followed by six weeks with an inactive placebo. ""We had a significant decrease in agitation. The decrease we saw was larger than is seen with the currently used medications,"" Lanctot said. Patients underwent significant overall improvement in their other behavioral symptoms, and had small benefits in their brain function and nutrition during the study. Their caregivers also reported reduced levels of stress, according to Lanctot. These benefits came with a downside, though. About 45 percent of patients experienced sedation with nabilone, compared with 16 percent for placebo, the findings showed. Lanctot and Fargo do not recommend that relatives or friends of those with agitated Alzheimer's provide them medical marijuana to ease their suffering. ""This trial tested a synthetic analog of THC. It's not THC, and it's certainly not whole-plant marijuana,"" Fargo said. ""There's virtually no data on whole-plant marijuana, whether or not it's effective or safe in people with Alzheimer's disease."" A form of synthetic THC is available in the United States, called dronabinol and sold under the trade name Marinol, Lanctot said. It's used as an appetite stimulant for people with AIDS and an anti-nausea remedy for chemotherapy patients. Marinol is now being tested for its usefulness in treating Alzheimer's symptoms, Lanctot said. People interested in trying it should reach out to one of the big clinical trials; Johns Hopkins is one of the centers testing Marinol. ""We wouldn't want to change clinical practice based on one study,"" Lanctot added. The study was to be presented Tuesday at the Alzheimer's Association meeting in Chicago. Research presented at medical meetings is considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"(CNN) Australian researchers have developed an experimental blood test they say is the first blood test capable of detecting melanoma -- an aggressive form of skin cancer -- in its early stages with a high degree of accuracy. The test could speed up the diagnosis process, saving thousands of lives. Scientists at Edith Cowan University in Western Australia tested blood samples for the antibodies typically created by the immune system in response to melanoma and identified them with significant accuracy. Antibodies ""are easily accessible in the blood, so it provides a fantastic test to identify an early-stage cancer,"" said project lead Professor Mel Ziman, leader of the university's Melanoma Research Group on Monday. In the study , published Tuesday in the journal Oncotarget, Ziman's team screened 245 blood samples from both melanoma patients and healthy volunteers. The researchers were able to identify people with melanoma with 79% accuracy and people without a melanoma with 84% accuracy. ""In order for it to be valued by clinicians we would need to get to 90% accuracy in detection,"" she said. ""So we are doing a clinical trial with 1000 participants to refine our test to get to this point."" If further trials are successful, Ziman estimates the test could be distributed internationally in up to five years. Patients who returned a positive result would still need a biopsy to confirm the blood test and determine how far the cancer had developed, Ziman said. Multiple groups worldwide are working to develop blood tests that detect a range of cancers. A recent study showed promise for a test detecting tumors of the ovary, liver, stomach, pancreas, esophagus, colorectum, lung and breast, while another study claimed to detect 10 cancers, including 90% accuracy for ovarian cancer. The Australian team believe theirs would be the first to detect melanoma. 'In the wrong place with the wrong skin color' Melanoma cancers are dangerous, abnormal growths on the surface of the skin caused by sun damage, which can spread throughout the body if left untreated. A melanoma skin cancer. The problem is particularly serious in Australia, where melanomas were the fourth most commonly diagnosed cancer in 2017 and cause about 1,700 deaths a year, according to the university. This is in large part due to high levels of UV exposure caused by the region's proximity to the ozone hole over the Antarctic. ""We're in the wrong place with the wrong skin color. We've had a lot of migrants from European nations, so they're fair-skinned ... and we do have a very intense sun here,"" Ziman said. If detected early, skin cancers have a survival rate as high as 95%, the research team said, but it drops to just 50% if diagnosed late. Surgery to remove the growth is the most common form of treatment. Simpler detection Ziman said current methods of melanoma detection are expensive and invasive, involving a trip to a clinician, who must biopsy the lesion to discover whether it is cancerous. For potential sufferers in remote areas, away from skin specialists, diagnosis can be especially tricky, he said, making a simple blood test an easy alternative to identify those at risk. Over three years, the research team identified a combination of 10 types of antibodies that best signal the presence of a melanoma. Antibodies are the products of the body's immune system, created to battle not only bacteria and viruses but abnormal cancer cells, Ziman said. Follow CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. Dr. Jodie Moffat, head of early diagnosis at Cancer Research UK, agreed that a test which finds melanoma earlier could help reduce deaths from the disease, adding that ""melanoma can be more than skin deep, and it's much harder to treat when diagnosed at a late stage after it has spread."" However, she stressed the fact this new test has not undergone clinical trials. ""We need to know how accurate it is, if it can save lives, and how it could work in practice. So, although a blood test to find skin cancer earlier is certainly exciting, research in this field still has hurdles to overcome,"" she said. In the meantime, ""people can help spot skin cancer early by knowing what's normal for their skin,"" said Moffat. In turn people should talk to a health professional about any ""unusual or lasting changes to a mole, freckle or normal patch of skin.""",0,story_reviews_00049

"(Reuters Health) - Waning eyesight may hasten the pace of cognitive decline in older people, suggests a U.S. study. The results suggest that vision fixes, like a new eyeglass prescription or surgery to remove cataracts, can go a long way toward helping older people stay mentally sharp, said lead author D. Diane Zheng of the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. ""Taking care of your vision is important in order to maintain good cognitive function,"" she said in a telephone interview. Poor eyesight and weakening mental function are common in older people and related to one another, but the question of whether vision influences cognition, or vice versa, has not been clear, the study team writes in JAMA Ophthalmology. To investigate, Zheng's team followed 2,520 adults for eight years, testing their vision and cognitive status every other year. Over the course of the study, average visual decline was roughly equivalent to losing the ability to read one line of an eye chart. People who had worse vision at the beginning of the study had worse scores on the cognitive exam as well. A person's vision at their previous check-up was related to their mental function at the following check-up. While mental function at one check-up was also related to vision at the following exam, the effect of vision on subsequent mental function was significantly stronger. While the mechanism behind the vision-cognition relationship isn't well understood, Zheng said, worsening vision can discourage people from brain-stimulating activities like doing crosswords and engaging with other people. She recommended that older adults get regular eye checkups, and have any vision symptoms checked out and treated promptly. ""This study provides additional evidence that would suggest that people who can keep their vision healthy as they age might also be protecting their cognitive health,"" said Dr. Heather E. Whitson of Duke University School of Medicine and Durham VA Medical Center, who wasn't involved in the research. ""If you're aging without good vision, not only are you giving your brain less stimulation, you might be altering your brain at a structural level,"" she said in a phone interview. The good news, Whitson added, is that poor vision is one of the few risk factors for cognitive decline that is potentially modifiable. Even incurable causes of age-related vision loss such as glaucoma and age-related macular degeneration ""are highly treatable, so we can reduce the amount of vision loss that people suffer from if they're detected early.""

"Doctors Try Genetically Modified Poliovirus As Experimental Brain Cancer Treatment A genetically modified poliovirus may help some patients fight a deadly form of brain cancer, researchers report. The experimental treatment seems to have extended survival in a small group of patients with glioblastoma who faced a grim prognosis because standard treatments had failed, Duke University researchers say. ""I've been doing this for 50 years and I've never seen results like this,"" says Dr. Darell Bigner, the director emeritus of the The Preston Robert Tisch Brain Tumor Center at the Duke Cancer Institute, who is helping develop the treatment. But the researchers and other brain-cancer doctors caution the research is at a very early stage. In the study, only 21 percent of patients experienced a prolonged survival. Much more follow-up research is needed to better assess and hopefully improve the treatment's effectiveness, the researchers say. ""We have to be careful,"" says Annick Desjardins, a Duke neuro-oncologist who helped conduct the study. ""But we have long-term survivors. We are seeing something we don't normally see with patients with glioblastoma."" Dr. David Reardon, clinical director of the Center for Neuro-Oncology at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, says the Duke group's results may represent ""a good, solid, important step forward"" for patients with no alternatives. ""Unfortunately, for most patients this is not going to be the answer yet,"" says Reardon, who used to work at Duke but wasn't involved in the new research. ""My fear is that every patient and family dealing with the devastating disease of glioblastoma is going to think the poliovirus is the cure. Unfortunately, the patients who are benefiting do reflect a relatively small percentage of the population."" The Duke results were published online Tuesday by the New England Journal of Medicine to coincide with their presentation at the 22nd International Conference on Brain Tumor Research in Norway. Glioblastoma is the most common and aggressive malignant brain tumor in adults. It's the cancer that killed former Sen. Edward Kennedy, D-Mass., and former Vice President Joe Biden's son Beau. Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., is fighting glioblastoma. The Duke researchers decided to try to use a genetically modified version of the poliovirus, which can cause a devastating form of paralysis, because of the virus's ability to infect nervous system cells. The scientists removed one of the virus's genes to prevent it from causing polio and replaced that gene with one from a harmless virus known as a rhinovirus, which ordinarily causes the common cold. The engineered virus was then infused directly into tumors in patients' brains with a tube inserted through a hole in the skull. The modified virus retains the ability to infect and kill brain tumor cells, and also appears to trigger the patient's own immune system cells to attack the tumors, the researchers say. Between 2012 and 2017, the researchers treated 61 patients, trying various doses of the modified virus to determine which was safest and most effective. There are substantial risks. The treatment can cause a dangerous swelling in the brain that can lead to seizures and other complications, the researchers found. One patient suffered a life-threatening blood clot in the brain that required surgery. But overall, the median length of survival was 12.5 months for patients treated with poliovirus, compared with 11.3 months for a similar group of patients treated in the past, the researchers report. And starting at two years after treatment, the two groups' survival rate began to diverge, the researchers reported. After 24 months, 21 percent of the patients treated with the virus had survived compared with 14 percent of the historical comparison group. After three years, 21 percent of the poliovirus treated patients survived, compared with 4 percent of the other group, according to the researchers. Two patients have survived more than six years, Bigner says. One has survived more than five years. ""You just don't see this percentage of long-term survivors with this disease,"" Bigner says. ""Those that have survived more than two years are in remission, and we expect them to continue to be long-term survivors."" Some other researchers praised the results. ""We're extraordinarily encouraged by what we see with this data,"" says Mitchel Berger, chairman of neurosurgery at the University of California, San Francisco and director of its center for brain tumors. ""It's phenomenal."" But some cancer doctors caution that comparing the outcomes for patients receiving the virus treatment to what would have happened to similar patients in the past could produce misleading conclusions. The Duke researchers have started a follow-up study combining the treatment with a chemotherapy drug to try to improve the results. They also plan to combine the treatment with other drugs, including some called checkpoint inhibitors, to harness the immune system to fight cancer. In addition, the researchers are planning to try the approach on children with brain cancer, as well as other types of cancer, including melanoma and breast cancer. ""We believe we are going to be able to increase the results even more significantly,"" Bigner says.",0,story_reviews_00056
"Scientists have developed a spit test that could identify the men most at risk of developing prostate cancer. By testing a man's DNA, researchers can look for genes linked to the disease, which one in seven men in the Western world will be diagnosed with in their lifetime. Scientists in the U.K. and U.S. who helped piece together the study, published in Nature Genetics, found 63 new gene variants linked to prostate cancer. This was achieved by assessing the DNA of 80,000 prostate cancer patients and 61,000 men without the disease. The resulting test hones in on these and the existing 100 known markers to pinpoint the 1 percent of men who are at six times greater risk of developing the condition, and the 10 percent of men who have a threefold greater risk of developing the disease, a study author told The Guardian. Getty Images The new method is being trialed on 300 men in doctor surgeries across London, and is due to be expanded to 5,000 next year, according to BBC News. If it is found to be effective, it could be an important tool for physicians. Although prostate cancer is the second leading cause of cancer death in the U.S. after lung, few risk factors have been found, and it is difficult to accurately diagnose. Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now Most men with prostate cancer do not experience symptoms. Doctors can use the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test to detect protein produced by prostate and cancerous cells, respectively. But as these antigens can be present in men without the cancer, it carries a risk of returning a false positive that can kick-start unnecessary, life-changing treatment. Rectal examinations and biopsies are also used to test for the disease. According to the American Cancer Society, over 160,600 new cases of prostate cancer are diagnosed each year, and around 29,400 people die of the disease. The condition is rare in those below the age of 40; older men and African-Americans are most at risk. The majority of cases are caught at around 66. Rosalind Eeles, an author of the study at the U.K.-based Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) who specializes in finding genetic variants that increase the risk of prostate cancer, told The Guardian the team is ""excited by the test"" because it can be used by doctors to offer patients targeted screenings. Carl Alexander, a spokesman from the charity Cancer Research UK, said: ""This study is an exciting example of how research can find clues in our genes to help us uncover those more likely to develop the disease. The next steps should be to understand how this research can be developed into tests that could identify men who might be more likely to develop aggressive cancers, and how this could be rolled out to patients."" Dr. Iain Frame, the director of research at the charity Prostate Cancer UK, highlighted that men with a family history of prostate cancer are two-and-a-half times more likely to be diagnosed with the disease compared to a man with no family history. ""With Father's Day fast approaching, use it as an opportunity to ask your dad, your brother, your uncle, your friends about their risk of prostate cancer.

"A surprising (but welcome) side effect of a therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder may pave the way for a new approach to treating type 2 diabetes — and offer new insights into the links between obesity and the metabolic disease that afflicts close to 1 in 10 American adults. The therapy in question is deep brain stimulation of the nucleus accumbens, a structure best known for its role in motivation, reward and addiction. It now appears that deep brain stimulation also increases the liver's and muscles' ability to take up and use insulin, researchers reported this week. That's important because the ability to use insulin effectively is compromised in most people with obesity and seriously impaired in those with type 2 diabetes. This curious side effect of deep brain stimulation became clear after an obese man with diabetes who had suffered the repetitive thoughts and behaviors of OCD was treated for the psychiatric condition with a device that delivers electrical impulses into the brain. Advertisement Once the device was implanted and turned on, it prompted the release of the neurotransmitter dopamine throughout the ventral striatum, in which the nucleus accumbens sits. In short order, the patient noticed that his blood sugar control improved, and his daily need for insulin injections decreased by roughly 80%. The new study appeared this week in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The research is likely to generate renewed interest in understanding the addictive powers of food for some people and whether the brain processes behind that addiction also make people with obesity more vulnerable to diabetes, depression, heart disease and even some cancers. ""The connection between brain and metabolism is only partially understood,"" said Dr. Miguel Alonso-Alonso, who directs Harvard University's Mind Brain Behavior Interfaculty Initiative. Most research to date has focused on the hormonal influence of the hypothalamus, a structure adjoining the ventral striatum, on basic bodily functions, he added. Advertisement ""This is a new and exciting direction with the involvement of the striatum, a key reward center,"" Alonso-Alonso said. At the same time, he cautioned that ""we first need to establish the nature of this association, understand its magnitude and its clinical relevance"" before these early findings could be considered the basis for treatment. That a single patient's metabolic function improved after he got a pacemaker in the brain might have met with a shrug anywhere else. But to the Dutch authors of the new research, it was a clue that warranted further investigation. To explore the brain's role in metabolism more rigorously, the researchers, led by Kasper W. ter Horst of the University of Amsterdam's Academic Medical Center, recruited 14 patients who also had had a brain stimulator implanted at the edge of the nucleus accumbens as treatment for OCD. None of the 14 subjects recruited had type 2 diabetes. But even healthy people vary daily and hourly in the ability of fat, liver and muscles to take up insulin from the bloodstream and use it to convert food to energy. This measure of metabolic health is called ""insulin sensitivity,"" and it is one of many metabolic functions that goes awry in people with obesity. In those who develop type 2 diabetes, sensitivity to insulin becomes so impaired that the body is tricked into believing less insulin is needed, and it pares back its production. The insulin-producing cells in the pancreas will often atrophy and die in response. As a person's insulin production declines, an external supply of insulin is needed to control blood sugar and deliver fuel to muscles and organs. As the researchers turned the 12 subjects' brain stimulators on and off, they could see the subjects' insulin sensitivity rise and fall. Metabolic function was better when their brain stimulators were turned on than when the devices were silenced. The Dutch team ruled out that the performance improvement came from changes in other hormones that can affect metabolism, such as cortisol, epinephrine and norepinephrine. The action of dopamine in the nucleus accumbens appeared to be effecting the changes. The researchers also gleaned a potentially important insight about how obesity may lead to worsening metabolic function: The effect of the deep brain stimulation appeared to be greater in the seven research subjects who were lean than it was in the seven who were either overweight or obese. Since long-term obesity is linked to changes in the striatal dopamine system, the differing responses of lean and overweight subjects suggest that those changes may start the ball rolling toward development of type 2 diabetes.. Advertisement In a further experimental group of 10 healthy humans, the researchers found that using drugs to reduce dopamine levels across the body generated the opposite response, decreasing insulin sensitivity. In mice, too, the researchers explored the role of the dopamine-fueled neurons of the nucleus accumbens. Using a technique called optogenetics, they bred mice with certain brain cells that could be activated when light of a particular frequency is shined on them. Light stimulation of the dopamine-expressing neurons in the brains of mice ""was sufficient to improve glucose tolerance"" and improve insulin sensitivity, the authors reported. That suggests ""a key role for striatal neuronal activity in the central regulation of metabolism,"" they added. The emerging data ""suggest that the brain may play a much more active and complex role in the regulation of metabolism than we usually believe,"" said Alonso-Alonso, who has explored the brain's role in metabolism by using a less invasive means of activation called transcranial magnetic stimulation. ""This makes sense, because at the end, metabolic needs should align well with the overall state of the individual,"" he said. It stands to reason that there's cross-talk among key physiological functions; an individual's cognitive, mental and social states; and situational circumstances, he added. ""I think there are real good opportunities here for this integrative research; we need to learn more about this connection,"" Alonso-Alonso said. melissa.healy@latimes.com @LATMelissaHealy Advertisement MORE IN SCIENCE The asteroid that wiped out the dinosaurs also shaped the evolution of birds To get smokers to quit, money works better than electronic cigarettes New ‘unified theory' of childhood leukemia raises possibility of preventing the disease",0,story_reviews_00067
"THURSDAY, May 24, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Because vertigo can have many causes, treating it can be difficult, but researchers have identified a new type that may be effectively treated with medication. ""These conditions can be difficult to diagnose and quite debilitating for people, so it's exciting to be able to discover this new diagnosis of a condition that may respond to treatment,"" said Dr. Ji-Soo Kim, a researcher at Seoul National University in South Korea. Vertigo -- episodes of dizziness that can last for minutes or days -- may be triggered by a number of health issues, ranging from an inner ear disorder to tumors. In some cases, the cause is unclear. Patients can also experience other uncomfortable symptoms, including vomiting, headaches and motion sickness. For the study, researchers recruited 338 people who had vertigo with an unknown cause. Some had attacks rarely, maybe once a year. Others had them two to three times a week. Participants also developed nausea, headaches and could not tolerate head movements during the attacks. To diagnose the new vertigo, the researchers had patients sit in a dark room. They then moved each patient's head forward and shook it from side to side for about 15 seconds. Afterwards, a video recorded the patients' eye movements. The researchers noticed that uncontrolled eye movements, called nystagmus, lasted longer in people with this new form of vertigo. The findings were published online May 23 in Neurology. ""It's possible that the vertigo occurs when this unstable mechanism is disrupted by factors either within the person's body or in their environment,"" Kim said in a journal news release. This new form of the condition is called recurrent spontaneous vertigo with head-shaking nystagmus. Thirty-five study participants had this form of vertigo. They were compared to 35 others whose vertigo is triggered by other conditions, including the inner ear disorder Meniere's disease. Those with the newly identified form of vertigo experienced uncontrolled eye movements for 12 seconds -- twice as long as those with Meniere's and five seconds longer than those with vestibular migraine and another inner ear disorder called vestibular neuritis. Those with the new form of vertigo were also more likely to have severe motion sickness than those with other forms of the condition, the study showed. Preventative medication was given to 20 of the 35 people with the newly detected type of vertigo. Of these, one-third saw their symptoms reduced or they recovered completely. The researchers followed the new vertigo patients for an average of 12 years. Five had no more attacks, 14 had an improvement in their condition, and only one person had a worsening of symptoms.

REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo (Reuters) - The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on Friday expanded the use of Novartis AG's relapsing multiple sclerosis (MS) drug Gilenya to treat children and adolescents. MS is a chronic, inflammatory, autoimmune disease of the central nervous system that disrupts communication between the brain and other parts of the body and is among the most common causes of neurological disability in young adults. Gilenya is the first FDA-approved drug to treat pediatric patients suffering from relapsing MS, the U.S. health regulator said. In a clinical trial 86 percent of patients receiving Gilenya remained relapse-free after 24 months of treatment, compared to 46 percent of those who were administered another MS drug.

"ZURICH (Reuters) - Roche's Tecentriq immunotherapy combined with other drugs boosted lung cancer patients' survival versus an older cocktail, the Swiss company said as it seeks an edge on Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb. FILE PHOTO: The logo of Swiss pharmaceutical company Roche is seen outside their headquarters in Basel, Switzerland, January 30, 2014. REUTERS/Ruben Sprich/File Photo Mixing Tecentriq with Avastin and carboplatin and paclitaxel boosted overall survival in first-line treatment of non-squamous non-small cell lung cancer, Roche said on Monday, compared to patients who received only Avastin plus the two chemotherapies. The latest trial success follows Roche's announcement last week about a separate study in which Tecentriq mixed with chemotherapies carboplatin and Abraxane boosted progression-free survival, compared with chemotherapy alone, in first-line treatment of patients with advanced squamous non-small cell lung cancer. The Basel-based company, which had previously announced Tecentriq, Avastin and chemotherapy had reduced the risk of disease progression or death, said on Monday it hopes for a quick approval from authorities for the cocktail. While Roche did not provide specific overall survival data, the headline result helps its bid to catch up to better-established immunotherapies from Merck and Bristol-Myers Squibb and its shares rose about 1 percent in early trading. ""We are pleased the IMpower150 study demonstrated a clinically meaningful survival benefit for people receiving their initial treatment for this type of advanced lung cancer,"" said Sandra Horning, Roche's chief medical officer. She also said the survival benefit was observed across key subgroups, including those with varying levels of a protein called PD-L1 that can help tumors avoid detection. This could help Roche make the case that its cocktail is suitable for broad patients groups, not just those with specific biomarkers. The world's biggest maker of cancer drugs is counting on growing sales of Tecentriq, which notched 487 million Swiss francs in 2017, to help offset falling revenue from its older cancer medicines Avastin, Rituxan and Herceptin whose patent expirations are exposing them to rivals' cheaper copies. Analysts from Baader Helvea said its announcement completes an ""already robust"" set of data for regulators who now must sign off on Tecentriq's use as an initial treatment of lung cancer. ""We continue to see Roche efficacy more than sufficiently competitive to grant a 43 percent market share in the indication, translating in 4.9 billion francs Tecentriq peak sales and 1.2 billion francs in 2018,"" Baader's Bruno Bulic said. ""Facing biosimilar competition... we see Tecentriq sales coming timely to support Roche's profitability going forward.""",0,story_reviews_00090

"Almost sixty years since the FDA approved the pill for birth control in women, a male version may finally be on the horizon. Researchers have developed a prototype male pill that appears to be safe in a month-long trial. More attractive to many men than a long-acting injection or topical gel—both of which are in development—the prototype pill offers a ""major step forward"" in male contraception, Stephanie Page, a professor at the University of Washington in Seattle and senior investigator on the study, said in a statement. The once-daily prototype pill suppressed certain hormones to the low levels you'd expect to see with effective longer-term contraceptives, results from an ENDO 2018, the Endocrine Society's annual meeting in Chicago, abstract show. See all of the best photos of the week in these slideshows Philippe Huguen/AFP/Getty Images The prototype pill—dimethandrolone undecanoate (DMAU)—is somewhat similar to the combined female pill, which contains estrogen and a steroid hormone. Rather than estrogen, DMAU uses a male hormone like testosterone. Currently available forms of testosterone can exit the body too quickly for use in a once-daily pill. The ""undecanoate"" in DMAU, however, is a long-chain fatty acid that can slow the drug's journey out of the body, Page said. Eighty-three men took various doses of DMAU or a placebo for a month. Researchers analyzed the men's hormones and cholesterol with blood tests at the start and end of the study. They found testosterone and two hormones needed for the production of sperm were notably suppressed in men who took the highest dose of DMAU. While some subjects on all doses experienced mild weight gain, DMAU appeared safe. All participants passed safety tests including liver and kidney health checks. ""Despite having low levels of circulating testosterone, very few subjects reported symptoms consistent with testosterone deficiency or excess,"" Page said. There were no significant changes in mood or sexual function, but a minority of participants did experience decreased libido during the study. Page has high hopes for the results, calling them ""unprecedented in the development of a prototype male pill."" Longer-term studies are the next step toward a once-daily male contraceptive pill, she said.",0,story_reviews_00093
"En Español By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, March 20, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- Tiny pellets could treat arthritic knee pain, delaying the need for knee replacement surgery, a small study has found. Microparticles inserted into small blood vessels around the knee helped reduce the pain and improve function in eight arthritis sufferers, according to clinical trial results. The results were presented Monday at the Society of Interventional Radiology's annual meeting, in Los Angeles. ""Patients overall were able to improve their physical function in the knee after the procedure, and there were no adverse events related to this treatment,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sandeep Bagla. Bagla is director of interventional radiology at the Vascular Institute of Virginia in Woodbridge. Boston Scientific, maker of the microparticles, funded the study. Much of the pain that comes from knee arthritis actually stems from inflammation in the lining of the knee joint, also called the synovium, Bagla said. In fact, small blood vessels created by degenerative arthritis feed this inflammation by increasing blood flow to the lining. To treat this, Bagla and his colleagues decided to try blocking those tiny blood vessels using microparticles -- spheres about a tenth of a millimeter in size made from a synthetic gel-like material. The microparticles are inserted using a catheter run through a pinhole-sized incision, in a procedure that lasts between 45 and 90 minutes, Bagla said. ""It's an outpatient procedure, and no physical therapy is required before or after this procedure,"" he said. The small pilot study -- the first U.S. clinical trial of this procedure -- involved 20 patients with moderate to severe arthritis pain. Only 13 had undergone the procedure by the time of Monday's annual meeting, and only eight had made it to the one-month follow-up, Bagla said. Those eight patients averaged a 58-point decrease in pain, as measured on a 100-point visual scale used to estimate pain, Bagla said. They started with an average baseline of 72, which means their pain was brought down to manageable levels, he said. Physical function of their knee also improved, based on an index used to judge the effects of osteoarthritis, Bagla added. Overall, the two scales represented an 80 percent improvement in function, the researchers concluded. Bagla said no side effects are expected because the procedure only blocks additional blood flow to the knee, rather than cutting it off altogether. ""You don't normally have this degree of increased blood supply to this lining. We're not blocking normal blood vessels to the knee or leg or bone or cartilage,"" he said. Final results from this clinical trial are expected to be released this summer. Researchers are already kicking off a second, larger trial to better understand how the procedure works and which patients it might benefit, Bagla said. They think it will be most appropriate for people between ages 40 and 70 who aren't ready to go through knee replacement, or people who are on chronic pain medication for their knee arthritis, Bagla said. ""Perhaps we can demonstrate and prove patients do not need to be on these medications and can alternatively go through a minimally invasive procedure like this to reduce their knee pain,"" Bagla said. Dr. Suresh Vedantham, president of the Society of Interventional Radiology, called the new procedure ""very promising,"" given that it focuses on the inflamed knee lining that causes the pain. ""This therapy is very well-targeted to that particular mechanism, and certainly it should be investigated further,"" said Vedantham, who wasn't involved with the study. He's a professor of radiology and surgery at the Mallinckrodt Institute of Radiology at Washington University in St. Louis. Research presented at medical meetings is typically considered preliminary until it is published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"En Español TUESDAY, March 13, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- A pill that combines three blood pressure-lowering drugs improves people's chances of lowering their high blood pressure, researchers report. The pill contains low doses of the three medications -- telmisartan, amlodipine and chlorthalidone. The finding stems from a study of 700 people, who averaged 56 years old. All had high blood pressure. Among those who took the so-called ""triple pill"" for six months, 70 percent had achieved their blood pressure targets, compared with 55 percent of those who received their usual care. Usual care meant taking whatever blood pressure medicine their doctor prescribed. The rate of side effects was no greater among those who took the three-in-one pill than among the usual care group. ""Based on our findings, we conclude that this new method of using blood pressure-lowering drugs was more effective and just as safe as current approaches,"" lead author Ruth Webster said in a news release from the American College of Cardiology. She's a researcher with the George Institute for Global Health at the University of New South Wales in Sydney, Australia. The study was presented Monday at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Orlando, Fla. The findings should be considered preliminary because research presented at meetings has not undergone the rigorous scrutiny given to research published in medical journals. ""The most urgent need for innovative strategies to control blood pressure is in low- and middle-income countries,"" Webster said. ""The triple pill approach is an opportunity to 'leapfrog' over traditional approaches to care and adopt an innovative approach that has been shown to be effective."" High blood pressure increases the risk for heart attack, stroke and kidney problems. ""A control rate of 70 percent would be a considerable improvement, even in high-income settings,"" Webster said. ""Most hypertension guidelines in these countries do not recommend combination blood-pressure-lowering therapy for initial treatment in all people."" The findings, she said, ""should prompt reconsideration of recommendations around the use of combination therapy.""

"Story highlights The test looks for elevated levels of two proteins after brain injury There are about 2.8 million concussion-related hospital visits every year (CNN) The US Food and Drug Administration has, for the first time, approved a blood test to help detect concussion in adults. The Brain Trauma Indicator test measures two biomarkers: proteins known as UCH-L1 and GFAP that are released upon injury to the brain and pass through the blood-brain barrier. Elevated levels of the proteins can be detected within 15 or 20 minutes of injury. The test can be taken within 12 hours of injury, and results can be obtained within three or four hours. Patients are currently diagnosed with concussion based on a combination of symptoms as well as imaging. However, CT scans don't always detect concussion. ""Over 90% of CT scans (for concussion) are negative. And you get 200 times the radiation of a chest X-ray. It's expensive; it's not terrific,"" said Hank Nordhoff, chairman and CEO of Banyan Biomarkers, maker of the new test. It can help determine whether a patient further needs a CT scan, based on a physician's concerns.

"""Remarkable"" -- that's how researchers are describing the results of a new study done on mice displaying traits associated with Alzheimer's disease. The deletion of just a single enzyme saw the near total reversal of the deposition of amyloid plaques found in brains of those with Alzheimer's, improving cognitive functions in the mouse subjects, according to the study from researchers at the Cleveland Clinic, published Feb. 14 in the Journal of Experimental Medicine. These promising research findings center around deleting a gene that produces an enzyme called BACE1, which helps make the beta-amyloid peptides that accumulate abnormally in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. Studies have shown that stopping or reducing that enzyme's activity dramatically reduces production of beta-amyloid peptides, which are toxic to the brain and lead to the symptoms -- including memory loss -- associated with Alzheimer's. By using BACE1 inhibitors to gradually lower the enzyme's levels, researchers saw reduced neuron loss and better brain function in the mice, offering hope for human subjects down the line, according to the study. Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research via Journal of Experimental Medicine However, researchers urge caution with the results as many Alzheimer's discoveries seem to hold true in mice, then fail in people. Cleveland Clinic researcher Riqiang Yan, Ph.D., an author on the study, told ABC News that in the mouse model, the gene that produces the enzyme was deleted, completely stopping the enzyme's production. But in humans, it's unlikely that BACE1 inhibitors would totally halt the enzyme's production, Yan said. Nonetheless, five BACE1 inhibitors are being tested in human subjects currently, Yan added. ""BACE1 inhibitors are still hopeful for AD patients if they have no unwanted side effects or can be tolerated for long-term use,"" Yan said. Yan added researchers are currently in phase II and, in some cases, phase III clinical trials for the various compounds.

"En Español MONDAY, Feb. 12, 2018 (HealthDay News) -- As a particularly nasty flu season rages across the United States, scientists have found a powerful new disinfectant that makes ""light"" work of the virus. Researchers say a certain spectrum of ultraviolet light -- called far-UVC -- easily kills airborne flu viruses while posing no risk to people. It could offer a new, inexpensive way to eliminate airborne flu viruses in indoor public spaces such as hospitals, doctors' offices, schools, airports and aircraft, said the team from Columbia University Medical Center in New York City. The disinfecting success of initial experiments still need to be confirmed, said lead research David Brenner. But he believes ""the use of overhead, low-level far-UVC light in public locations would be a safe and efficient method for limiting the transmission and spread of airborne-mediated microbial diseases, such as influenza and tuberculosis."" As the researchers explained, broad-spectrum UVC light kills viruses and bacteria, and it is currently used to decontaminate surgical equipment. But this type of light can cause skin cancer and cataracts, so it's not used in public spaces. However, Brenner and his colleagues wondered if a much narrower spectrum of ultraviolet light, far-UVC, might be a safer option. In prior studies, they found that far-UVC light killed methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) bacteria -- a common and dangerous ""superbug"" -- without harming human or mouse skin. In this new study, they found that far-UVC light also killed airborne H1N1 virus, a common strain of flu virus. ""Far-UVC light has a very limited range and cannot penetrate through the outer dead-cell layer of human skin or the tear layer in the eye, so it's not a human health hazard,"" said Brenner, who directs Columbia's Center for Radiological Research. However, ""because viruses and bacteria are much smaller than human cells, far-UVC light can reach their DNA and kill them,"" he said in a university news release. Lamps with this type of UV light currently cost less than $1,000, Brenner said, but that price would likely fall if the lamps were mass-produced. ""And unlike flu vaccines, far-UVC is likely to be effective against all airborne microbes, even newly emerging strains,"" he said. Two flu experts were encouraged by the findings. ""The prospect of reducing the transmission of influenza and other respiratory viruses using far-UV radiation is very exciting,"" said Dr. Michael Grosso, chief medical officer at Huntington Hospital in Huntington, N.Y. ""Though hand-washing remains critically important, it does not prevent every instance of transmission,"" Grosso said. ""Immunization and antiviral medications are also important, but again, have limitations. It appears that low-dose far-UV light is safe and effective, and has the advantage of inactivating a wide range of disease-causing viruses."" Dr. Len Horovitz, a pulmonary specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, agreed. He noted that the technology's cost ""is not prohibitive, and it is safe. This use can sterilize the air in a public space, reducing the spread of respiratory droplets containing flu viruses and other bacteria and viruses."" The findings were published online Feb. 9 in the journal Scientific Reports. More information The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has more on flu.",0,story_reviews_00111
"A treatment is offering hope for millions of patients with sleep apnea, a disorder that causes people to stop breathing when they're asleep. An estimated 22 million Americans suffer from sleep apnea, putting them at greater risk for diabetes, heart disease, stroke and memory loss. Patients who are older, overweight and male are generally most at-risk, reports CBS News correspondent David Begnaud. ""I wasn't breathin'. I wasn't getting the correct amount of oxygen. My thought process had gone,"" said Peggy Siravo. Her memory got so bad, her family thought she had dementia. Exhausted, the 59-year-old could barely do her job as a nurse – and she knew something wasn't right. ""I knew I was in trouble,"" Siravo said. Siravo has severe obstructive sleep apnea, where her throat muscles relax, blocking her airway and disrupting her sleep. On average, she stops breathing 53 times an hour, that's nearly once every minute during a night's sleep. She said on a night, she could be up four hours and sleep two. She did not find relief from the CPAP machine, a common treatment that delivers constant pressurized air. She even needed oxygen on top of that. ""And then that didn't work. That's when they introduced me to Inspire and saved my life,"" Siravo said. ""Inspire"" is an FDA-approved pacemaker-like device implanted in the chest. It senses when breathing slows down and sends an electrical pulse to the tongue to stimulate it forward, keeping the airway open. ""This has been revolutionary. It's been a game changer,"" Dr. Maurits Boon said. He is Siravo's doctor at Thomas Jefferson University Hospital in Philadelphia. ""She'd given up. And she had memory issues, she was miserable,"" Boon said. ""This is not a benign disease… it actually shortens people's lives."" A few months after having the Inspire device implanted, Siravo went to a sleep lab to see how it was working. They ran tests throughout the night. Early the next morning, Boon revealed the results. ""So before we activated the device, we have all sorts of problems… This is basically your brain saying, 'I'm not breathing.' … And after we activate the device it's perfect,"" Boon explained. ""Look at your oxygen. Nice, stable, flat line, staying around 96-97 percent. So this is good as it gets."" ""Okay,"" Siravo said. ""And as far as I'm concerned, this is a cure. This is awesome,"" Boon said. A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine found that 68 percent of patients experienced less sleep apnea after getting the implant. For years, all Siravo and her husband, David, wanted was a good night's rest – and now they're finally getting it. Every night, Siravo turns on the implant before heading to bed. ""What's it like to sleep now?"" Begnaud asked. ""Great. Turn myself on. I go to sleep,"" Siravo said. ""And then I get up. And I turn myself off. And I have a normal day like you and everybody else."" ""Doesn't work for everybody. But man, it worked for you,"" Begnaud said. ""It sure did. It saved my life,"" Siravo said. Inspire is not for everyone. It's only for moderate to severe cases, and like any surgery, there is risk of infection. For Siravo, she said her memory is back to 100 percent. The device costs around $20,000 not including the surgery.",1,story_reviews_00118
"Type 2 diabetes is a chronic condition that affects 422 million people worldwide. For decades, doctors have treated it with medications designed to keep blood sugar levels down. But in a paper published in the Lancet, researchers in the UK describe a landmark study in which people with diabetes went into remission—just by losing weight. Nearly half of people in the study who were given a six-month diet plan and lost an average of 30 pounds went into remission and no longer had diabetes. None took any medications during that time to control their disease and relied on weight loss alone. Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now Type 2 diabetes is caused by the body's in ability to break down sugars from the diet. Normally, cells in the pancreas work to release insulin, a hormone that can process sugar and either send it to cells that need it for energy or store it as fat for future energy needs. Cells in the liver are responsible for clearing insulin from the circulation. But excess fat in the pancreas and liver can start to shut down these insulin-producing cells, leading to spikes in blood sugar levels. Diabetes medications can bring sugar levels down but do not address the compromised insulin machinery. In the study, Dr. Roy Taylor, professor of medicine and metabolism at Newcastle University, and his colleagues randomly assigned nearly 300 people to either a weight management program or their usual treatments, including diabetes medications. All of the people had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in the six years preceding the study. The people assigned to the diet group stopped any diabetes drugs they were taking on the same day they began the diet. The diet, which was designed to help people lose up to 30 pounds, involved three to five months of a strict low-calorie liquid formula diet averaging no more than 850 calories a day, followed by two to eight weeks of reintroducing food, along with nutritional education and cognitive behavioral therapy to help people stick with the new eating plan. Taylor and his team tracked outcomes including weight loss, diabetes remission and level of fat in the pancreas and liver. After a year, most of the people in the diet group lost about 22 pounds, compared to two pounds in the control group. Nearly a quarter of the people who managed their weight were able to lose 33 pounds or more, while none in the control group were able to lose that much. Most importantly, 46% of the people in the diet group went into remission with their diabetes, compared to just 4% in the control group. MORE: Antibiotics Are Linked To Type-2 Diabetes ""People newly diagnosed with diabetes for the first time can look at this and know it isn't necessarily for life,"" says Taylor. ""It isn't an irreversible, inexorable condition that you can never escape from — at the moment, people are told that."" Previous studies have suggested that lifestyle changes, including diet and exercise, can be powerful ways to lose weight and combat diabetes. The Diabetes Prevention Program in the U.S. revealed in 2002 that diet and exercise alone can prevent people from progressing from pre-diabetes to diabetes, in some cases better than medications designed to control blood sugar. Gastric bypass surgery, which can result in dramatic weight loss, can also help to reverse diabetes, but the procedure is costly and carries a high risk of complications. The current study takes that work a step further and shows that it's possible to actually reverse the disease in people who have been diagnosed. Taylor stresses that the study only addressed people diagnosed relatively recently — within the past six years — and that the effect may not apply to more long-term patients. That's because as the disease continues, he says, insulin-producing cells start to die off. Initially, the cells slowly shut down, entering a so-called resting state. Those are the cells that weight loss can re-activate. Get The Brief. Sign up to receive the top stories you need to know right now.

But left in this state too long, the cells eventually die and cannot be revived. Studies suggest that people living with diabetes for more than 10 years, for example, may not be able to rely on weight loss alone to push them into remission. That points to an important lesson that Taylor hopes doctors and patients will learn from the results. He says that it's critical to discuss from the start — when people are diagnosed with diabetes — the possibility of using diet and weight loss to treat their disease. If more people can benefit from losing weight alone, then that would mean less cost to the health care system, as fewer people will suffer the serious complications of advanced disease, which can include heart problems, neuropathy, vision issues and even amputations. Taylor says he intends to follow up on the people in the study for another four years to see if they are able to maintain their weight, and, if they are, whether they continue to remain in remission. ""From the very clear data we produced in this trial, yes, this is a watershed moment for diabetes,"" he says. ""We can offer people hope from the start.""

"A Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington for a delicate operation: replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery. A small but growing number of hospitals offer the procedure. See photos. WASHINGTON (AP) — Breast cancer treatment left Susan Wolfe-Tank with an arm too painfully swollen to lift anything heavy or even fit into her usual clothing — a debilitating condition that gets little attention and has no cure. Desperate, the Wisconsin woman traveled hundreds of miles to seek a delicate operation — replacing under-arm lymph nodes lost in cancer surgery — as a small but growing number of hospitals offer microsurgical attempts at relief from lymphedema that help some patients but not all. ""Right in this area, feel that — that is your lymph node,"" Dr. David Song of MedStar Georgetown University Hospital in Washington told Wolfe-Tank during a recent check-up. Song, Georgetown's plastic surgery chief, had removed healthy lymph nodes from Wolfe-Tank's back and side and implanted them in the affected arm. As the new nodes took root, her arm was shrinking. A delighted Song's only caution: ""Take care of them,"" by wearing a compression sleeve as prescribed. ""This isn't a cure. I will still have to be careful,"" said Wolfe-Tank, 51, of Hurley, Wisconsin. But, ""I will be able to cross-country ski again, just live a normal life. Look at my arm, it's incredible."" Lymphedema is a chronic swelling, often in an arm or leg, that in severe cases can be disfiguring, impair mobility, cause disabling pain, harden the skin and lead to infection. Lymph nodes work like biological pumps in a network that's part of the immune system. They drain watery fluid called lymph that, traveling through tiny channels, brings nutrients to cells and takes away bacteria and waste material. Lose or damage enough lymph nodes or channels in a particular area and that fluid builds up. There's no good count, but millions of Americans are estimated to have some degree of lymphedema, and while it can be hereditary or result from injury, many U.S. cases are a lasting side effect of treatment for a variety of cancers. Consider breast cancer. While better surgical techniques in recent decades have lowered the risk, experts estimate that still about 6 percent of breast cancer survivors who undergo a ""sentinel node biopsy"" — removing a few nodes to check for spreading cancer — will develop lymphedema. That risk jumps to about 20 percent for women like Wolfe-Tank who need additional lymph nodes removed because of more advanced cancer. Radiation causes further harm. Yet too often women aren't warned about symptoms or checked for early signs, when lymphedema is more easily treated, said Dr. Sheldon Feldman of New York's Montefiore Einstein Center for Cancer Care. He co-authored physician guidelines issued this fall by the American Society of Breast Surgeons on prevention and treatment of breast cancer-related lymphedema. Typical patients have ""had that swelling for a while,"" Feldman said. ""Now the treatment is an uphill battle."" The main treatment consists of wearing compression bandages and massage to bring down swelling. A lymphedema specialist initially prescribed a large pump that massaged Wolfe-Tank's arm for an hour a night, temporarily relieving some of the pain. ""But if I used my arm, I was back to square one,"" Wolfe-Tank said. ""I didn't fit into my coat anymore. I live in the snow capital of Wisconsin. I'm not supposed to shovel. We've got to fix this."" Wolfe-Tank had struggled for four years when an oncologist recommended lymph node transfer. The rationale: There are more lymph nodes in the body's trunk than in the limbs — more avenues to drain off fluid — and thus it should be safe to move a few. Hunting for a surgeon, Wolfe-Tank found Song, who transferred about five nodes along with supportive blood vessels and other tissue, hoping they'd grow new channels to drain fluid. It's not the only option. A technique called lymphovenous bypass reroutes lymph-carrying channels, going around damaged or missing nodes to drain into veins instead. Some surgeons use a variation of that technique protectively, in hopes of preventing lymphedema from forming in the first place. During the initial cancer surgery, they check which lymph-carrying channels the node removal left dangling — and connect them to blood vessels to drain. ""Surgical options offer great potential,"" note the breast surgeons' new guidelines. But they don't work for everyone. About a third of lymph node transfer patients see some positive effect, Song said. And Feldman noted that over about the past decade, the microsurgeries have been studied only in small research trials, and results vary with surgeon experience. One debate is whether to offer lymph node transfer early, before patients build up as much damage as Wolfe-Tank did. Insurance coverage also varies. Feldman's bottom line: Patients considering microsurgery should be evaluated in a comprehensive lymphedema program to determine their best options. Copyright © 2018 The Associated Press.

"For the first time, doctors have used gene therapy to stave off a fatal degenerative brain disease, an achievement that some experts had thought impossible. The key to making the therapy work? One of medicine's greatest villains: HIV. The patients were children who had inherited a mutated gene causing a rare disorder, adrenoleukodystrophy, or ALD. Nerve cells in the brain die, and in a few short years, children lose the ability to walk or talk. They become unable to eat without a feeding tube, to see, hear or think. They usually die within five years of diagnosis. The disease strikes about one in 20,000 boys; symptoms first occur at an average age of 7. The only treatment is a bone-marrow transplant — if a compatible donor can be found — or a transplant with cord blood, if it was saved at birth.",0,story_reviews_00160

"(CNN) The headlines about football players and chronic traumatic encephalopathy - commonly known as CTE - seem endless. The most recent diagnosis of the neurodegenerative brain disease was given to former New England Patriot Aaron Hernandez. But one of the biggest obstacles in understanding CTE has been the inability to diagnose it in the living. New research released Tuesday may make that possible. Published in the journal PLOS One, researchers have found a protein that can be a marker of this devastating disease. ""This is something new,"" said Dr. Ann McKee , a neuropathologist and senior author of the studyMcKee has performed many of the high profile diagnoses of CTE among former pro-football players and is director of the Boston University CTE Center. An early step in the right direction McKee also cautioned that this is still early research. ""The next step -- is repeating, validating our findings, and seeing if we can detect it in blood, and of course doing it in living subjects. These are critical next steps,"" she said. CTE causes Alzheimer's-like symptoms, including memory loss, confusion, aggression, rage and, at times, suicidal behavior. It is believed to result from repeated trauma to the head, which causes a buildup of the abnormal protein tau which clumps in the brain. In this new study, researchers found an increased amount of the protein CCL11 in patients previously diagnosed with CTE. CCL11 is a protein commonly associated with inflammation, a process which McKee said can be a trigger for the disease. ""Inflammation is normally a very helpful response in the brain, but when it goes on and persists for a long time, and gets out of control -- that's what we think happens in CTE,"" said McKee. More exposure to football increases likeliness of CCL11 The paper evaluated the brains of 23 deceased football players with CTE, and compared them to the brains of 50 deceased people diagnosed with Alzheimer's disease and the brains of 18 deceased non-athletes. When compared to the brains without CTE, researchers found those brains with CTE had significantly higher amounts of CCL11, even when compared to those brains with Alzheimer's, another degenerative brain disease. Furthermore, they found that the more years someone played football, the higher amount of the protein. However, contrary to the popularly held belief that a greater number of concussions are linked to CTE , no connection was found between levels of CCL11 and reported number of concussions. In addition, the number of reported concussions tend to be an unreliable indicator in general, because they are usually self reported. Although there are different stages of the disease that indicate how far it has progressed, this study was unable to determine any connections between levels of CCL11 and severity of CTE. ""The findings of this study are the early steps toward identifying CTE during life. Once we can successfully diagnose CTE in living individuals, we will be much closer to discovering treatments for those who suffer from it,"" said McKee. ""It is a good step forward but I will be very conservative about the interpretations of the possible application to diagnosis,"" said Dr. Bennet Omalu, the neuropathologist credited with making the first diagnosis of CTE among professional football players. Omalu found traces of the disease in the brain of legendary Pittsburgh Steelers player and pro Hall of Famer Mike Webster in 2002. While Omalu was cautiously optimistic about the development, he also noted that CCL11 isn't unique to the brain disease. ""This is an inflammatory marker that may be non-specific and may not be diagnostic of CTE,"" he said. While it is hoped that this will be one avenue to help detect the disease in the living, McKee believes that it will just be one part of a larger process. ""This may be one of the abnormalities [of the disease], but it may take 2-3 to be useful to diagnose CTE,"" said McKee. imaging. Previous studies have evaluated other potential biomarkers for CTE, including identifying the protein tau using brainimaging. 110 of 111 former NFL players found with CTE A recent analysis by BU found evidence of CTE in 110 of 111 brains of former NFL players. However, there is a potential bias in that study, as relatives of these players may have submitted their brains for diagnosis due to clinical symptoms noticed while the players were alive. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter. CTE has been detected in veterans, as well as players of other contact sports; however, it has become most associated with football. Along with Hernandez, CTE has been diagnosed in San Diego Charger and Hall of Famer Junior Seau, as well as the Philadelphia Eagles' Kevin Turner and the Oakland Raiders' Ken Stabler, to name a few. In 2015, a federal judge approved a class-action lawsuit settlement between the NFL and thousands of former players who accused the league of hiding the dangers of concussions and repeated head trauma. The agreement provides up to $5 million per retired player for serious medical conditions associated with repeated head trauma.",0,story_reviews_00165
"(Reuters Health) - Women who take hormone replacement therapy (HRT) to ease menopause symptoms like hot flashes and night sweats may be no more likely to die prematurely than women who don't take hormones, a new study suggests. Many women have been reluctant to use hormones for menopause symptoms since 2002, when the federally funded Women's Health Initiative (WHI) study linked the treatments containing man-made versions of the female hormones estrogen and progestin to an increased risk of breast cancer, heart attacks and strokes. The current study, however, looked at longer-term data from the WHI study and found no increased risk of death from all causes, or from cancer or cardiovascular issues in particular, associated with hormone use. ""Women seeking treatment for distressing hot flashes, night sweats or other menopausal symptoms may find the mortality results reassuring,"" said lead study author Dr. JoAnn Manson of Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Women go through menopause when they stop menstruating, typically between ages 45 and 55. As the ovaries curb production of the hormones estrogen and progesterone in the years leading up to menopause and afterward, women can experience symptoms ranging from irregular periods and vaginal dryness to mood swings and insomnia. For the study, researchers looked at data on 27,347 women ages 50 to 79 who joined two WHI trials between 1993 and 1998 and were followed through 2014. One trial tested estrogen alone against a placebo, or dummy pill, while the other trial tested estrogen taken in combination with progestin. Women were 63 years old on average when they joined the trials and had already gone through menopause. They took hormones or a placebo for five to seven years and were followed for a total of 18 years altogether. During the study period, 7,489 women died. Death rates were similar - at about 27 percent - among women who took hormones and women who didn't, researchers report in JAMA. Younger women in the study appeared to have better survival odds with HRT. Over the initial five to seven years when women were randomly assigned to take hormones or a placebo, death rates were about 30 percent lower among women aged 50 to 59 when they took HRT than when they didn't. For women who started hormones in their 60s or 70s, however, there wasn't a meaningful difference in death rates according to whether they got the treatment or a placebo during the initial years of the study. After 18 years, including both the treatment period and a decade or more of follow-up, women's age when they joined the study no longer appeared to significantly influence death rates. One limitation of the study is that the WHI didn't look at different dosages of hormone pills, and the findings may be different for other dosages or different types of therapy such as gels or creams or skin patches. Still, the current study should ease concerns raised by earlier results from the WHI trials that an increased risk of breast cancer or heart attacks might translate into higher long-term mortality rates, said Dr. Melissa McNeil, author of an accompanying editorial and a women's health researcher at the University of Pittsburgh. Taking a combination of estrogen and progestin is associated with an increased risk of breast cancer, but advances in screening and treatment since the WHI started now mean these tumors are unlikely to be fatal, McNeil said by email. With additional years of follow-up, it also appears that the increased heart attack risk associated with HRT in the initial results from the WHI trials is limited to older women, McNeil added. ""Hormone therapy has been in and out of favor - first it was good for all menopausal women, then it was dangerous for all women,"" McNeil said. ""The take-home message now is that for the right patient, hormone therapy is safe and effective."" SOURCE: bit.ly/2jkqUFE and bit.ly/2jo0piX JAMA, online September 12, 2017.",0,story_reviews_00172
"After years of growing doubt about the value of screening men for prostate cancer, a new analysis of existing clinical trial evidence has found that when men between 55 and 70 get the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test, the result is lives saved. In 2009, a New England Journal of Medicine editorialist famously called the debate over PSA testing for prostate cancer ""the controversy that refuses to die."" That comment came with the publication of two clinical trials — one conducted in the United States, the second in Europe — that drew two contradictory conclusions on prostate cancer testing. The U.S. undertaking, called the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian Cancer Screening (PLCO) Trial, found that screening men for prostate cancer does not save lives. The European Randomized Study of Screening for Prostate Cancer suggested that screening drove down the rate of deaths from prostate cancer by 20%. In 2012, a federally funded panel of experts on preventive care concluded there are more risks than benefits to screening American men for prostate cancer with the PSA test. And in April 2017, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force dumped the decision squarely into the laps of patients and their doctors. Some men between 55 and 69 years of age might well decide to get their PSA checked, the task force said. After hearing the ledger of pros and cons, however, others in that age bracket might just as reasonably skip the screening test, the panel concluded. Advertisement The new research, published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine, now calls those recommendations into question. The authors of the study, led by biostatistician Ruth Etzioni of Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, concluded that screening men over age 55 ""can signiﬁcantly reduce the risk for prostate cancer death."" When men who fit the criteria for screening get the PSA test, the reduction in deaths due to prostate cancer was between 25% and 32%, the new study found. But the newly published analysis also underscores that the value of prostate cancer screening rests heavily on which men you screen, where and for how long you conduct the clinical trial, and how you crunch the numbers. In the end, said Vanderbilt University urological surgeon Dr. Sam Chang, the new analysis ""reinforces what urological surgeons and treating physicians have thought all along: that PSA screening is helpful."" Advertisement But it is helpful, said Chang, only when it focuses on the right men — those between 55 and 70 — and when it is tempered by an understanding that not all worrisome findings are evidence of disease that should be treated aggressively. Sometimes, said Chang, who was not involved in the newly published article, a man will get a problematic PSA test reading and decide not to act on it immediately or aggressively. But knowing there is a decision to be made is probably a better basis for planning than not knowing, he added. ""Over the past five to 10 years, there has been a better understanding by everyone about the harms of over-treatment,"" Chang said. ""You want to avoid over-diagnosis and over-treatment."" Chang underscored that for two groups in particular — African American men and those with a first-degree relative who died of prostate cancer — knowing is especially important, because the risks of aggressive disease in such populations is much higher than for others. Neither group was the subject of special attention in the newly published analysis. In an editorial published alongside the new analysis, Andrew Vickers of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center also made clear that it's what patients and their physicians do after the PSA test that matters most. ""Unfortunately, the way screening has been implemented in the United States leaves much to be desired,"" Vickers wrote. ""The controversy about PSA-based screening should no longer be whether it can do good but whether we can change our behavior so that it does more good than harm,"" he added. Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer found in men, affecting 101.6 of 100,000 American men, according to the Centers for Disease Control & Prevention. In 2013, the latest year for which figures are available, 176,000 got a diagnosis of prostate cancer and 28,000 died of it. But a change in a man's reading on the PSA test is a highly imperfect gauge of trouble: approximately 80% of positive PSA test results are thought to produce false-positives, creating scares that prompt men to get biopsies. And treatment, which carries with it a high risk of subsequent difficulties with sexual function, urination and bowel movements, is often unnecessary because prostate cancers are often so slow-growing they will never make a man sick. Advertisement As a result of this growing skepticism about whom to screen for prostate cancer and whether to treat it, more and more men are skipping the PSA test. And among those who get it and get back a worrisome finding, fewer and fewer are opting to treat it. Earlier this year, a long-running clinical trial found no evidence that patients who got an early prostate cancer diagnosis and chose ""active surveillance"" (sometimes called watchful waiting) were no more likely to die of the disease than were men who got the same diagnosis and treated it aggressively. melissa.healy@latimes.com @LATMelissaHealy",0,story_reviews_00177
"It turns out that cholesterol isn't the only thing you have to worry about to keep your heart healthy. In recent years, doctors have started to focus on inflammation — the same process that makes cuts red and painful — as an important contributor to a heart attack. It's the reason doctors recommend low-dose aspirin to prevent recurrent heart attacks in people who have already had them, why they also prescribe statins, which lower both cholesterol and inflammation, and why they have started to measure inflammation levels in the blood. But it's never been clear exactly how much inflammation adds to heart disease risk. Since statins lower both, it's hard to tell whether inflammation or cholesterol has the bigger impact on heart problems. MORE: Why Inflammation in Your Mouth May Raise Your Risk of Cancer But in a new paper published in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at the European Society of Cardiology meeting, scientists say they now have proof that lowering inflammation alone, without affecting cholesterol, also reduces the risk of a heart attack. In the study, 10,000 people who have already had a heart attack were randomly assigned to get injected with a placebo or different doses of a drug called canakinumab. Canakinumab, made by Novartis, is currently approved to treat rare immune-related conditions and works to reduce inflammation but does not affect cholesterol levels. After four years, the people who received the drug had a 15% lower chance of having a heart attack or stroke compared to people who didn't get the drug. The medication also reduced the need for angioplasty or bypass surgery by 30%. ""Even I am pinching myself,"" says Dr. Paul Ridker, who led the study and is director of the center for cardiovascular disease prevention at Brigham and Women's Hospital and is a pioneer in exposing the role inflammation plays in heart disease. ""This outcome is more than we hoped for. The bottom line is we now have clear evidence that lowering inflammation through this pathway lowers rates of heart attack and stroke with no change at all in cholesterol."" About a quarter of people who have heart attacks will have another heart event even if they keep their cholesterol at recommended levels. For them, it may not be cholesterol so much as inflammation that is driving their heart disease. So the study further solidifies the fact that heart doctors should be measure inflammation as well as cholesterol in their heart patients. An inexpensive blood test that looks for a protein that rises in the blood with inflammation, called C-reactive protein (CRP), can tell doctors how much inflammation their patients have. Beginning in 2003, the American Heart Association started to provide guidelines on how doctors should use CRP testing; for patients like those in the current trial, the group did not see any additional benefit to CRP testing since those patients should already be treated with statins, which can lower both cholesterol and inflammation.

But with the new results, those guidelines may change. Ridker says the findings should clarify how doctors can optimize the way they treat their heart patients — about half of people who have had a heart attack tend to have high levels of inflammatory factors, while half have high cholesterol levels. The inexpensive CRP test could identify those with higher inflammation, who might be candidates for taking a drug like canakinumab. The drug is not currently approved for any heart conditions, but Novartis will likely look at doing more studies to confirm its effectiveness in treating heart disease. Perhaps more intriguing are additional results that Ridker reported, related to cancer. In a separate study published in the Lancet using data from the same study, he found that people taking canakinumab lowered their risk of dying from any cancer over four years by 50%, and their risk of fatal lung cancer by 75%. While the connection between heart disease and cancer may not seem obvious, Ridker says that many people who have had heart problems, like those in the study, are former or current smokers, since smoking is a risk factor for heart attacks. And smoking increases inflammation. ""People who smoke a pack of cigarettes a day are chronically inflaming their lungs,"" he says. That's why he decided to look at cancer deaths as well as heart events in his study population. The cancer data is still preliminary, and needs to be confirmed with additional studies, but it's encouraging, says Dr. Otis Bradley, chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society, who was not involved in the study. ""We know that free oxygen radicals and inflammation can damage DNA and can cause cancer,"" he says. ""This all makes sense to me."" Studies have already shown, for example, that inflammation may be a factor in prostate cancer and colon cancer. But whether anti-inflammatory agents, like canakinumab, or even over-the-counter drugs like aspirin, should be part of standard cancer treatment isn't clear yet. There are a number of different inflammatory pathways, and canakinumab targets just one. Other pathways, along with new anti-inflammatory drugs, may emerge with more research. When it comes to heart disease, however, it's clear that inflammation-fighting medications like canakinumb may represent the next generation of treatment. ""Ten years from now we will be doing more personalized medicine,"" says Ridker. ""Some people will get more cholesterol lowering. Some will get more inflammation-lowering drugs. Some will get other agents that we haven't considered yet. It's a wonderful new era in heart disease treatment."" Contact us at editors@time.com.",0,story_reviews_00180
"When Heidi Imhof started losing her hair at 42, she also started losing sleep. Ms. Imhof, a lawyer, was afraid that blow-drying her straight dark hair would hasten the shedding, so she got up two hours early to shower and apply mousse and volumizers.

"""Take charge of your biological clock,"" the invitation urged. It beckoned women to an evening seminar in Manhattan. There, they received a coupon for the latest in fertility management: a genetic test marketed as a way to help maximize their chances of becoming pregnant. The hitch: Top reproductive endocrinologists point out that there's no evidence the $950 DNA test can actually help women conceive. And even the company's founder and CEO acknowledges the test can't provide clear and definitive answers on which treatments women should try next if they're struggling with infertility. advertisement The Fertilome test hit the market at the start of this year and the company behind it, Celmatix, said more than 50 doctors have already ordered it for hundreds of women seeking scientific guidance on questions such as whether they should freeze their eggs for future use, or whether it's worth it to try another round of in vitro fertilization. The Celmatix CEO, Piraye Yurttas Beim, said her team has heard of a small wave of ""Fertilome babies"" on the way. Some reproductive specialists are enthusiastic. But others caution that Fertilome is just the latest genetic test promising more than it can deliver — and, in this case, playing to the fears of women who are anxious about becoming a mother. (Another example: a new $89 test that claims to tell women how their DNA could influence the level of a beneficial fatty acid in their breast milk.) The Fertilome test, which must be ordered by a doctor, analyzes a woman's DNA for 49 genetic variants that have been linked to various conditions that can sometimes cause fertility problems. A couple weeks later, the doctor gets back a long report listing the odds that a patient has certain conditions. For example, she might be 4.4 times more likely than women without a particular genetic variant to have a condition known as primary ovarian insufficiency, characterized by irregular periods and diminished fertility before age 40. That sounds alarming, and might prompt a younger woman who's planning to delay pregnancy to freeze her eggs to be sure she has them available down the road. But the report does not explain that the condition is fairly rare — affecting just 1 in 1,000 women by age 30 and 1 in 250 women by age 35 — so the absolute risk is still very small. The $950 Fertilome test must be ordered by a doctor and requires women to get their blood drawn. Celmatix And just because women have an elevated genetic risk for a condition doesn't mean they actually have it. Many of the other conditions that the test screens for are also quite rare. But the report doesn't explain the prevalence. So a patient may see a table showing that her genetic variants make her twice as likely to have a condition known as recurrent pregnancy loss, defined as repeated miscarriages. But the report doesn't note that just 1 percent of women have that condition in the first place, making the odds still overwhelmingly in her favor. The doctor ordering the test, or a genetic counselor, is supposed to provide that information. Without the proper context, ""some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients,"" said Dr. John Petrozza, chief of the division of reproductive medicine at Massachusetts General Hospital. Petrozza said he worries that women might wrongly interpret a long litany of genetic risks to mean that their hopes to start a family are ""doomed."" He also said he sees the test as ""very costly for what it's trying to do — and not really giving, at least at this point, what I would consider meaningful information."" Tapping into women's anxieties The Fertilome test was eight years in the making. It draws on more than 5,000 studies that have found associations between particular genetic variants and conditions that can cause fertility problems, company spokeswoman Colleen McMillen said. Beim, the Celmatix CEO, said the test is already bringing ""tremendous"" value, in part by providing guidance that can act as a ""tiebreaker"" to help patients and their doctor decide which treatment to prioritize. ""It will help save a lot of heartache and time if we could know from the very beginning that [a given patient] is at risk for a uterine factor, or if it's more her eggs,"" said Dr. Angie Beltsos, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in Chicago who ordered the Fertilome test for one of her patients for the first time last month. What the test can't do: provide evidence-backed answers on what patients should try next. Nor can it tell patients whether they're wired to get pregnant from IVF — or wired to fail it. ""We're not there. We're not claiming we're there,"" Beim said. Beim trained as a molecular genetics researcher. As a Ph.D. student at Weill Cornell in the 2000s, she worked on an early project in what's now called precision medicine: identifying the specific genetic alterations in the tumors of lung cancer patients that seemed to predict whether they would respond to a certain drug. After shifting her research focus to embryology, Beim found herself frustrated that the fertility field wasn't benefiting from the same boom in translational genetics that was reshaping oncology. So she started her own company. Celmatix also sells software, called Polaris, that pulls from the medical histories of hundreds of thousands of women to try to predict which fertility treatments are likely to work in different circumstances. ""Some of this can be very misleading and very frightening to patients."" Dr. John Petrozza, fertility specialist Fertilome — not to be confused with a line of weed killers and other gardening products with the same name — launched in January with a $1,900 price tag. Insurers don't cover it; after it became clear that patients were balking at the bill, Celmatix cut the price in half. Celmatix is mostly marketing the test to reproductive specialists, who are largely using it in the toughest infertility cases, Beim said. But the company is also beginning to market directly to women — including younger women who aren't trying to get pregnant yet. The company has recently started promoting social media ads, like one that asks: ""Are you getting the right fertility treatments for your DNA?"" Another asserts: ""Over 60% of millennial women are open to #eggfreezing. The Fertilome test can help you decide if it is right for you."" The company's website also features testimonials from women who say they have used Fertilome to help guide their decisions. There's Ella, a 30-year-old with dark hair and stylish clothing who decided to freeze her eggs after taking the Fertilome test. Then there's Maxine, a 27-year-old medical school graduate with short hair and a warm smile who used the test to help her juggle the timing of starting a family and starting her career. The wrinkle: The images of Ella and Maxine are actually stock photos, available for purchase online. After questions from STAT, the company added a disclaimer acknowledging that testimonials are not quite as they were promoted from the start: the names, images, and details of patients' stories have been changed to safeguard their privacy. Along with its social media outreach, Celmatix has held several after-work events for New York City-area women. It hosted one, on a Wednesday night in April, in its offices on Wall Street. An ad beckons women to a seminar to learn about ""proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals."" And on a Tuesday evening earlier this summer, the company partnered with a women's group to host a conversation about ""proactive steps you can take today to reach your future family building goals."" Appetizers, wine, and beer were served — and, in a gesture to the crowd full of women with pregnancy on their minds, non-alcoholic beverages were on the menu, too. The company is also trying to reach OB-GYNs whose patients aren't yet trying to get pregnant — or may be just beginning to try. Celmatix held webinars earlier this summer for OB-GYNs, telling them that the test could help ""optimize management plans from the very start."" DNA analysis points a patient to Walmart for supplements Dr. Aimee Eyvazzadeh, a reproductive endocrinologist in private practice in the Bay Area, is among a few doctors who've been given vouchers by the company to offer the test for $500. She's been ordering the Fertilome test for her patients about five times a week. Eyvazzadeh said the test recently helped her counsel a patient to forgo a third round of IVF, because the patient had a genetic profile that suggested it would be unlikely to work and wasn't in a financial position to gamble on such slim odds. (A round of IVF can cost $13,000.) That patient is now considering an egg donor. Another one of Eyvazzadeh's patients is 31-year-old Tara Smith. Tara Smith and her husband, Nick, have spent the past four years trying to conceive. Courtesy Tara Smith For Smith, who works as a foster parent providing intensive care in Northern California, there's nothing more important than family. She's dreamed of having her own baby since she was a child herself. That's why Smith and her husband have spent about $70,000 over the past four years trying, without success, to get pregnant. They've seen doctors in St. Louis and Las Vegas, taken countless blood tests, and tried two rounds of IVF and several cycles of intrauterine insemination. Smith has long known that she has a condition called polycystic ovary syndrome, which can make it harder to get pregnant, but no one could figure out exactly why none of the treatments were working.

Eyvazzadeh walked her through the results last month before showing her the report, so Smith had an idea of what to expect. Still, Smith said, ""my heart sank"" when she saw her results for the first time. She was 2.88 times more likely to have endometriosis, a painful disorder of the uterus, than a woman without a certain genetic variant. She was 1.54 times more likely to have primary ovarian insufficiency. She also carried three genetic variants that elevated her risk of having recurrent pregnancy loss. And she had 24 additional genetic variants that are more weakly associated with various conditions that can play a role in fertility problems. ""It's gut-wrenching. You're almost like this alien. Nobody knows what's going on, and you can't fix the problem."" Tara Smith, fertility patient Despite it all, Eyvazzadeh had a plan. Because many of Smith's genetic variants were involved in immune response regulation, she instructed Smith to focus on minimizing inflammation. At Eyvazzadeh's recommendation, Smith spent about $200 buying dietary supplements like fish oils, turmeric, cayenne pepper, resveratrol, and berberine from Amazon and Walmart. Smith also embarked on a new diet, cutting out dairy and red meat. (A 2015 review of the evidence on the optimal diet to promote fertility — and the utility of supplements — found the data ""conflicting."") They also plan to have Smith get infusions of intralipids — a cocktail of soy bean oil, egg yolks, and other fatty acids — during her third round of IVF, which she's embarking on now. (Intralipid infusions are increasingly popular, but the practice was found not to help in a 2016 study of older women with a history of miscarriage.) Smith has mostly positive feelings about her Fertilome test. Having a concrete plan based on what's in her DNA gives her a new sense of hope. ""Now I feel like we're armed with information,"" she said. But at the same time, she said, knowing what may be wrong with her makes her apprehensive about whether she'll ever get pregnant. After all, so far, the test has pointed her only to try nutritional tweaks of uncertain value. It doesn't offer any definitive answers. And that's what gives Dr. Valerie Baker pause. A reproductive endocrinologist at Stanford, she recently suggested the test to a patient with longstanding infertility. The patient asked a good question: What would we do differently if we had this genetic analysis? ""I don't know,"" Baker recalled responding. ""I probably wouldn't do anything differently."" She did not end up ordering the test.",0,story_reviews_00192
"Developing a vaccine to stop HIV is thought to be among the most daunting challenges in medicine for one big reason: The virus is extraordinarily genetically diverse, even more so than the flu. So it's difficult to think about how a single shot might work against all the different HIV subtypes circulating around the world. But scientists may be inching toward a vaccine that could tackle HIV's genetic diversity and prevent the virus from taking hold in people. Researchers from the National Institutes of Health and Johnson & Johnson at the International AIDS Society conference in Paris Monday morning presented data on a clinical trial of what's called the ""Ad26-env mosaic vaccine."" The mosaic vaccine was developed using a computer algorithm to analyze HIV data from around the world and select a range of HIV sequences to include in a shot. It's called a ""mosaic"" because it involves taking pieces of different viruses and sticking them together to generate immune responses that can cover a broad range of HIV subtypes. ""One of the great challenges for development of HIV vaccine is viral diversity,"" said Dan Barouch, a lead researcher on the vaccine and director of the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. ""The mosaic strategy is one way to attempt to deal with the global virus diversity."" A word of caution, though: We're only in the early phase of human testing, and the vaccine could ultimately fail to prevent the virus from spreading among people. But so far, the HIV community is carefully watching the Ad26 vaccine research because the approach seems quite promising. The mosaic approach seems promising in very early clinical research In the 35 years of the HIV epidemic, only four HIV vaccine concepts have been tested in humans. The mosaic strategy is the fifth concept, and one of only two HIV vaccines that's currently part of clinical trials of efficacy in humans. (The other is the HVTN 702 HIV vaccine candidate, now underway in Thailand.) In the study of the Ad26 mosaic vaccine, called the APPROACH trial, 393 volunteers in the United States, Rwanda, Uganda, South Africa, and Thailand were randomly assigned to receive one of seven experimental vaccines or a placebo. The mosaic vaccine was the best tolerated and also capable of generating anti-HIV immune responses in all the people who received the shots. Before this, studies of the mosaic vaccine in rhesus monkeys showed a 66 percent efficacy rate, meaning 66 percent of monkeys that got the shot were protected from the virus. (With HIV, 50 to 60 percent is about the efficacy range researchers hope for.) Interestingly, in the early human study, the immune response was comparable to the rhesus monkey one, which gave the researchers hope that the vaccine might be similarly effective in people. We need more human studies of this HIV vaccine But we still don't know if the vaccine will protect humans from the virus, since the studies so far have only looked at safety and immune responses, not efficacy. And many medicines that look promising in animals, and safe in humans, don't pan out in clinical trials focused on efficacy. ""I wouldn't use the word excited too much,"" said Anthony Fauci, director of the NIH's National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. ""It's a step forward toward getting another candidate into trial that could have some promise."" It's too soon to say if and when the mosaic vaccine might work to prevent the virus from spreading in humans, he added. As for next steps, if the researchers continue to see promising data on the mosaic vaccine from another ongoing study, a larger human efficacy trial will move forward toward the end of the year in southern Africa, involving some 2,600 healthy, HIV-negative women. Deaths from AIDS have halved since 2005 — but there's still a ton of work to be done We've made remarkable progress against HIV around the world. In 1996, as HIV prevalence was peaking around the world, the United Nations established UNAIDS, the first global health body focused on a single disease. In 2000, the UN Security Council convened an unprecedented meeting to address the out-of-control AIDS crisis. This led to a massive concentration of resources into HIV/AIDS research, and triggered global and coordinated efforts to stem the disease. Researchers and doctors figured out how to get people tested and diagnosed quickly, and uncovered effective treatments that allowed those with HIV to live long, relatively healthy lives. Public health officials also waged awareness campaigns about prevention, reminding people to practice safe sex with condoms and get tested, and that early HIV treatment can save lives. Recently, researchers even discovered a pill to prevent HIV. Deaths from AIDS have halved to 1 million since 2005, and UNAIDS estimates almost 20 million people now have access to treatment. (Some of that access is now in jeopardy, however, given that President Donald Trump has proposed cutting $800 million from a key US government AIDS program called PEPFAR in the 2018 budget.) An HIV vaccine has long been elusive. The other HIV vaccine in human testing, the HVTN 702 candidate, is a newer version of the only other HIV vaccine to show any efficacy in humans, called RV144. In a trial on the RV144, 31 percent of people who got the vaccine did not develop HIV — too small a number to be useful. But with the new HVTN trial, researchers hope some tweaks to the vaccine might boost the efficacy rate. ""A safe and effective HIV vaccine would be a powerful tool to reduce new HIV infections worldwide and help bring about a durable end to the HIV/AIDS pandemic,"" Fauci said in a statement. ""By exploring multiple promising avenues of vaccine development research, we expand our opportunities to achieve these goals.""",0,story_reviews_00196
"Emily Whitehead, 12, catches fireflies in her backyard in Philipsburg, Pa. In 2012, Emily was the first child treated with an experimental immunotherapy that is on the verge of approval by the Food and Drug Administration. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post) When doctors saw the report on Bill Ludwig's bone-marrow biopsy, they thought it was a mistake and ordered the test repeated. But the results came back the same: His lethal leukemia had been wiped out by an experimental treatment never before used in humans. ""We were hoping for a little improvement,"" remembered the 72-year-old retired New Jersey corrections officer, who had battled the disease for a decade. He and his oncologist both broke down when she delivered the good news in 2010. ""Nobody was hoping for zero cancer."" The pioneering therapy administered to Ludwig and a few other adults at the University of Pennsylvania hospital paved the way for clinical trials with children. Six-year-old Emily Whitehead, who was near death, became the first pediatric recipient in 2012. Like Ludwig, she remains cancer-free. Such results are why the treatment is on track to become the first gene therapy approved by the Food and Drug Administration. An FDA advisory committee will decide Wednesday whether to recommend approval of the approach, which uses patients' own genetically altered immune cells to fight blood cancers. If the panel gives the nod, the agency probably will follow suit by the end of September. That would open the latest chapter in immunotherapy — ""a true living drug,"" said Penn scientist Carl June, who led its development. Emily and her father, Tom Whitehead, have some ice cream alongside their dog, Lucy. Emily remains cancer-free five years after receiving CAR T-cell therapy. (Sean Simmers for The Washington Post) The CAR T-cell treatment, manufactured by the drug company Novartis, initially would be available only for the small number of children and young adults whose leukemia does not respond to standard care. Those patients typically have a grim prognosis, but in the pivotal trial testing the therapy in almost a dozen countries, 83 percent of patients went into remission. A year later, two-thirds remained so. And childhood leukemia is just the start for a field that has attracted intense interest in academia and industry. Kite Pharma of Santa Monica, Calif., has applied for FDA approval to treat aggressive non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, and a similar Novartis application is close behind. Researchers also are exploring CAR T-cell therapy's use for multiple myeloma and chronic lymphocytic leukemia, the disease that afflicted Ludwig. They are also tackling a far more difficult challenge — using the therapy for solid tumors in the lungs or brain, for example. The excitement among doctors and researchers is palpable. ""We're saving patients who three or four years ago we were at our wit's end trying to keep alive,"" said Stephen Schuster, the Penn oncologist who is leading a Novartis lymphoma study. That study and a Kite trial have shown that the treatment can put about one-third of adults with advanced disease — those who have exhausted all options — into remission. Yet along with the enthusiasm come pressing questions about safety, cost and the complexity of the procedure. It involves extracting white blood cells called T cells — the foot soldiers of the immune system — from a patient's blood, freezing them and sending them to Novartis's sprawling manufacturing plant in Morris Plains, N.J. There, a crippled HIV fragment is used to genetically modify the T cells so they can find and attack the cancer. The cells then are refrozen and sent back to be infused into the patient. Once inside the person's body, the T-cell army multiplies astronomically. Novartis has not disclosed the price for its therapy, but analysts are predicting $300,000 to $600,000 for a one-time infusion. Brad Loncar, whose investment fund focuses on companies that develop immunotherapy treatments, hopes the cost does not prompt a backlash. ""CAR-T is not the EpiPen,"" he said. ""This is truly pushing the envelope and at the cutting edge of science."" The biggest concerns, however, center on safety. The revved-up immune system becomes a potent cancer-fighting agent but also a dangerous threat to the patient. Serious side effects abound, raising concerns about broad use. ""Treating patients safely is the heart of the rollout,"" said Stephan Grupp of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, who as director of the hospital's cancer immunotherapy program led early pediatric studies as well as Novartis's global trial. ""The efficacy takes care of itself, but safety takes a lot of attention."" One of the most common side effects is called cytokine release syndrome, which causes high fever and flulike symptoms that in some cases can be so dangerous that the patient ends up in intensive care. The other major worry is neurotoxicity, which can result in temporary confusion or potentially fatal brain swelling. Juno Therapeutics, a biotech firm in Seattle, shut down one of its CAR T-cell programs after five patients died of brain swelling. Novartis has not seen brain swelling in its trials, company officials said. To try to ensure patient safety, Novartis is not planning a typical product rollout, with a drug pushed as widely and aggressively as possible. The company instead will designate 30 to 35 medical centers to administer the treatment. Many of them took part in the clinical trial, and all have gotten extensive training by Grupp and others. Grupp said he and his staff learned about the side effects of CAR T-cell therapy — and what to do about them — through terrifying experiences that began five years ago with Emily Whitehead. The young girl, who had relapsed twice on conventional treatments for acute lymphoblastic leukemia, was in grave condition. Grupp suggested to her parents that she be the first child to get the experimental therapy. ""I said, ‘Surely, this has been tried on kids somewhere else in the world,' "" recalled her father, Thomas Whitehead of Philipsburg, Pa. ""But Steve said, ‘Nope, some adults got it, but that was a different kind of leukemia.' "" After she received the therapy, Emily's fever soared, her blood pressure plummeted, and she ended up in a coma and on a ventilator for two weeks in the hospital's intensive care unit. Convinced his patient would not survive another day, a frantic Grupp got rushed lab results that suggested a surge of the protein Interleukin 6 was causing her immune system to relentlessly hammer her body. Doctors decided to give Emily an immunosuppressant drug called tocilizumab. She was dramatically better within hours. She woke up the next day, her seventh birthday. Tests showed her cancer was gone. The approval of CAR T-cell therapy would represent the second big immunotherapy advance in less than a decade. In 2011, the FDA cleared the first agent in a new class of drugs called checkpoint inhibitors. It has approved five more since then. There are big differences between the two approaches. The checkpoint inhibitors are targeted at solid tumors, such as advanced melanoma and lung and bladder cancer, while CAR T-cell therapy has been aimed at blood disorders. And although checkpoint inhibitors are off the shelf, with every patient getting the same drug, CAR T-cell therapy is customized to an individual. Many immunotherapy experts think the greatest progress against cancer will be achieved when researchers figure out how to combine the approaches. For the Penn team, the CAR T-cell story goes back decades, starting at the then-National Naval Medical Center in Bethesda, Md., where June and a postdoctorate fellow named Bruce Levine worked on new HIV treatments. In the process, they figured out a way to turbocharge T cells to make them more powerful and plentiful. The pair moved to Philadelphia in 1999 and dove into cancer research. Two years later, June's wife died of ovarian cancer, something he has credited as spurring him to work even harder in the field. In the years that followed, researchers across the country, including at the Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle, racked up an array of tantalizing discoveries involving T cells. Fast-forward to 2010, when Ludwig, who lives in Bridgeton, N.J., became Penn's first patient to receive CAR T-cell therapy. Two other men got the treatment not long after. One is still in remission; the other relapsed and died. But after those three patients, the Penn researchers ran out of money for more treatments. To try to raise interest and funding, they decided to publish the results of their work. The article that appeared in the New England Journal of Medicine in August 2011 created a ""firestorm,"" June said — one that brought them new resources. David Porter, a Penn oncologist working with June, was on vacation in western Maryland and had to stop at a Kohl's to buy a dress shirt for the immediate TV interviews. The pediatric trial opened the following spring with Emily. Six months later, Penn licensed its technology to Novartis in exchange for financial support, which included a new on-campus cell-manufacturing facility. With FDA approval seeming imminent, the researchers who were so instrumental in the therapy's development and testing are almost giddy. Grupp is especially pleased that the advance will be available first to children. ""Usually everything is developed first for adults,"" he noted recently, ""and children are an afterthought.""

"En Español By Serena Gordon HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, June 28, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Something as simple as taking a low-dose aspirin every day may protect pregnant women from the life-threatening condition known as preeclampsia, new research suggests. ""Preeclampsia is one of the most serious complications of pregnancy, with a high risk of death for the mother and baby,"" said senior study author Dr. Kypros Nicolaides. He is a professor of fetal medicine at Kings College Hospital in London. But he added, ""This condition is, to a great extent, preventable."" The new study looked at an aspirin dose of 150 milligrams (mg) per day because some past studies with smaller daily doses of aspirin have produced conflicting results, according to Nicolaides. A baby aspirin dose is 81 milligrams. In those studies using smaller doses, the reduction in preeclampsia risk hovered around 10 percent, he said, but the higher dose in this latest study was linked to a 62 percent reduction in risk. Preeclampsia is a serious high blood pressure disorder. It can affect all of the organs in a woman's body, according to the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG). The exact cause of the disorder is unknown, but certain risk factors make it more likely to occur, including: A past history of preeclampsia, Being pregnant with more than one baby, Having longstanding high blood pressure, Having chronic conditions, such as type 1 or type 2 diabetes, autoimmune disease and kidney problems. Dr. Mitchell Kramer, chairman of the department of obstetrics and gynecology at Huntington Hospital in New York, said he'd add women who are severely obese and women who've had babies who had restricted growth to the list of women at high risk of preeclampsia. ACOG already recommends that women who are at high risk of preeclampsia take a low-dose baby aspirin beginning between 12 and 28 weeks of pregnancy. About 1,600 women completed the double-blind, placebo-controlled study. Just under 800 were randomly put into the daily aspirin group, while just over 800 were placed in the placebo group. The women came from 13 different maternity hospitals across Europe and Israel. Instead of relying solely on standard risk factors, the researchers combined those risk factors with measurements of maternal blood flow, blood pressure and two hormones produced by the placenta. They used an algorithm they designed to combine all those factors to select women who they believed were at a high risk of preeclampsia. Between 11 and 14 weeks, the women began taking a daily 150 mg aspirin or a placebo. They continued taking the pills until they were 36 weeks' pregnant, or sooner if they delivered the baby early. Just 13 women in the aspirin group developed preeclampsia, while 35 women in the placebo group developed the complication, the findings showed. The reduction in risk was even greater for early deliveries. Women who delivered at less than 34 weeks were 82 percent less likely to have preeclampsia if they were taking 150 mg of aspirin, Nicolaides said. There were no serious side effects for expectant mothers, or adverse events for the babies related to aspirin use during pregnancy, the researchers noted. However, as with all drugs, women should talk to their doctor about the use of aspirin in pregnancy before taking up this regimen, because aspirin does increase the risk for bleeding. Nicolaides said the aspirin may help improve blood flow from the mother to the placenta. According to Kramer, ""This randomized study concludes that [aspirin's] use is not only effective for reducing the incidence of preeclampsia at term, but also preterm. This is important because it will reduce the need for preterm delivery, which is risky for the baby."" Low-dose aspirin can also help reduce the chances of eclampsia, which is seizures due to preeclampsia for high-risk women, Kramer noted. The study is scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Fetal Medicine Foundation meeting in Slovenia. The findings were also published simultaneously in a special online issue of the New England Journal of Medicine.

"The prospect of resolving nagging knee pain – or discomfort that's come on fairly sudden – drives many patients to go under the knife, specifically to have an arthroscopic knee procedure done. During the procedure, an orthopedic surgeon inserts a tiny camera – or arthroscope – through a small incision to view the inside of the knee. The doctor then attempts to surgically address the knee pain, such as making repairs to a torn meniscus – a C-shaped disc that cushions the knee – or realigning a misaligned patella or kneecap. ""There are some limited circumstances where it's helpful,"" says Dr. Reed Siemieniuk, an internist in Toronto and a doctorate student in health research methodology at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. That includes young patients who have sports injuries, or tears in the ligaments of the knee, he says, and patients who have bleeding in the knee – to try to figure out where the bleeding is coming from and address that. The surgery could also benefit individuals of any age who've suffered a traumatic injury to the knee, such as a meniscus tear. An example of a good candidate for arthroscopic knee surgery would be a 30-year-old who twists his knee getting up from a seated position or while playing tennis, says Dr. Joseph Bosco, a professor and vice chair of the department of orthopedic surgery at NYU Langone Medical Center. But a meta-analysis led by Siemieniuk of research on arthroscopic knee surgery strongly recommended against knee scoping ""in nearly all patients with degenerative knee disease."" The clinical practice guideline was published in the BMJ in May. The analysis evaluated arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease, which is often synonymous with knee arthritis. ""It is knee pain or locking that occurs with use or overuse. The most common risk factor is being overweight or obese,"" Siemieniuk explains. ""We use the term degenerative knee disease rather than arthritis because some surgeons restrict the diagnosis of arthritis to those diagnosed by X-ray or MRI when in reality, many people have degenerative knee disease with normal X-rays and MRIs."" Meniscus tears are also a common finding in those with arthritis, or degenerative knee disease, and are not associated with knee symptoms, but are often used as a reason to operate, he adds. ""In all of those groups of patients, arthroscopic surgery … doesn't have any long-term benefit for pain or for function or quality of life,"" Siemieniuk says. ""But it does have some downsides [including] two to six weeks recovery time, and some rare but more serious adverse effects like blood clots that can sometimes be fatal [and] infection."" The procedure is generally considered safe, but given the lack of evidence demonstrating a long-term benefit in these common scenarios, clinicians and patients should look at other non-surgical options to address knee pain, the researchers assert. The alternatives they cite include losing weight, if a person is overweight, physical therapy, corticoid steroid injections and other types of injections into the joint to treat pain or taking non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs known as NSAIDs. ""Then if it's severe and it really is interfering with your quality of life and it's persistent … some people require knee replacement surgery,"" Siemieniuk says. ""But nowhere along that line should ... arthroscopic surgery, which is even more common, be performed."" Bosco says he generally agrees with the recommendation set forth, and that it doesn't change the way he practices. But he emphasizes that each patient has to be treated individually. The recommendation suggests similarly that individual factors and patient values and preferences must be taken into account. The expert panel that created the guidelines published in the BMJ included not only doctors but also several patients who had osteoarthritis, including one who'd had arthroscopic knee surgery. ""Our strong recommendation against arthroscopy reflects a low value on a modest probability (less than 15 percent) of small or very small improvement in short-term pain and function that does not persist to one year, and a higher value on avoiding the burden, postoperative limitations and rare serious adverse effects associated with knee arthroscopy,"" the researchers wrote. The panel felt that almost all patients would share these values. ""The recommendation is not applicable to patients who do not share these values (that is, those who place a high value on a small, uncertain and transient reduction in pain and function, and a low value on avoiding the burden and postoperative limitation associated with arthroscopy),"" the researchers added. But many arthroscopic surgeries are being done that don't benefit patients, Siemieniuk stressed. In Ontario, approximately 90 percent of arthroscopic surgeries are performed for degenerative knee disease, he says. Though he adds that it's difficult to know exactly what proportion of arthroscopic knee surgeries were for degenerative knee disease in the United States, the researchers reported that arthroscopic procedures for degenerative knee disease cost more than $3 billion per year in the U.S. alone, according to previous research. Citing other studies, they report that arthroscopic knee surgery for degenerative knee disease is the most common orthopedic procedure in countries where data is available and that more than 2 million procedures are done annually worldwide. Despite the concern that many arthroscopic surgeries are being performed on patients who won't benefit, some clinicians say these type of guidelines have already been adopted by many surgeons. The new recommendation comes as no surprise, says Dr. Alejandro Gonzalez Della Valle, a hip and knee surgeon at Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City. ""For a number of years, we have known, that if we offer arthroscopic surgery to patients who have moderate or severe arthritis, they generally don't do well in the long-term,"" he says. Frequently patients with lots of arthritis in the knee also have torn meniscus. But performing arthroscopic surgery won't relieve a patient of the discomfort from the underlying arthritis. ""Fixing the torn meniscus will not cure the patient's pain,"" he says. ""Under those conditions, the surgery will not be useful or effective or will not provide any benefit to the patient."" On the other hand, some patients have very minimal arthritis in the knee, and a very severe meniscal tear producing a lot of pain. ""In our clinical impression, those patients can do well for several years with arthroscopic surgery,"" he says. ""So it's all about patient selection at the end of the day."" For ideal arthroscopic candidates – like those who suffer a traumatic or sports-related meniscal tear, who have no arthritis – arthroscopic surgery can provide a permanent fix.",0,story_reviews_00213
"En Español MONDAY, June 19, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture is a safe and effective alternative to pain medications for some emergency room patients, a new study reports. ""While acupuncture is widely used by practitioners in community settings for treating pain, it is rarely used in hospital emergency departments,"" said study lead investigator Marc Cohen. He is a professor in the School of Health and Biomedical Sciences at RMIT University in Melbourne, Australia. The study -- billed as the world's largest randomized, controlled trial of acupuncture in the emergency department -- included 528 patients. The study participants were seen at four Australian emergency departments for acute low back pain, migraines or ankle sprains. Patients who said their level of pain was at least 4 on a 10-point scale received one of three treatments: acupuncture alone; acupuncture with painkillers; or painkillers alone. One hour after treatment, less than 40 percent of all patients had significant pain reduction, meaning at least a 2-point decline on the 10-point scale. More than 80 percent still had a pain rating of at least 4, the findings showed. But two days later, most patients were satisfied. Overall, nearly 83 percent of acupuncture-only patients said they would probably or definitely repeat their treatment, compared with about 81 percent in the combined group, and 78 percent who took painkillers alone. ""Emergency nurses and doctors need a variety of pain-relieving options when treating patients, given the concerns around opioids such as morphine, which carry the risk of addiction when used long-term,"" Cohen said in a university news release. The study results suggest acupuncture would be especially beneficial for patients who can't use standard pain-relieving drugs because of other medical conditions, Cohen added. But he noted that more research is needed because some patients remained in pain no matter what treatment they received. The study was published June 18 in the Medical Journal of Australia.

"George Burke has a talent for tossing back his daily cocktail — which contains vitamins, minerals, muscle-building compounds, some little-known research drugs and a microdose of LSD — in almost a single gulp. It's a weird but handy trick for someone who swallows 25 pills a day, most of them purchases off the Internet. Burke credits the regimen with giving him the cognitive edge he needs to thrive in California's Silicon Valley, where he's the co-founder of a food service that caters to athletes and fitness devotees. He used to get his edge from Adderall, but after moving from New Jersey to San Francisco, he says, he couldn't find a doctor who would write him a prescription. Driven to the Internet, he discovered a world of cognition-enhancing drugs known as nootropics — some prescription, some over-the-counter, others available on a worldwide gray market of private sellers — said to improve memory, attention, creativity and motivation. ""It's not like every tech worker in Silicon Valley is taking nootropics to get ahead,"" Burke acknowledges. ""It's the few who are getting ahead who are using supplements to do that."" The word ""nootropic"" was coined in 1972 by a Romanian scientist, Corneliu Giurgea, who combined the Greek words for ""mind"" and ""bending."" Caffeine and nicotine can be considered mild nootropics, while prescription Ritalin, Adderall and Provigil (modafinil, a drug for treating narcolepsy) lie at the far end of the spectrum when prescribed off-label as cognitive enhancers. Even microdosing of LSD is increasingly viewed as a means to greater productivity. But when aficionados talk about nootropics, they usually refer to substances that have supposedly few side effects and low toxicity. Most often they mean piracetam, which Giurgea first synthesized in 1964 and which is approved for therapeutic use in dozens of countries for use in adults and the elderly. Not so in the United States, however, where officially it can be sold only for research purposes. Piracetam is well studied and is credited by its users with boosting their memory, sharpening their focus, heightening their immune system, even bettering their personalities. But it's only one of many formulations in the racetam drug family. Newer ones include aniracetam, phenylpiracetam and oxiracetam. All are available online, where their efficacy and safety are debated and reviewed on message boards and in podcasts. Using ‘stacks' A number of companies now market nootropic ""stacks,"" or formulas, some of which include piracetam, herbal remedies, amino acids and citicoline, a naturally occurring brain chemical that can be taken orally as a supplement, intravenously or as a shot. Because they are sold as nutritional supplements and natural products that refrain from making health claims, they avoid close government scrutiny. When Burke began ordering piracetam online five years ago, it arrived in baggies filled with white powder. ""It was as if I was buying coke off the street,"" he recalls. These days, he buys his stack from Nootroo, a San Francisco company. But self-experimenters such as Burke often don't restrict themselves to medication alone. Dedicated brain hackers, as they call themselves, are willing to exploit their own biology to try to sharpen their mind. Their methods include meditation, cold-water plunges, periodic fasting and high-fat, low-carbohydrate ketogenic diets. ""Who doesn't want to maximize their cognitive ability? Who doesn't want to maximize their muscle mass?"" asks Murali Doraiswamy, who has led several trials of cognitive enhancers at Duke University Health System and has been an adviser to pharmaceutical and supplement manufacturers as well as the Food and Drug Administration. He attributes the demand to an increasingly knowledge-based society that values mental quickness and agility above all else. But while some studies have found short-term benefits, Doraiswamy says there is no evidence that what are commonly known as smart drugs — of any type — improve thinking or productivity over the long run. ""There's a sizable demand, but the hype around efficacy far exceeds available evidence,"" notes Doraiswamy, adding that, for healthy young people such as Silicon Valley go-getters, ""it's a zero-sum game. That's because when you up one circuit in the brain, you're probably impairing another system."" Short-term benefits? Early studies attributed a lot of short-term benefits to nootropics — so much so that in 1983, Russian scientists turned to phenylpiracetam to boost the physical and mental performance of cosmonauts during space flight. A 1999 study found that piracetam had beneficial effects on the hippocampal membranes of patients with Alzheimer's disease. The hippocampus, an area of the brain that plays a key role in the formation of new memories, typically shows severe shrinkage with Alzheimer's. The idea that piracetam might reverse that effect was exciting. Although piracetam has a history of ""relatively few side effects,"" it has fallen far short of its initial promise for treating any of the illnesses associated with cognitive decline, according to Lon Schneider, a professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at the Keck School of Medicine at the University of Southern California. ""We don't use it at all and never have."" As for newer nootropic drugs, there are unknown risks. ""Piracetam has been studied for decades,"" says cognitive neuroscientist Andrew Hill, the founder of a neurofeedback company in Los Angeles called Peak Brain Institute. But ""some of [the newer] compounds are things that some random editor found in a scientific article, copied the formula down and sent it to China and had a bulk powder developed three months later that they're selling. Please don't take it, people!"" For Burke and other brain hackers, the evidence for nootropics is strong enough. Burke, who begins each morning with a Bulletproof coffee — a rich brew of caffeine with dollops of butter and coconut oil — has created a San Francisco meetup group called Peak Performance ""to teach all my friends in the tech space about life hacks so they can kick a--better every day."" Last spring, 100 people showed up at a Peak Performance event where psychedelic psychologist James Fadiman said the key to unleashing the cognition-enhancing effects of LSD — which he listed as less anxiety, better focus, improved sleep, greater creativity — was all in the dosage. He recommended a tenth of a ""party dose"" — enough to give you ""the glow"" and enhance your cognitive powers without ""the trip."" Burke says he definitely got the glow. ""The first time I took it, I was working on a business plan. I had to juggle multiple contingencies in my head, and for some reason a tree with branches jumped into my head. I was able to place each contingency on a branch, retract and go back to the trunk, and in this visual way I was able to juggle more information."" The effects of fasting Not all brain hacking involves taking a pill, though. Nootrobox, a San Francisco company that markets a nootropic mix of vitamins, minerals and amino acids, promotes fasting as a way to energize brain and body. ""We stumbled upon fasting as a way to optimize cognition and make yourself into a more efficient human being,"" says Manuel Lam, an internal medicine physician who advises Nootrobox on clinical issues. He and members of the company's executive team have implanted glucose monitors in their arms — not because they fear diabetes but because they wish to track the real-time effect of the foods they eat. ""Fasting forces your body to deplete its glucose storage and trains it to look inside for fuel,"" Lam enthuses. ""It's like being strapped to a solar panel. The sun is always shining on you."" Nootrobox employees are encouraged to fast every Tuesday, then meet for breakfast on Wednesday at a local diner. Founded by two Stanford University computer graduates, the company has initiated an international fasting group on Facebook; at last count, there were 3,500 members. Research on animals has shown that intermittent fasting — limiting caloric intake at least two days a week — can help improve neural connections in the hippocampus and protect against the accumulation of plaque, a protein prevalent in the brains of people with Alzheimer's disease. Research has also shown that intermittent fasting helped reduce anxiety in mice. Mark Mattson, chief of the Laboratory of Neurosciences at the National Institute on Aging, has overseen a lot of the animal studies on fasting and is impressed with the evidence — so much so that he has personally adopted a regimen of intermittent fasting. ""There's pretty conclusive evidence from animal studies that intermittent fasting is beneficial for brain function and resistance to aging from neurogenerative diseases,"" he says. Fasting has been deployed since the ancient Greeks to fast-track learning. As Plato is said to have stated, ""I fast for greater physical and mental efficiency."" The philosopher Pythagoras reportedly demanded that his students fast 40 days before attending his lectures. Far easier to take a pill. Looking for an edge Vinh Ngo, a San Francisco family practice doctor who specializes in hormone therapy, has become familiar with piracetam and other nootropics through a changing patient base. His office is located in the heart of the city's tech boom and he is increasingly sought out by young, male tech workers who tell him they are interested in cognitive enhancement. Ngo has experimented with piracetam himself (""The first time I tried it, I thought, ‘Wow, this is pretty strong for a supplement.' I had a little bit of reflux, heartburn, but in general it was a cognitive enhancer. . . . I found it helpful"") and the neurotransmitter DMEA (""You have an idea, it helps you finish the thought. It's for when people have difficulty finishing that last connection in the brain""). But he has also seen patients whose propensity for self-experimentation to improve cognition got out of hand. One chief executive he treated, Ngo said, developed an unhealthy predilection for albuterol, because he felt the asthma inhaler medicine kept him alert and productive long after others had quit working. Unfortunately, the drug ended up severely imbalancing his electrolytes, which can lead to dehydration, headaches, vision and cardiac problems, muscle contractions and, in extreme cases, seizures. ""There is that culture here [in Silicon Valley] that relies on being smarter than your own self,"" Ngo says. ""People want to find an edge over their competitor — that's how they got their position in the first place. I'm trying to give them a little more wiggle room — but in a safe way."" He says he screens his patients for addiction and cardiovascular problems and creates individual treatment plans based on their health histories and blood tests. There's no one-size-fits-all approach. ""I don't have a rubber stamp for everyone, and not everyone is a candidate"" for cognitive enhancement, says Ngo, who requires that his patients sign waivers acknowledging possible health risks in taking nootropics. If, for example, someone decides to go on medication — be it Adderall, albuterol or piracetam — the patient must understand that there is a risk for high blood pressure and heart problems. ""I want to empower them,"" Ngo says, but ""there's a fine line between empowering them to make their own health decisions and staying healthy.""

"It's common for people who suffer from irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) to also struggle with depression. Now, a small study published in the journal Gastroenterology suggests that taking a probiotic supplement may provide relief from both conditions. The randomized, placebo-controlled trial shows a connection between probiotics and mood improvement in people with IBS and depression or anxiety, as well as changes in brain regions related to emotional processing. Most previous research on this topic has been on healthy people without mood disorders. For the new research, scientists from McMaster University in Canada recruited 44 adults with IBS as well as mild to moderate anxiety or depression. They were followed for 10 weeks; half took a daily dose of the probiotic Bifidobacterium longum, and half took a placebo. The probiotics were manufactured and provided by Nestle, which also funded the study. (Nestle was not involved in collection, analysis or interpretation of study data.) After six weeks, twice as many people who took the probiotic had decreased depression scores compared to those who took the placebo: 64% versus 32%. Results were similar after 10 weeks, as well. When people in the study were given functional MRI scans, the researchers found that improved depression scores were associated with changes in activity of several brain areas involved in mood regulation. Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now Those changes in brain activity ""support the notion that this probiotic has anti-depressive properties,"" the authors wrote in their paper. While their data did not show significant independent changes in anxiety, constipation, diarrhea or pain, people who took the probiotic did report improvements in overall symptoms of IBS and in quality of life. One explanation for the improved mood in the group taking probiotics could be that because their physical symptoms feel better, their mood gets better too. That's why Dr. Roger McIntyre, professor of psychiatry and pharmacology at the University of Toronto, thinks the fMRI findings are the most interesting and important aspect of the new study: they signal that the probiotics may really be working on the brain itself. MORE: You Asked: Should I Take Probiotics? ""We know that one part of the brain, the amygdala, tends to be red hot in people with depression, and it seemed to cool down with this intervention,"" says McIntyre, who was not involved in the new research. ""It provides more scientific believability that something in the brain, at a very biological level, seems to be affected by this probiotic."" No serious side effects related to the probiotic were reported, suggesting that such a supplement could be a safe way to treat both stomach- and mood-related symptoms. Studies have looked at various types of probiotics for IBS patients, the authors wrote, and a recent review found that bifidobacteria seemed to work better for gastrointestinal symptoms than another common probiotic, lactobacilli. Some experts believe that gut bacteria influence the brain (and vice versa) mainly through systemic inflammation. But in this study, the researchers found no difference in inflammatory markers between the probiotic and the placebo group. McIntyre points out that the bowel communicates with the brain through other pathways as well, including the metabolic and nervous systems. MORE: Should I Eat Olives? The study's findings need to be confirmed in larger independent trials, and McIntyre says he wouldn't yet recommend taking a probiotic for symptoms associated with mental disorders like depression or anxiety. (Study co-author Premysl Bercik, associate professor of medicine at McMaster University, says the formula used in the new research isn't commercially available, anyway.) ""The evidence at this point is promising,"" says McIntyre, ""but it is not sufficient to justify recommending to patients as a viable treatment strategy."" But McIntyre says the results are encouraging. ""They seem credible to me, and they might hint that there are other mechanisms, besides just inflammation, linking the GI tract to the brain,"" he says.

"En Español By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter FRIDAY, May 12, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Blood thinners are often prescribed to prevent strokes in people with the abnormal heart rhythm known as atrial fibrillation. But a new study suggests these drugs may also help keep dementia at bay. The researchers said that the key is to start blood thinners, such as warfarin, soon after atrial fibrillation is diagnosed. That's true even for people at low risk of a stroke who wouldn't normally be given blood thinners. ""We found that people who are on warfarin -- the most common blood thinner used to prevent stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation -- experienced very low rates of dementia, including Alzheimer's disease,"" said lead researcher Dr. T. Jared Bunch. He's director of heart rhythm research at Intermountain Medical Center Heart Institute in Murray, Utah. Atrial fibrillation is a common heart abnormality that affects nearly 3 million American adults. It causes the heart to beat abnormally or quiver. This causes blood to pool, and then it can clot. Atrial fibrillation can cause dementia by damaging tiny blood vessels in the brain through repeated tiny clots or small bleeds that people aren't even aware of, Bunch explained. While many patients are initially given aspirin, Bunch said aspirin's benefit in cutting the risk for dementia is limited, and patients should be started on warfarin or another blood thinner. Although the study looked at patients taking warfarin (Coumadin), newer drugs -- including rivaroxaban (Xarelto) and apixaban (Eliquis) -- should reduce the risk of dementia even more, Bunch said. In patients with atrial fibrillation, the risk of stroke is usually measured using the so-called CHADS score, the researchers said. This score assigns points for several risk factors, such as age, high blood pressure, heart disease, diabetes and a previous stroke. A score of zero to one usually means blood thinners aren't needed because the risk for stroke is low. For patients with scores above one, blood thinners are considered necessary, as these patients are judged to be at moderate to high risk, according to the researchers. In this study, however, the investigators said they found that even a short delay in giving blood thinners to patients at low risk for stroke increases the risk for dementia. In patients considered at low-risk for stroke, delaying blood-thinning treatment increased the risk for dementia 30 percent. In high-risk patients, a delay increased the risk 136 percent, the researchers reported. The longer the delay in giving blood thinners, the more the risk for dementia, the researchers said. For the study, Bunch and his colleagues looked at information from more than 76,000 atrial fibrillation patients who had no history of dementia. The average age of the study participants was 69, and 57 percent were male. The researchers looked at when treatment began: either within 30 days of atrial fibrillation diagnosis, which was considered immediate; or after a year, which was considered delayed. ""Once you are diagnosed with atrial fibrillation, starting stroke-prevention strategies immediately is essential. We shouldn't wait longer than a month to begin treatment,"" Bunch said. ""The delay in treating can be devastating to patients when they start developing mental decline years later,"" he added. The results of the study were scheduled for presentation Friday at the meeting of the Heart Rhythm Society in Chicago. Findings presented at meetings are generally viewed as preliminary until they've been published in a peer-reviewed journal. According to Dr. Byron Lee of the University of California, San Francisco (UCSF), ""There is a growing body of literature supporting the connection between atrial fibrillation and dementia."" Lee is a professor of medicine and director of the electrophysiology laboratories and clinics at UCSF. ""Therefore,"" he said, ""we need to be extremely aggressive in treating atrial fibrillation patients with anticoagulants [blood thinners] when indicated. This study shows that treatment delays of even one month can greatly increase the incidence of cognitive [mental] decline,"" Lee said.

"Blindfolded, would you know the smell of your mom, a lover or a co-worker? Not the smells of their colognes or perfumes, not of the laundry detergents they use — the smells of them?

These molecules offer a whiff of who we are, revealing age, genetics, lifestyle, hometown — even metabolic processes that underlie our health. Ancient Greek and Chinese medical practitioners used a patient's scent to make diagnoses. Modern medical research, too, confirms that the smell of someone's skin, breath and bodily fluids can be suggestive of illness. The breath of diabetics sometimes smells of rotten apples, experts report; the skin of typhoid patients, like baking bread.

"(CNN) Finding ways to fight the flu just got a tad more ribbeting -- that is, if you ask some researchers who have turned their attention to frogs. A new study suggests that mucus from the skin of certain frogs can be harnessed to obliterate flu viruses. Some frog mucus contains antimicrobial peptides, which are immune system molecules that can neutralize bacteria, viruses, and fungi. However, the flu-killing power of such peptides has been demonstrated only under a microscope and in lab mice. More research is needed to determine just how effective a peptide can be in helping humans beat the flu. ""We have identified a potentially new treatment for H1N1 human influenza virus, which is a peptide that comes from the skin of a frog from southern India,"" said Joshy Jacob , an associate professor in the Emory University School of Medicine's microbiology and immunology department, who led the study. The peptide, named urumin, specifically targets H1 flu viruses, according to the study, published Tuesday in the journal Immunity ""This peptide works by directly killing the virus, and it is specific for all influenza viruses that have a H1 type of hemagglutinin,"" Jacob said. Hemagglutinin is a spike-shaped protein found on the surface of flu viruses. For the viruses to make you sick, the spikes of hemagglutinin attach to your cells to infect them. 'It makes the virus particle fall apart' For the study, skin secretions were collected from 15 frogs, of the species Hydrophylax bahuvistara , which are about the size of a tennis ball and brightly colored. Peptides were then gathered from their secretions. A Hydrophylax bahuvistara frog in its native environment in southern India. The researchers observed how the peptides interacted with influenza viruses under a microscope and in mice. ""In this paper we screened 32 peptides, and the surprise was that four out of 32 had activity against the virus,"" Jacob said. ""Out of the four, we found one of them (urumin) was non-toxic to human cells,"" he said. ""So, we tested it against viruses that came from the 1930s until the current ones, and it kills all of the H1s. It doesn't touch H3. It's very, very specific."" Professor Joshy Jacob, in middle, seen with his colleagues David Holthausen (on left) and Song Hee Lee (on right). The researchers aren't quite sure why urumin only targets H1 viruses, but Jacob said that H1 viruses might be anatomically similar to an amphibian pathogen that the frog mucus is intended to destroy. If there is a similarity, it may explain why H1 viruses are vulnerable to urumin's wrath. ""The frog makes this peptide for its own survival. It never gets influenza,"" Jacob said, adding that the peptide fights the flu virus by destroying an important part of the hemagglutinin. To explain how the peptide works, Jacob likened hemagglutinin to a billboard sign. ""You have the message and then you have the little stem that holds it up. The message can change but the stem is the same, and this peptide targets the stem of the hemagglutinin, that's why it's very efficient,"" he said. A side-by-side electron microscope image of a flu virus before and after being exposed to the urumin peptide. The urumin peptide could be a novel treatment since it targets the hemagglutinin, unlike current drugs on the market which target other parts of the virus, resulting in less impact, Jacob said. ""It just blows it up. It makes the virus particle fall apart,"" he said. Gregory Chinchar, a professor in the University of Mississippi Medical Center's department of microbiology and immunology, said that he was surprised that the peptide targeted the hemagglutinin on the flu virus. He was not involved in the new study. ""I don't think people thought that they work that way before,"" Chinchar said about the peptide. ""They thought that they would be more targeted to membranes, but the data looks like they target the H1 protein specifically and that data looks pretty firm."" The history of 'milking' frog skin It was first discovered that frogs had a special way of warding off bacteria and other pathogens in ancient Russia, when live Russian Brown frogs were dropped into milk to keep the milk from going sour, according to the American Chemical Society ""The milk stayed good, just like you refrigerated it,"" Jacob said about the age-old Russian practice. ""In 2012, scientists took that particular frog and wanted to know why is it, why do these frogs keep milk fresh? It turned out that when you shock a frog or when you stimulate them or stress them, they secrete these short peptides into their surroundings,"" he said. ""A majority of the peptides were antibacterial and some of them kill the things that make milk go bad."" Separate studies have also shown that various amphibian and fish antimicrobial peptides play important roles in protecting the animals against invasive pathogens, including viruses. ""Amphibians, especially certain groups of frogs, produce and store large amounts of antimicrobial peptides in specialized granular glands in the skin,"" said Louise Rollins-Smith, associate professor of pathology, microbiology, and immunology at Vanderbilt University School of Medicine. ""When the skin is injured or the frog is alarmed, they release large amounts of the peptides to protect the skin."" Rollins-Smith, who was not involved in the new study, has conducted separate research on whether certain antimicrobial peptides in frogs might hold clues to preventing HIV transmission ""The peptide described in the Immunity report is somewhat unusual because of the apparent specificity,"" Rollins-Smith said about how urumin specifically targets H1 viruses. ""If further studies show that it has a low level of cytotoxicity and it can protect in other animal models of influenza, it could be developed as a potential treatment for influenza,"" she said. Cytoxicity refers to being toxic to cells in the body. ""As an amphibian biologist concerned about the loss of amphibian species around the globe, it is important to note that they may hold important secrets useful for human medicine and they should be preserved,"" she said. Ferrets are next, then possibly humans A challenge to possibly using frog mucus as a flu-fighting treatment in humans is figuring out how to get the urumin peptide to attach to flu virus cells in the human body, Jacob said. In the new study, the peptide was delivered to mice through their noses, where flu viruses were also delivered. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

"By Amy Norton HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, April 5, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Scientists report another step in the use of stem cells to help treat people with debilitating heart failure. In an early study of 27 patients, Japanese researchers used patients' own muscle stem cells to create a ""patch"" that was placed on the heart. Over the next year, the patients generally showed small improvements in their symptoms -- including the ability to walk without becoming breathless and fatigued. However, experts cautioned that while the results are encouraging, there's a lot of work left ahead before stem cells can be used to treat heart failure. ""They've shown that this approach is feasible,"" said Dr. Eiran Gorodeski, a heart failure specialist at the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. But it's not clear whether the stem-cell tactic was actually effective, said Gorodeski, who was not involved in the study. That's because the study didn't include a comparison group that did not receive stem cells. So it's possible, Gorodeski explained, that the ""modest"" symptom improvements would have happened anyway. All of the patients were on standard medications, and some had heart devices implanted. Stem cells are primitive cells that mature into the various cells that make up the body's tissues. In the past 15 years or so, scientists have tried to use the cells to help repair some of the damage seen in heart failure. Heart failure is a progressive disease where the heart muscle is too damaged to efficiently pump blood throughout the body. It often arises after a heart attack. Symptoms of heart failure include fatigue, breathlessness and swelling in the limbs. The condition cannot be cured, although medications and implantable devices can treat the symptoms. In the new study, the researchers used stem cells from the patients' own thigh muscle to create a patch they placed on the heart. That's in contrast to many past studies, where researchers have injected stem cells -- often from patients' bone marrow -- into the heart. The patch tactic could have some advantages, said senior researcher Dr. Yoshiki Sawa, of Osaka University. He said animal research suggests that cells in sheet form survive for a longer period, compared to injections. To test the safety of the approach, Sawa's team recruited 27 patients who had debilitating symptoms despite standard heart failure therapies. The scientists extracted stem cells from each patient's thigh muscle, then cultured the cells so that they formed a sheet. The sheet was placed on each patient's heart. The tactic appeared safe, the researchers said, and there were signs of symptom improvements over the next six months to a year. Why would stem cells from the thigh muscle affect the heart? It's not clear, Sawa acknowledged. The stem cells don't grow into new heart muscle cells. Instead, Sawa explained, they seem to produce chemicals called cytokines that can promote new blood vessel growth in damaged areas of the heart. The theory, he said, is that ""hibernating"" cells in the heart muscle can then function better. Still, it's too soon to know what the new findings mean, said Gorodeski. This type of trial, called phase 1, is designed to look at the safety and feasibility of a therapy, Gorodeski said. It takes later-phase trials -- where some patients receive the treatment, and others do not -- to prove that a therapy actually works. Those trials are underway, Sawa said. Other studies are further along. Last year, researchers reported on a trial testing infusions of stem cells taken from the bone marrow of patients with severe heart failure. Patients who received the therapy were less likely to die or be hospitalized over the next year, versus those given standard treatment only. But the study was small, and the stem cells had only a minor impact on patients' heart function. So it's not clear why the stem-cell patients fared better, Gorodeski said. For now, he stressed, all stem-cell therapies for heart failure remain experimental. ""There's no cell therapy that we can offer patients right now,"" Gorodeski said. The message for patients, he added, is that heart failure can be treated, and researchers are looking for ""innovative"" ways to improve that treatment. The study was published April 5 in the Journal of the American Heart Association. More information The American Heart Association has more on heart failure.",0,story_reviews_00255
"(CNN) An aspirin a day may keep the doctor away. It may also reduce your chances of dying from cancer, according to a study on long-term regular aspirin use and different kinds of cancer. Yin Cao, an instructor in the Medicine, Clinical and Translational Epidemiology Unit at Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard Medical School, presented the information Monday at the American Association for Cancer Research meeting in Washington. Cao looked at data from over 86,000 women who were part of the Nurses' Health Study between 1980 and 2012 and over 43,000 men who were part of the Health Professionals Follow-Up Study from 1986 to 2012. Over that 32-year period, over 8,200 women and nearly 4,600 men died of cancer. The risk of death overall was 7% lower for women and 11% for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who did not. The risk of dying from cancer was 7% lower for women and 15% lower for men who took aspirin regularly, compared with those who didn't take a regular dose. The strongest connection was with colorectal cancer: There was a 31% lower risk for women and 30% for men who were among regular aspirin takers, as other studies have showed. But it also lowered women's risk of dying from breast cancer by 11% and men's risk of dying from prostate cancer by 23%. Men's risk of dying from lung cancer was also lower. ""Evidence has been accumulating very rapidly showing aspirin works in reducing cancer and cardiovascular disease mortality,"" Cao said. ""It is good to remember, though, if a person wants to take a low-dose aspirin, especially if a person has had cancer, they will want to have an initial conversation with their doctor first."" Not everyone can take aspirin, particularly if you are at high risk for ulcers and gastrointestinal bleeding. Studies have showed an increased risk of both when taking a daily aspirin, but the benefit does outweigh the risk for most other people. Rulla Tamimi , the epidemiology chair for the American Association for Cancer Research annual meeting, thought the presentation was a beneficial one, particularly since scientists are trying to better understand drugs we may all have in our medicine cabinets. ""There has been a great deal of interest in understanding the possible benefits associated with common drugs,"" Tamimi said in an emailed statement. ""This study found strong evidence that aspirin use may reduce cancer death. The study was well conducted and was able to control for a number of important confounders. Therefore the findings are believed to be very robust, and suggest that aspirin, which is widely available, cheap and has limited toxicity, has the potential to have widespread benefit on cancer mortality for breast, colon, lung and prostate cancer."" Studies have also found that aspirin can help patients who have had (or are at high risk for) a heart attack or stroke, and of course it is a good drug to relieve pain. Even the ancient Egyptians used the natural form of it for pain relief centuries ago. In April 2016, the US Preventive Service Task Force said in a final recommendation statement that taking a regular low-dose aspirin a day may prevent colon cancer and cardiovascular disease for adults between 50 and 69 who have a 10% or greater risk of cardiovascular disease or colorectal cancer. Join the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.

"A Medicine That Blunts The Buzz Of Alcohol Can Help Drinkers Cut Back Enlarge this image Maria Fabrizio for NPR Maria Fabrizio for NPR If you drink more alcohol than you want to or should, you're not alone. A nationwide survey by the National Institutes of Health found that 28 percent of adults in the U.S. are heavy drinkers or drink more than is recommended. Yet, most heavy drinkers don't get the help they need. ""The biggest problem we have in the field is that less than 10 percent of individuals with an alcohol use disorder get any treatment whatsoever,"" says George Koob, director of the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism. Part of the challenge, researchers say, is that many drinkers don't realize that a medicine long used to help people addicted to opioids quit their drug habit can help alcoholics and other heavy drinkers cut back, too. ""I thought my only option was AA,"" John tells NPR. We've agreed to use only his middle name; disclosing his trouble with alcohol publicly, he says, would jeopardize his business. He's a 47-year-old professional who says he started out as a social drinker — a few beers with his softball team after a game. But he sank into a deep depression after several deaths in his family, and sought ""solace in the bottle,"" he says. ""I wanted to numb my thoughts,"" says John. He'd often start with hard liquor in the morning, John says, and it wasn't uncommon to have eight drinks or more before the end of the day. He worked from home, so he was able to mask the problem for a while. But eventually his wife confronted him. ""She had come home and I was rushing to hide a glass and she was furious with me,"" he recalls. ""Just absolutely furious."" He went to see Paula DeSanto, a therapist and director of Minnesota Alternatives, in Spring Lake Park, Minn. The center provides outpatient mental health and substance use treatment services. ""I would say John's story is not unique,"" DeSanto tells us. ""A lot of people are reluctant."" Sometimes, traditional treatments — such as residential rehab or a 12-step program like Alcoholics Anonymous — ""can [lead to] a significant disruption in their lives,"" she explains. ""There's stigma, shame and embarrassment."" DeSanto suggested a different approach to John. To help work through the loss and grief he was feeling, counseling can help, she told him. She also recommended he try naltrexone, a prescription drug. ""Naltrexone is an effective medication for the treatment of alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. He points to a recent meta-analysis published in the journal Addiction that concluded that naltrexone helped reduce heavy drinking and cravings for alcohol. The analysis included data from 64 clinical trials in which people were given either the medication or a placebo pill to test the effectiveness of the treatment. The analysis also found that another drug, acamprosate, is effective at helping people who have already stopped drinking to maintain abstinence, perhaps partly by easing the physical and emotional cravings experienced by heavy drinkers who quit. So, how does naltrexone work? The drug seems to curb the euphoric and sedative effects of opiates in the brain. Alcohol is known to activate some of the same receptors in the brain that opioids do, and studies find that by tempering the pleasure from alcohol, naltrexone can help people drink less. ""It blunts the effects of alcohol,"" says Koob. ""People [who use naltrexone] will say they have a drink, and it's not doing much for them."" That was exactly John's experience. After taking the naltrexone pill, he didn't get the buzz he was used to getting, so didn't want to keep drinking. ""I actually didn't feel the alcohol's effects,"" he says. ""It was startling."" It's now been about five months since he started taking the medication. He has not stopped drinking completely, but says he has cut way back. ""This is helping me,"" John says. ""I can go out with friends and not worry that I'm going to end up inebriated or sloppy."" According to the findings of a recent review, both naltrexone and acamprosate, are safe, cost-effective and efficacious. But they are substantially underused, according to the review. Many physicians are ""unaware that there are medications to treat alcohol use disorders,"" says Koob. His institute is stepping up efforts to work with the medical community on that front, he says, and is also touting Rethinking Drinking, a website aimed at consumers that offers the latest research-based information on a range of treatment options. Any health care provider who is licensed to prescribe medicine can prescribe naltrexone — not just mental health professionals or addiction specialists. As as long ago as 1997, a published study showed that treatment of alcohol dependence with naltrexone by primary care doctors can be effective; follow-up research has confirmed that the primary care approach not only works, but makes treatment much more accessible. According to the NIAAA, ""patients can now receive effective alcohol treatment from their primary care doctors or mental health practitioners by combining the newer medications with a series of brief office visits for support."" Naltrexone is certainly not a cure-all, researchers say. And it won't help everyone who has a drinking problem — especially if the disorder is severe. ""I use these medications as an adjunct to therapy, and group [sessions] and 12-step meetings"" says Dr. Jeffrey Hsu, a psychiatrist at Johns Hopkins University who is certified in addiction medicine. He says that when used alone the medicines are only modestly effective. But there's good evidence that the combination of counseling and drugs such as naltrexone can help people cut back on drinking, or move toward abstinence.",0,story_reviews_00277

There's a Jet Lag Eraser, for use after hopping off a long international flight, a Detoxification saline smoothie for ""improving alertness and mental acuity,"" and a Late Night Rescue cocktail to undo the effects of too many actual cocktails the night before. The company claims liquid vitamins, minerals, and amino acids delivered straight to the bloodstream can protect users from getting a cold, boost athletic performance, ""annihilate toxins,"" and stave off headaches. ""We put together the ideal combination for them to obtain the results they want: clearer skin, clearer mind, better hair, better nails,"" said Dr. Erika Schwartz, who runs the clinic. advertisement And though the IV lends a medical air to the procedure, the infusions suffer from the same problem as many supplements taken orally — there isn't any robust evidence to back up their health claims. ""Supplements don't fix anything and they don't prevent anything. It's simple,"" said Dr. Pete Miller, a clinician and nutrition researcher at Johns Hopkins. The Evolved Science clinic in New York. Evolved Science Vitamin IV infusions aren't anything new. Celebrities from Simon Cowell and Rihanna to the Real Housewives have proclaimed their love for vitamin drips. They're part of a huge — and wildly popular — supplement industry which goes largely unregulated. Supplement makers aren't allowed to claim that their products can cure or treat a particular condition, but they are allowed to make sweeping claims that the products promote health. The infusion treatments can be traced back to an intravenous supplement known as the Myers' cocktail, a slurry of magnesium, calcium, B vitamins, and other products developed decades ago by a Baltimore physician. There is a published review on the use of Myers' cocktail — but it's just a collection of anecdotal evidence. The author, Dr. Alan Gaby, has long promoted the use of intravenous vitamins for a wide range of clinical conditions. The research on injectable vitamins of any kind is thin and the results unimpressive. One study looked at injectable vitamins to treat asthma, but there was no placebo group to compare outcomes against. Two studies have examined intravenous vitamin use in fibromyalgia patients. One didn't turn up any significant improvement in patients who received the infusions. The other — which was also missing a placebo group — involved just seven patients and showed only short-term improvement in symptoms. Schwartz, though, said the supplements are completely safe. ""We're doing it in a sterile environment, it's administered by a nurse, and everything is sterile,"" she said. ""The only difference is it's kind of a beautiful environment."" Customers at Evolved Science shell out anywhere from $325 to $875 for an infusion. For first-time clients, Schwartz recommends weekly injections for the first month or so, and then a routine infusion once a month. Patients kick back in cream-colored chairs together while they're hooked up to IVs in the ""infusion lounge."" ""It doesn't look like a doctor's office. It's very relaxed, not like a spa. But like a private club. It's a SoHo house kind of thing,"" said Schwartz, a former trauma surgeon. But as for whether they'll help a client prepare for an important presentation? ""There is not not substantial evidence that vitamin supplements have a large impact on cognitive function,"" said Dr. Francine Grodstein, a public health researcher at Harvard who has studied the subject. A longitudinal study would be needed to back those claims with evidence, she added. Still, the trend seems to be going strong. The I.V. Doc — an in-home vitamin infusion service — offers on-demand nutrient drips in places including Boston, Los Angeles, Chicago, and the Hamptons. In Las Vegas, hangover buses deliver pick-me-up infusions on the go. And despite a lack of sound evidence, experts expect consumers to keep coming back for infusions. ""What drives the market is not the science,"" said Miller. ""In spite of that lack of evidence, there's still a market for it.""",0,story_reviews_00279
"Cassandra Quave, an Emory University scientist who studies how indigenous people use plants in healing practices, said researchers pulled apart the chemical ingredients of the berries and tested them in mice infected with these superbug strains. The mice got injections containing the bacteria with or without the plant extracts. Those that didn't receive the extracts developed skin lesions. But in the other mice, the extracts -- a mixture of 27 chemicals -- prevented skin lesions from forming. AD AD Instead of destroying the bacteria, the ingredients in the fruit weakened the bacteria by preventing them from producing the toxins it uses as weapons to damage tissue. The extracts from the fruit repress a gene that allows the bacterial cells to communicate with one another. ""It weakens the bacteria so the mouse's own defenses work better"" to clear the infection, she said. The plant extracts didn't harm the skin tissues or the normal, healthy bacteria found on skin. The discovery may hold the potential for new ways to treat and prevent antimicrobial-resistant infections, an enormous global problem that was the focus of a rare high-level United Nations summit last fall. AD MRSA has become a serious threat to human health; in 2011, it was responsible for more than 80,000 invasive infections and more than 11,000 deaths in the United States, according to federal statistics. AD Antimicrobial resistance refers to infections that have evolved the ability to withstand drugs that ought to stop them. The medicines include antibiotics, which act on bacteria, as well as drugs to fight fungal, viral or parasitic infections. Fighting bacteria with drugs designed to kill them helps fuel the problem of antibiotic resistance if stronger bacteria can survive and evolve to become ""superbugs."" ""But instead of always setting a bomb off to kill an infection, there are situations where using an anti-virulence method may be just as effective, while also helping to restore balance to the health of the patient,"" said Quave. Plants have been used repeatedly in traditional medicine over the centuries, and knowledge about their use is passed down from generation to generation, which points to their efficacy, she said. AD AD ""People don't save that knowledge over centuries"" if something doesn't work, she said. ""We're trying to answer the question: Does this work against bacteria, and how does it work, and is it safe to use?"" The Brazilian peppertree, a shrubby tree native to South America, is an invasive species throughout the southern United States, particularly in Florida, where it's sometimes called the Florida holly or broad-leaf peppertree, and is considered a noxious weed. The woody plant has long been a staple in Brazilian traditional medicine. Its leaves and bark are used to treat wounds, ulcers, burns and skin infections, Quave said. Less is known about the plant's fruit, which was used traditionally as topical poultices for infected wounds and ulcers. AD From an ecological standpoint, Quave said, it makes sense that invasive weeds have a chemical advantage that may help protect them from diseases so they can spread more easily in a new environment. AD But she said the average person shouldn't try to use the weed to make their own medicine. ""Not everything that is natural is safe,"" she said. Her lab at Emory is doing additional research to confirm the safest and most effective way of using the plant extract. Researchers would still need to conduct pre-clinical trials to test its medicinal benefits. Read more: AD",0,story_reviews_00285
"An app called Natural Cycles has become the first to be classified as a medical device for use as contraception. Natural Cycles uses a woman's body temperature and menstrual cycle data to tell her when she is fertile. On fertile days, users must abstain from sex or use other protection such as condoms to prevent pregnancy. The app was approved as a class IIb medical device by Tüv Süd, a notified body in Sweden where it is based. But sexual health organisations are warning that being classed as a medical device does not guarantee that the app will effectively prevent pregnancy. Sexual health charity the FPA, Fertility UK, and the Faculty of Sexual and Reproductive Health of the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists are jointly calling for more large-scale independent trials to ensure that evidence for such apps is on a par with other rigorously tested methods of contraception. Natural Cycles is one of numerous apps that help women practise a method of contraception called natural family planning, also known as the fertility awareness method. Natural family planning involves monitoring your body for signs of ovulation, like an increase in your temperature, or a change in cervical mucus. ""The thing about the female egg is that it only lives for about 24 hours. So if you could reliably know when you've ovulated as a woman, and then you give that egg two or three days to die, any time after that in the cycle you will not get pregnant because there's no egg to fertilise,"" Dr Susan Walker, a senior lecturer in sexual health at Anglia Ruskin University, told BuzzFeed News. Taking your temperature is what sets Natural Cycles and other apps like it apart from standard period-tracking apps. Without temperature information an app can can guess at your ovulation day based on your average cycle length, but can't be sure when you actually have ovulated, and so you can't use it as a reliable form of birth control. You don't actually need an app to practise natural family planning – although it does cut down on paperwork. Even so, the FPA advises that natural family planning is most effective if you're taught how to do it by a specialist teacher, and you monitor all three fertility indicators – temperature, menstrual cycle length, and cervical secretions. But natural family planning is not for everyone. For starters, it can only protect against pregnancy, not STIs. And if you're considering ditching the Pill because remembering to take it each day is too much effort, you probably won't like having to remember to take your temperature every morning. ""You really have to commit to it, whether you're doing it the traditional way or you're using an app. You have to take your temperature every morning and record that, because without all that data it's not really any use to you,"" Bekki Burbidge, head of communications at the FPA, told BuzzFeed News. ""It's not a method that's going to suit everybody."" But for women like Natural Cycles co-founder Dr Elina Berglund, who want an alternative to hormonal contraception, it's an option worth pursuing. Along with her husband and co-founder Dr Raoul Scherwitzl, Berglund created the algorithm used in the app for personal use, before deciding it was something she should share with the rest of the world. ""When it comes to contraception it's all about choice. It's not like one solution will fit all women,"" said Berglund. ""Our typical user is in a stable relationship a few years before wanting to have kids. At first she starts to use the app to prevent pregnancy, and when she's ready [to get pregnant] she switches to plan, and usually she gets pregnant quite quickly, because the app already knows her body and cycle."" To use the app, you need a monthly or yearly subscription, and a thermometer that you have to use to take your temperature each morning before you get out of bed. The app then tells you if you're likely to be fertile or not that day. And if the app gives you a ""red day"" – meaning you could be fertile – you have to abstain from sex, or use another method of protection such as condoms.",0,story_reviews_00288
"A small study claims children with autism may benefit from fecal transplants, which involves introducing donated microbes into people with gastrointestinal disease to rebalance the gut. The Ohio State University, Northern Arizona University and Arizona State University researchers found a parallel between behavioral symptoms of autism and gastrointestinal distress, and improvements to both after fecal transplant. ""Transplants are working for people with other gastrointestinal problems,"" lead study author Ann Gregory, a microbiology graduate student at The Ohio state University, said in a news release. ""And, with autism, gastrointestinal symptoms are often severe, so we thought this could be potentially valuable. The researchers built off of previous findings that children with autism typically have fewer types of important bacteria in their guts and less bacterial diversity overall. The research team surmises the disparity is due to antibiotics prescribed within the first three years of life. The study, which was published in the journal Microbiome, included 18 children with autism and moderate to severe gastrointestinal problems. The children ranged from 7 to 16 years old. A questionnaire was used to assess social skills, irritability, hyperactivity and communication. Parents and doctors reported improvements that lasted at least eight weeks after treatment. Children without autism were used as a control for the study, the news release reported. On average, the score on a scale for ranking gastrointestinal symptoms dropped 82 percent from the beginning to the end of treatment, while average developmental age increased by 1.4 years, according to the release. Researchers also asked the children's doctors to perform pre- and post-diagnostic evaluations, which suggested lasting benefits. One of the study's limitations is its small size, and researchers cautioned that families should not try to replicate the treatment at home. ""We have to be mindful of the placebo effect, and we have to take [the findings] with a grain of salt,"" Matthew Sullivan, an associate professor of microbiology at The Ohio State University, said in the release. ""But it does give us hope.""",0,story_reviews_00295
"By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Jan. 25, 2017 (HealthDay News) -- Just how successful is the procedure called catheter ablation at fixing irregular heartbeats that can be potentially fatal? Pretty successful, a new study found, but there are caveats. Burning or freezing specific areas of the heart can alleviate the common irregular heart beat called atrial fibrillation in 74 percent of patients. However, the procedure doesn't work for everyone and there are risks of complications, researchers report. Atrial fibrillation increases the risk of early death by two times in women and 1.5 times in men. It causes 20 to 30 percent of all strokes and can decrease quality of life due to palpitations, shortness of breath, tiredness, weakness and psychological distress, the study authors explained. About 2.7 million Americans suffer from atrial fibrillation, according to the American Heart Association. For those whose atrial fibrillation can't be controlled with medications, catheter ablation may be recommended. ""Catheter ablation is a valid alternative for the management of atrial fibrillation with a satisfactory success rate,"" said study lead researcher Dr. Elena Arbelo. But the procedure can have complications, which should be considered carefully by doctors and patients, said Arbelo, a senior specialist in the Cardiovascular Institute at the Hospital Clinic of Barcelona in Spain. Complications can include fluid buildup around the heart, called cardiac tamponade, which makes it difficult for the heart to pump blood. Other complications include stroke or mini-stroke, Arbelo said. In addition, many patients need to continue blood thinners and medications that control irregular heartbeats after the procedure, she explained. During the procedure, a wire is threaded through the blood vessels into the heart and used to burn or freeze small areas of the upper chamber, called the atrium. The burning or freezing creates a scar and stops abnormal electrical signals that cause the irregular heart rhythm, Arbelo said. According to Dr. Hugh Calkins, ""Atrial fibrillation ablation is a well-established procedure that has imperfect results."" Calkins is a professor of medicine and director of the cardiac arrhythmia service at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore. The complication rate is higher than hoped, and the success rate is lower than hoped, he said. ""Patients don't get a lifetime certificate saying you're cured,"" Calkins said. ""For one in four patients, atrial fibrillation comes back five years after the procedure. Patients should not be going into this thinking they will have a 99 percent cure rate with no risk,"" he added. The new study included information from more than 3,600 patients in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa. Their average age was 59, and all had undergone catheter ablation. Ablation was successful in 74 percent of patients, Arbelo said. These patients had no atrial arrhythmias -- irregular heart beats -- for three to 12 months after the procedure. According to Arbelo, 91 percent of patients choose to have ablation to relieve symptoms, while 66 percent do so to improve their quality of life. Atrial arrhythmias in the first three months after ablation were classified as early recurrences and not considered as failures, Arbelo said. In addition, 45 percent of patients who had a successful procedure were still taking antiarrhythmia drugs 12 months later. About 11 percent suffered complications during the year after the ablation, she said. After the procedure, patients with two or more risk factors for stroke should be prescribed oral blood thinners, while those with no risk factors don't need them, Arbelo suggested. The study investigators found that 27 percent of patients with two or more risk factors for stroke were not on blood thinners, but one-third of low-risk patients were taking them. Dr. Gregg Fonarow is a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles. He said, ""Relief of symptoms in patients with atrial fibrillation can be challenging."" In certain patients, catheter ablation may reduce symptoms, improve quality of life and increase exercise capacity, though the impact on death and hospitalization risk is still being evaluated, he noted. ""Of concern is that complication rates are still higher than desirable for this procedure, and there was suboptimal use of stroke-preventing anticoagulation [anti-clotting] therapy after the procedure,"" added Fonarow, who was not involved with the study. ""Further trials are needed to evaluate the benefits and risks of catheter ablation and its potential role as first-line therapy,"" he suggested. Catheter ablation is covered by most insurance, including Medicare, the researchers said. The report was published online recently in the European Heart Journal.

"Risk of early death is as low for those who meet recommended activity targets in one or two sessions a week as it is for daily exercisers, study shows People who cram all their exercise into one or two sessions at the weekend benefit nearly as much as those who work out more frequently, researchers say. A study of more than 60,000 adults in England and Scotland found that ""weekend warriors"" lowered their risk of death by a similar margin to those who spread the same amount of exercise over the whole week. The findings will reassure people who find it hard to make time for a daily exercise routine and opt instead to break a sweat once or twice a week in the hope of keeping fit. Health racket: tennis reduces risk of death at any age, study suggests Read more ""Millions of people enjoy doing sport once or twice a week, but they may be concerned that they are not doing enough,"" said Gary O'Donovan, a physical activity researcher and author on the study at Loughborough University. ""We find a clear benefit. It's making them fit and healthy."" The UK's National Health Service recommends that to ward off an early death, people should spend 150 minutes a week performing moderate exercise, or 75 minutes a week doing vigorous exercise. As a rule of thumb, moderate exercise can be done while maintaining a conversation, whereas during vigorous exercise talking at the same time is too hard. In the study, those who met the physical activity target by exercising through the week had a 35% lower risk of death than the inactive adults, with cardiovascular deaths down 41% and a 21% lower risk of cancer death. But the weekend warriors also saw substantial health benefits if they met the physical activity target too. Their overall risk of death was 30% lower than the sedentary adults, with the risk of cardiovascular and cancer deaths lower by 40% and 18% respectively. The joy of steps: why humans are built to get a high from being on the move Read more ""Weekend warriors are people who meet the recommended volume of physical activity each week through only one or two sessions. There are doing a large proportion of vigorous exercise and that makes you fitter than moderate exercise,"" said O'Donovan. Men and women benefited equally, according to the study published in the Journal of the American Medical Association: Internal Medicine. The results are based on medical data gathered for 63,591 adults aged 40 and above between 1994 and 2012. Nearly 9,000 of the study participants died in the period. For those who have resolved to get fit in the New Year, O'Donovan recommends to start with moderate exercise, such as brisk walking, and then to set realistic, incremental goals to boost confidence without running the risk of setbacks due to injury. ""A middle aged or older person should do as much as 12 weeks of moderate exercise before introducing vigorous exercise,"" he said. Ulf Ekelund at the Norwegian School of Sport Sciences in Oslo said the study emphasised what researchers have found time and again: that even a small amount of regular exercise wards off death. In the study, those who exercised a little had a 29% lower risk of death than those who did no exercise at all. ""The novel finding is that it appears the duration, and possibly the intensity, of leisure time physical activity is more important than the frequency,"" Ekelund said. ""My take home message is that the greatest risk reduction and the greatest gain for the individual and for public health is if those who are physically inactive take up some activity,"" he added.",0,story_reviews_00302
"It's the person who wakes up at the crack of dawn on the weekend, puts on shiny spandex and disappears with a mountain bike for hours at a time.

It's the weekly rock climbers and double spin class-takers schvitzing their Sunday away.

Related: Americans keep getting fatter, new report shows A paper published January 9 in JAMA Internal Medicine suggests these warriors may be onto something. In a study based on nearly 64,000 adults, researchers in the U.K. found that weekend exercise appears to be just as effective at preventing heart disease and cancer as exercise done more frequently. This is great news for anyone who feels too busy on weekdays to work out but enjoys outdoor activity on the weekend. Try Newsweek for only $1.25 per week ""I think that the weekend warrior physical activity pattern is beneficial because they are actually doing a large proportion of vigorous intensity activity. And vigorous activity makes you fit, and fitness reduces your risk of disease and death,"" says Gary O'Donovan, a researcher in physical activity and sedentary behavior at England's Loughborough University and lead author of the paper. O'Donovan and fellow researchers looked at data on middle-aged adults who responded to a government-sponsored household survey conducted from 1994 to 2012. The survey included questions about health history and fitness habits. The researchers then cross-referenced this information with health department death records. They found the risk of death from all causes was about 30 percent lower for weekend warriors, compared with adults who maintained a sedentary lifestyle. And the warriors had a 40 percent lower risk of cardiovascular death and an 18 percent lower risk for cancer-related death. The mortality rates of weekend warriors were roughly the same as those who claimed to exercise more than two days a week but for shorter durations. However, there are also some limitations to this study, the researchers say. More than 90 percent of the subjects were white. The information about physical activity was reported by the participants, and it's likely that many were too generous in their estimates of how much time they spent at the gym. Unfortunately, taking 20 minutes in locker room to put on your sneakers doesn't count as a workout. Related: Severe childhood obesity is on the rise in the U.S. It's recommended that people get 150 minutes (or two and half hours) of exercise each week, based on guidelines from the American Heart Association, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and other medical authorities. This could be something as simple as a brisk walk or other low-impact options for vigorous exercise about 20 minutes a day. (Experts often encourage recreational athletes to not exercise more than an hour a day.) ""In theory, someone who did one bout of 150 minutes of moderate exercise is a weekend warrior,"" says O'Donovan. This study shows that it doesn't matter how you decide to split up the recommended weekly amount of exercise. You just need to do it. However, experts caution that it is possible to overdo it, and more exercise than two and a half hours a week can actually be unhelpful and even harmful. One study, published in 2014 in the journal Heart, suggests that in people with existing heart disease, the risk for cardiac arrest and stroke was the same for people who exercised more than an hour a day compared with those who didn't exercise at all. The coronary heart disease patients who stuck with the recommended 150 minutes a week had the lowest risk for heart attack and stroke.

He says someone who is not in good shape is at risk for sudden cardiac arrest or acute injury, such as spraining muscles or putting too much stress on joints. O'Donovan encourages aspiring weekend warriors to start slowly to avoid any health problems. He says middle-aged adults should exercise moderately during the first 12 weeks and then slowly build up to more vigorous activity.",0,story_reviews_00303
"On a scale of 1 to 10, lower back pain can register somewhere between ""I need an aspirin"" to ""please jack me up with morphine."" Those suffering from such discomfort might feel moderate to mild pain that is not debilitating. In severe cases, they could feel like a giant electrified claw has claimed the lower part of their back, tearing into each nerve in that part of the body. The smallest of movements – getting up from a chair, walking or even coughing – can feel torturous. Maybe the lower back is as stiff as hardened concrete and as sensitive as an exposed nerve. A simple lumbar support device, or back brace, can provide short-term relief, research shows, according to an analysis of 28 studies published in the September 2016 issue of the Annals of Physical Rehabilitation Medicine journal. While these devices won't cure the underlying condition, they're simple and relatively inexpensive. In the 2016 meta-analysis, researchers concluded that lumbar support devices are useful for improving function and reducing pain among those suffering from subacute back pain, which means it's past the acute stage – which is sudden and short in duration – but not long-lasting enough to be chronic. ""Lumbar support devices provide enough compression and support for the lower back to allow healing to occur,"" says Christopher Cousins, a physical therapist based in the District of Columbia. ""The compression on the abdomen means there's less pressure on your lower back discs, ligaments, muscles and spine."" Lumbar devices typically fit around your waist and are secured with Velcro. They often have a steel or plastic plate attached to the section that would press against the patient's lower back to provide support; some have over-the-shoulders straps. Most over-the-counter lumbar support devices cost between $25 and $130, and they're available at many drug stores, Target and Wal-Mart, plus online without a a prescription. Custom-made lumbar support devices, which are contoured to the natural curvature of the patient's spine, cost from a few hundred dollars to about $1,000, Cousins says. People who suffer mild to moderate subacute back pain should put on a back brace as soon as their discomfort sets in, says Scott Bautch, a chiropractor in Wasau, Wisconsin, and president of the American Chiropractic Association's council on occupational health. ""You want to give yourself bracing so you can move,"" Bautch says. ""Inactivity or immobilization is the worst thing for a back. You want to remain active, and a brace can help you do that."" Some studies have shown that wearing a lumbar support device could lead to negative effects, such as skin lesions, muscle wasting, gastrointestinal disorders, higher blood pressure and higher heart rates. Those issues are rare and typically occur with people who wear a back brace for an extended period of time, for more than the week or two most experts recommend, Bautch says. If a back brace fits well, is worn properly – that is, it's not too snug – and is not overused, it shouldn't create any health problems, Bautch says. During the course of his 30-year career, Bautch says, hundreds of his patients have worn lumbar support devices. None of them developed any problems, aside from a handful who had minor skin irritation where part of the brace rubbed their body, Bautch says. He remedied that issue by having his patients wear an undershirt between the lumbar support device and their skin. Searing, subacute back pain is caused by an array of conditions, including a herniated disc, in which the soft, jelly-like center inside the disc pushes out through a tear in its tough exterior and irritates nerves. A herniated disc can cause sciatica, a painful condition that affects the back, hips and legs and is caused by the compression of a spinal nerve root in the lower back. Spinal discs degenerate with age, and a herniated disc can occur without a physical injury, says Dr. Neel Anand, director of spine trauma at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. ""Think of your disc like your car tire – it's going to wear out,"" Anand says. Before getting a lumbar support device for your lower back pain, experts recommend these steps: 1. If you have severe pain, see a physician quickly. If your back pain or stiffness is so bad you can't move without tremendous discomfort, see a doctor as soon as possible, Bautch says. If your pain and stiffness are that severe, a back brace may not be of much immediate use, he says, adding that it may be helpful once the pain and stiffness subside to a tolerable level where you can move. Moderate to mild lower back pain often subsides after five days or so, but if your discomfort persists beyond that or worsens, see a doctor, adds Dr. Megan Cortazzo, medical director of clinical documentation improvement and health information management at the University of Pittsburgh Medical Center. A doctor can test for and rule out serious potential causes, such as kidney stones, an abdominal aneurysm and cancer, Cortazzo says. Doctors can order an array of tests, such as an X-ray, MRI or CT scan, to arrive at the correct diagnosis, which will help lead to the most effective treatment plan, she says. The goal of most treatment regimens is strengthening the patient's core muscles supporting the spine so the pain doesn't recur. Treatment could include physical therapy, a stretching routine, yoga or Pilates. Many people also find chiropractic adjustments helpful, says Robert Hayden, a chiropractor based in Griffin, Georgia. 2. Find a lumbar support device that fits you. Once you've been diagnosed, look for a lumbar support device that fits the natural curvature of your spine, says Dr. Jeremy Smith, an orthopedic spine surgeon at the Hoag Orthopedic Institute in Irvine, California. Try on a few at the store before buying one, he advises. If you buy the device online, you can return it if it doesn't fit. ""It needs to naturally contour and fit, kind of like a glove, so all surface areas are in contact with your back. It should help remind you to keep good posture,"" Smith says. ""The device should be snug, but not too tight. It shouldn't constrict your breathing."" 3. Don't become reliant on your back brace. Patients should wear a back brace for no longer than a few days to two weeks at the most, Bautch says. ""Longer than that, and your muscles start to adapt and get accustomed to the brace, which means they can lose strength, which can lead to more injuries,"" he adds. ""If you use the back brace for more than two weeks, you can become brace-dependent."" A lumbar support device can be useful in the short term, but strengthening the core muscles that support your back is important in the long run, Bautch says. 4. Learn your capacity. Figure out your physical limits to avoid reinjuring your back – both when you're wearing a back brace and after you've stopped using it, says Robert Shapiro, a physical therapist and certified orthopedic manual therapist based in Huntington, New York. ""You're not Superman when you're wearing your brace,"" he says. Exceeding your physical boundaries could cause a recurrence of low back pain. ""You have to learn what your limits are and not to exceed them,"" Shapiro says. ""You may be able to lift a box of books, but shoveling snow may cause pain. Your physical limits may change as you exercise and strengthen your core.""",0,story_reviews_00305

Dr. Bisgaard said it was not possible to tell from the study whether pregnant women could benefit from simply eating more fish. Pregnant women are generally advised to limit their consumption of certain types of fish like swordfish and tuna because they contain mercury. But many other types are considered safe, especially smaller fish like sardines that are not at the top of the food chain and therefore not likely to accumulate mercury and other contaminants from eating other fish. The results were published in The New England Journal of Medicine. The scientists bought fish oil from a company that makes it, but they said the company had no role in the study. The research was paid for by the Danish government and private foundations. An editorial in the same journal by an expert who was not part of the study praised the research, saying it was well designed and carefully performed. The author of that editorial, Dr. Christopher E.

"In findings that could pry open a door closed for nearly half a century, researchers have found that psilocybin — a hallucinogen long used in traditional healing rituals — eases the depression and soothes the anxiety of patients contending with serious illness and the prospect of imminent death. In two separate studies published Thursday, researchers report that trial subjects who received a single moderate-to-large dose of psilocybin got substantial and lasting relief from their profound distress. Among 80 cancer patients who participated in the two trials, as many as 4 in 5 continued to feel measurably less hopeless and demoralized six months after taking the drug than they had upon their recruitment. And even years later, many reported they had gained — and retained — a profound sense of peace and meaning from the experience. Of 29 cancer patients who got psilocybin in a trial conducted at New York University's Langone Medical Center, 20 rated it as ""among the most meaningful"" events of their life. ""This drug saved my life and changed my life,"" said Dinah Bazer, a Brooklyn, N.Y., woman who was administered a single dose of psilocybin at a New York treatment center in 2011. Advertisement In the wake of treatment for ovarian cancer, Bazer said, her anxiety at the prospect of its return was ""eating her alive."" Under the influence of a single high dose of psilocybin, Bazer said Wednesday, she became ""volcanically angry"" as she visualized her cancer as a dark mass bearing down on her. With an epithet, she then saw herself throwing it off. ""I was bathed in God's love"" for hours after that, said Bazer, who describes herself as an atheist. When the psilocybin's hallucinatory effects wore off, she said, two years of intense anxiety were simply gone. ""This is a groundbreaking result,"" said Dr. George Greer, medical director of the Heffter Research Institute, the nonprofit organization that funded the two trials. Greer suggested that the ""existential anxiety"" of the terminally ill is only one of many conditions that psilocybin may one day treat. Others may include treatment-resistant depression, addiction to cocaine, alcohol or tobacco, obsessive-compulsive disorder and ""demoralization"" in long-term survivors of HIV, he said. Advertisement Johns Hopkins University psychiatrist Dr. Roland R. Griffiths, the lead author of one of the two studies, said the enduring relief provided by a single dose of psilocybin makes such treatment more akin to surgery than it does to the plodding, labor-intensive treatments that remain the mainstay of his profession. ""I really don't think we have any models in psychiatry that look like"" the effects demonstrated in the two trials, said Griffiths. ""Something occurs and it's repaired and it's better going forward … very plausibly for more than six months,"" he added. ""In that sense it's a new model."" The publication of the two early trials, in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, marks an American return to research on the therapeutic use of hallucinogenic drugs after a hiatus of 50 years. In the 1950s and '60s, hallucinogenic drugs such as lysergic acid diethylamide — LSD — and psilocybin, which is found naturally in certain mushrooms, were widely used in U.S. biomedical research and in psychotherapy practices. But in 1966, as the psychedelic drugs gained a broad counterculture following in the United States, the U.S. government declared any use of the drugs illegal. By the 1970s, that ended all American research on their potential therapeutic benefits. In recent years, a small clutch of American researchers, including the authors of the two new papers, have argued that such prohibitions might be preventing the discovery of better treatments for widespread and pressing psychiatric problems, including depression, addiction and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). With PTSD epidemic among U.S. combat veterans and drug addiction a national scourge, American officials have indicated a new willingness to allow research to proceed on psychedelic and other drugs long classified as having no legitimate medical use. On Tuesday, the Food and Drug Administration gave its blessing to conducting large-scale clinical trials of an experimental medication — 3,4-methylenedioxymethamphetamine — better known as the party drug ecstasy. Like LSD and psilocybin, ecstasy appears to hold promise as an adjunct to psychotherapy in the treatment of PTSD. If the resulting Phase 3 trials of ecstasy demonstrate their effectiveness, the next step could be FDA approval of ecstasy as a prescription drug. Advertisement The newly published trials of psilocybin are not quite so far advanced. Both studies were considered Phase 2 clinical trials, in which the safety and dosing regimens of a potential medication are still being tested. But both were considered to be double-blind placebo trials — the gold-standard of medical research in which subjects are left to guess whether they have gotten the active study drug or an inactive lookalike. In one of the trials, researchers used a very low dose of psilocybin, much lower than that required to induce hallucinations, as a placebo. In the other, they used the dietary supplement niacin. In each trial, all of the subjects got a high dose of psilocybin in one of two sessions. So all, in the end, experienced the full effects of the drug. All subjects in both trials had been diagnosed with cancer, and with ""existential anxiety or depression"" resulting from the illness and the likelihood of an early death. Participants were extensively prepared for the expected effects of the psilocybin. To minimize adverse reactions, researchers closely monitored the subjects while they were under the influence of the drug or the placebo. Afterwards, psychotherapists encouraged the subjects to write down and reflect upon the experience. Immediately after, as well as five weeks after their first session, subjects who got the psilocybin first looked much better than did those who got the placebo first. A wide range of standardized measures of depression, anxiety and quality of life showed that these subjects were less hopeless, less demoralized and less anxious. Six months out, 87% of those in the trial conducted at New York University/Langone reported their life satisfaction and/or well-being had been improved by the experience. In the larger of the two trials, conducted at Johns Hopkins University, psilocybin produced ""large and significant … increases in measures of quality of life, life meaning, death acceptance, and optimism"" — effects that ""were sustained at six months."" Psilocybin's side effects, meanwhile, were pretty tame. In the two trials, about 15% of subjects experienced nausea or vomiting when getting a high dose, and about 1 in 3 experienced some form of transient psychological discomfort. Many subjects' heart rates and blood pressure rose, but none to a dangerous extent. The potential use of psilocybin in patients diagnosed with life-threatening diseases comes at a moment when medical care at the end of life is a subject of growing concern among patients and physicians. Research finds it's still common for dying patients to get painful and futile procedures. Palliative and hospice care, both aimed at easing the discomfort of the seriously ill, are growing specialties in American hospitals. An increasing number of patients, meanwhile, are demanding the right to die with a physician's help. As states debate these physician-assisted suicide bills, they should consider the implications of finding an effective treatment for the ""existential distress"" of the dying, said Dr. Craig D. Blinderman, a palliative care specialist at Columbia University Medical Center/New York Presbyterian Hospital. Advertisement ""It would seem to me, before we get to that point, we should explore approaches like psilocybin and hopefully not consider [physician-assisted suicide] as their only option,"" said Blinderman, who was not involved in either of the two studies published Thursday. But finding drugs like psilocybin effective is by no means the final hurdle to their widespread availability. None are currently in production, and no for-profit pharmaceutical company would likely invest millions of dollars to bring to market a pill intended effectively for one-time use. Dr. Greer said that, in addition to ""incubating the next generation of researchers"" to explore the healing effects of psychedelic compounds, the New Mexico-based Heffter Institute is pondering a future in which specialized psychiatric clinics have routine access to psilocybin for treating patients. The institute is laying plans to scale up the production and distribution of a synthetic form of psilocybin that could make such treatments available at low cost to patients who could benefit from the drug, he said. melissa.healy@latimes.com Follow me on Twitter @LATMelissaHealy and ""like"" Los Angeles Times Science & Health on Facebook.

"U.S. prisons are experimenting with a high-priced monthly injection that could help addicted inmates stay off opioids after they are released, but skeptics question its effectiveness and say the manufacturer has aggressively marketed an unproven drug to corrections officials. A single shot of Vivitrol, given in the buttocks, lasts for four weeks and eliminates the need for the daily doses common with alternatives such as methadone. But each shot costs as much as $1,000, and because the drug has a limited track record, experts do not agree on how well it works. Proponents say Vivitrol could save money compared with the cost of locking up a drug offender — about $25,000 a year for each inmate at the Sheridan Correctional Center, 70 miles southwest of Chicago. New drug offered to addicted inmates combats opioid epidemic Dr. Joshua Lee, of New York University's medical school, said more evidence is needed to determine whether the medication can help substantial numbers of people and whether it's worth paying for, but the early results are encouraging. ""It sounds good, and for some of us, it feels like the right thing to do,"" said Lee, a leading researcher on the treatment. Vivitrol is emerging as the nation searches for ways to ease an opioid epidemic that affects more than 2 million Americans and an estimated 15 percent of the U.S. prison population. Many experts view prisons — where addiction's human toll can be seen most clearly — as a natural place to discover what works. Christopher Wolf had already served prison time for nonviolent crimes when he was ordered into treatment for a heroin addiction by a judge who suggested Vivitrol. Three months later, the 36-year-old from Centerville, Ohio, is clean and working full time as a cook. He now suggests the medication to other addicts. ""I don't have cravings,"" Wolf said. ""I see how much better life is. It gets better really fast."" Vivitrol targets receptors in the brain's reward system, blocking the high and extinguishing urges. In some programs, prisoners get an injection before release, then follow-up shots from any clinic. For decades, researchers have recognized addiction as a relapsing brain disease with medication an important part of therapy. But most jails and prisons reject methadone and buprenorphine, the other government-approved medications for opioid addiction, because they are habit-forming and can be abused. Just ask Joshua Meador, 28, an inmate at Sheridan who hopes to get into the Vivitrol program before his release in January. Before incarceration, he abused both older treatment drugs. When given take-home doses of methadone for the weekend, he would sell them for heroin. ""When I'm on Vivitrol, I can't get high,"" he said. The drug has no street value or abuse potential. ""You couldn't design something better for the criminal justice system,"" said David Farabee of the University of California at Los Angeles, who leads a Vivitrol study in a New Mexico jail. ""There's been pushback with other medications, people saying, ‘We're just changing one drug for another.' That argument goes out the window when you're talking about a blocker"" like Vivitrol. Prison systems in Illinois, Vermont, Wyoming and Wisconsin are trying the drug on a small scale. Michigan is offering Vivitrol to parolees who commit small crimes, if addiction is the reason for their new offense. The federal Bureau of Prisons ran a field trial in Texas and plans to expand the program to the Northeast next year. The drug's manufacturer hopes prisons will be the gateway to a larger market. Also known as extended-release naltrexone, the medication won Food and Drug Administration approval for alcohol dependence in 2006 and in 2010 to prevent relapse in post-detox opioid users. The evidence for giving Vivitrol to inmates is thin but promising. In the biggest study, sponsored by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, about 300 offenders — most of them heroin users on probation or parole — were randomly assigned to receive either Vivitrol or brief counseling and referral to a treatment program. After six months, the Vivitrol group had a lower rate of relapse, 43 percent compared with 64 percent. A year after treatment stopped, there had been no overdoses in the Vivitrol group and seven overdoses, including three deaths, in the other group. The results, published in March in the New England Journal of Medicine, have been promoted by the drugmaker, Ireland-based Alkermes, as it markets Vivitrol to U.S. correctional systems. Yet addiction is stubborn. When the injections stopped, many in the study relapsed. A year later, relapse rates looked the same in the two groups. ""It does suggest six months wasn't enough,"" said Lee, the lead author. T.J. Voller was a Vivitrol success story — until he wasn't. After Vivitrol was approved by the FDA, Voller talked about getting the shot with The Associated Press and Dr. Sanjay Gupta in a CNN segment. The 30-year-old was back at work and seemed proud of his recovery. But after 10 months on Vivitrol, he died of a heroin overdose. ""He was alone for the weekend and picked up that needle one last time,"" said his mother, Kathi Voller of Raynham, Massachusetts. Advocates argue that inmates have a constitutional right to all FDA-approved addiction medications throughout their incarceration. ""Treatment should be offered from the moment they are brought into the system,"" said Sally Friedman, legal director of the New York-based Legal Action Center, which is looking for a test case to bring to court. Physicians have learned to be cautious about pharmaceutical company marketing, said Andrew Kolodny, senior scientist at the Heller School for Social Policy and Management at Brandeis University. Not so for criminal justice officials, who may be too trusting, Kolodny said. ""When the drug company sends someone in to give them a talk and buy them pizza, they think they're getting a scientific lecture,"" he said. Alkermes spokeswoman Jennifer Snyder said the company's sales team helps educate corrections staff and community care providers only after they have shown interest in Vivitrol. There's widespread agreement that counseling, support groups and treatment for underlying problems such as depression are crucial for Vivitrol patients, said Dr. Joseph Garbely of Pennsylvania-based Caron Treatment Centers, which supports medication-assisted treatment and prefers Vivitrol. ""The disease of addiction is a cunning, baffling and powerful one,"" Garbely said. ""And you need all hands on deck.""",0,story_reviews_00328
"The genetic legacy each of us inherits is a powerful force -- and in a few extreme cases, it can be deadly. Still, thanks to science, genetics need not always be destiny, as Martha Teichner shows us in our Cover Story: Amy and Brad Price's home in Omaha, Nebraska, is crazy with all the kids around. There are seven of them, ages 2 to 11. But if you look closely, you'll see small memorials to one more: Liviana, who died in 2013 at the age of 5½ of a rare, nightmare disease called late infantile metachromatic leukodystrophy. MLD destroys brain cells and is caused by a single, faulty gene. ""She was happy all the time,"" Brad said. Amy added, ""She loved pretty dresses."" ""She loved her tutu,"" Brad said. She was talkative, addicted to ""Caillou,"" the animated TV series, a lively little girl, ‘til she was two. ""Her knees were going a little knock-kneed,"" Amy said. ""And she had been just randomly falling down."" Her doctor said, ""Nothing to worry about,"" but she quickly got worse. ""I was in the kitchen doing something and I heard her crying,"" Amy recalled. ""And I turned around and said, ‘Liviana, what's wrong?' And she said, ‘Mommy, my legs don't work.'"" Liviana was diagnosed in the fall of 2010. Amy recalled: ""She's sitting on the bed in her tutu and her colorful sweater, and they're telling me she's gonna die."" Many children with the disorder are dead by the age of 6. And it runs in families. If it hadn't been for Liviana, Amy and Brad Price would never have known to have their other children tested. They learned that their infant son, Giovanni, had inherited the faulty gene, too. ""I get a call from the doctor's office,"" said Amy, ""I knew. And I was thinking, ‘I've just been told two of my kids now are gonna die.'"" Except that's not what happened. Doing research online, Amy Price discovered the existence of a medical trial in Milan, Italy, of an extraordinary gene therapy treatment for MLD that would save Giovanni's life -- and later, when his sister, Cecilia, was born with MLD, hers, too. The treatment works only on children who, like them, have not yet started showing symptoms. The Price family scraped together the money to go to Milan. ""The patients go to the surgery room for collection of the stem cells on Monday, and receive their cells back on Friday evening,"" said Dr. Alessandra Biffi, who oversaw the trial. A patient's stem cells contain the faulty gene, which the doctors have learned how to fix. Amazing, right? But then they need a vehicle to insert the good gene into the stem cells before those are put back into the patient's body. Here's what's really amazing: That vehicle is the HIV virus, re-engineered so the children can't get AIDS. Why the HIV virus? ""Is it particularly efficient at getting around the body?"" Teichner asked. ""Yeah, it's very efficient in entering our cells, and that's why we use it,"" Dr. Biffi replied. How well did the children do? It will take years to know for sure, but so far so good. ""At least 70-80% of them have an outstanding benefit coming from the treatment,"" Dr. Biffi said. ""Some of the children were going to school and having a normal life."" Giovanni Price is six now, in first grade. He and his sister Cecilia (Ceci for short) have to go back to Milan twice a year to be tested and monitored. Brad Price calls Dr. Biffi ""Our angel. She took us in like family."" So why Italy, and not the United States? Gene therapy has a checkered history. In the 1990s, hyped as the Next Big Thing, research withered here after serious setbacks, including a death during clinical trials. But more than 15 years later, it's back. One sign: Dr. Biffi is now head of the gene therapy program at Dana-Farber/Boston Children's Cancer and Blood Disorders Center. Teichner asked, ""Do you believe that gene therapy is finally coming into its own?"" ""I think yes, absolutely,"" Dr. Biffi replied. The MLD trial, she thinks, demonstrates what's possible -- offering promise to the 30 million Americans who suffer from some 7,000 rare diseases. Trials for the experimental treatment Ceci and Giovanni Price received in Milan have not begun in the U.S. They are two of only 24 children in the world with MLD to receive it. Compare Giovanni to Calliope Joy Carr, also six, from Bala Cynwyd, Pa., outside Philadelphia. She can turn her head, a little. She can still smile and laugh. But that's about all. She was diagnosed at 2. For her parents, college professors Patrick Carr and Maria Kefalis, coming to terms with the disease was wrenching. ""It's decline in slow motion, and that's difficult,"" said Carr. ""I remember the social worker said, ‘It's good to try to cry in the shower to save it from your family and your children,'"" Kefalis said. After more than a year of rage and grief, Kefalis decided that she had to find some way of helping MLD children. It was too late for Cal, but she was desperate to give her daughter's life meaning. ""We're not wealthy people,"" she said. ""We didn't know very influential people who could write a big check for a million dollars. And so we said, ‘Well, we'll start selling cupcakes.'"" The Calliope Joy Foundation was formed in 2013. It's been slow going, but the money added up. And when Kefalis learned about the Italian trial, and the fact that Amy Price had to keep going back to Milan with Giovanni and Ceci, it was clear she would use the money to help families get to Italy. ""She sent me a picture of Giovanni playing in his front yard,"" Kefalis said. ""He's three months younger than Cal, so he should've been as sick as Cal. He should have been on a feeding tube. He should be paralyzed. And I thought, I gotta be a part of this. I need to help this happen again and again and again."" Maria Kefalis has turned cupcakes into weapons of war -- her war against MLD. She's raised more than $250,000, and helped where she could, but she's hit a wall. So far, not a single gene replacement therapy has been approved by the FDA. The trial in Italy is closed to new patients. It could be years before any children with MLD will be allowed to receive the treatment in the United States. ""Now, it's just impatience,"" Kefalis said. ""Now it's, like, ‘When do we get this here? What will it take. Tell me what you need me to do.'"" Until then, she continues to fight her battles one cupcake at a time -- the Price children, Giovanni and Cecilia, proof to her the war can be won. Teichner asked Brad and Amy Price, ""You keep using the word ‘miracle.' In what way is all of this a miracle?"" ""Our son's still with us, and Cecilia as well,"" they replied. ""That's the miracle.""

"COPENHAGEN (Reuters) - Merck & Co scored a double hit on Sunday with new clinical data showing its Keytruda immunotherapy offered big benefits in previously untreated lung cancer patients, either when given on its own or with chemotherapy. As a monotherapy, Keytruda halved the risk of disease progression and cut overall deaths by 40 percent compared to chemotherapy alone in pre-selected patients whose tumors had been tested using a biomarker. And when given with two older chemotherapy drugs in non-selected patients, it was almost twice as likely to shrink tumors as chemotherapy alone. Another similar drug from Roche also demonstrated broad efficacy as a so-called second-line option in patients who had received prior treatment. ""Remember this day. It's a new day for lung cancer treatment,"" Stefan Zimmermann of Lausanne's University Hospital told reporters at the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) congress as the results were presented. An editorial in the New England Journal of Medicine, where the Merck monotherapy results were published, said Keytruda could become ""a new standard of care"". The various findings suggest that treating lung cancer - the biggest cancer killer globally - with powerful new immune system-boosting medicines is going to involve more permutations than some experts originally expected. Rival drugmaker Bristol-Myers Squibb had tried a catch-all approach with its Opdivo drug but it failed to help previously untreated patients when given on its own in a trial that included people with low levels of a protein called PD-L1. Keytruda, as a sole agent, was targeted only at patients with high PD-L1, making them more receptive to immunotherapy. Lead researcher Martin Reck of Germany's Lung Clinic Grosshansdorf predicted that testing for the PD-L1 biomarker would now become standard ""from today"". U.S. regulators are expected to decide whether to approve Keytruda for first-line non-small cell lung cancer, the most common type, by Dec. 24. Merck had already said in June that Keytruda worked in the trial but the scale of the benefit was only disclosed at ESMO. COMBINATION THERAPY The second trial, mixing Keytruda with chemotherapy, was much smaller but was notable because it was the first time that a combination of immunotherapy and chemotherapy has been shown to work in a randomized Phase II study. Many experts have been skeptical about this approach and investors' expectations, up until now, have been quite low. In the event, researchers reported that Merck's combination cut the risk of disease progression or death by 47 percent compared to chemotherapy alone after 10.6 months, while 55 percent of patients saw their tumors shrink versus 29 percent. Patients in this trial were not selected by PD-L1 expression but the study did find that those with higher PD-L1 had a higher response. Roger Perlmutter, Merck's head of research, said both trials suggested Keytruda could offer a broad array of patients meaningful improvement over standard platinum-based chemotherapy, which is now more than two decades old. Drugs like Keytruda and Opdivo work by taking the brakes off the immune system and allowing the body's natural killer cells to home in on tumors. They are expected to sell tens of billions of dollars in the years ahead, with lung cancer the largest market. Up until now, Bristol has dominated the field but investors have started to shift their bets, with forecasts for Opdivo declining while those for Keytruda have risen. The current consensus forecast among analysts is for Keytruda sales to reach $8 billion in 2021, with Opdivo selling $10.5 billion, according to Thomson Reuters data. Results of Bristol's failed Opdivo trial, which included patients with tumors testing only 5 percent or higher for PD-L1 against the 50 percent cut-off used by Merck, were also presented at ESMO. These showed progression-free survival was 4.2 months with Opdivo and 5.9 months with chemotherapy, although the difference was not statistically significant. Overall survival was 14.4 months with Opdivo versus 13.2 months. The failure of Opdivo to work for ""all comers"" in lung cancer was first announced in August, without any details. It was a major setback for Bristol, wiping out around a quarter of the company's market value, and it has caused investors to rethink prospects for immunotherapy treatments. Many now believe that combination therapy is the way ahead, with Bristol and AstraZeneca working primarily on using two immunotherapies together, while Roche and Merck look at adding chemotherapy.",0,story_reviews_00347
"Artist Lorie Novak in front of work from her Migraine Register project, which documents all the time she's lost to debilitating migraines. It often starts with the aura. Zig-zagging lines come into view, everyday light becomes searingly bright, and vision starts to slip. These are signals that a debilitating migraine is on its way. ""It's like you're possessed,"" said Lorie Novak, who has suffered from chronic migraines since childhood. ""I almost feel separate from my body, like it's just this painful shell around me that's not me."" advertisement Novak, now in her 60s, is one of the roughly 35 million Americans who suffer from migraines. There are few effective treatments, and no new drugs have been developed since the early 1990s. But that could soon change. A handful of drug companies are pressing ahead with novel injectable therapies for migraines, chasing a blockbuster market that Wall Street analysts say could reach $8 billion a year in worldwide sales. The new drugs target a bodily protein called CGRP, which plays a role in the dilation of blood vessels in the brain. Scientists haven't nailed down just how the protein affects migraines, but they're sure about two things: CGRP levels rocket up when headaches attack and normalize when they go away. And thus four drug makers — Amgen (AMGN), Eli Lilly, Teva Pharmaceuticals, and Alder Biopharmaceuticals — have fashioned antibodies that can bind to CGRP molecules and block their activity. The goal: to relieve the scourge of chronic migraines by stopping CGRP in its tracks. So far, it seems to be working. In mid-stage clinical trials, each of the four treatments has eased symptoms for about half of study participants, cutting the number of days they're afflicted by migraines roughly in half. It's by no means a cure for migraines, but it should be enough to merit Food and Drug Administration approvals if the companies can replicate those results in larger trials, according to Eric Schmidt, a securities analyst at Cowen and Co. Each treatment is now in late-stage development, targeting the roughly 38 percent of migraine sufferers who, like Novak, have at least four headache days per month. The first therapy could hit the market in 2018, and, if everything works out, all four could available by the end of the decade. So far, the four drugs have performed similarly in clinical trials, and analysts expect the contenders will have to compete on price to grab market share. ""There will certainly be hypercompetition,"" said William Ratner, Lilly's senior director of global headache marketing. But the companies' fortunes are intertwined, he said, and ""the class only wins if headache care in America improves."" Aiming to prevent migraines before they start There's plenty of room for improvement. Existing therapies are plagued by inconsistent efficacy and troublesome side effects, and patients are often left to rely on a repurposed treatment for epilepsy. That medication, Topamax, has been dubbed dubbed ""Sleepomax"" by doctors and patients because it's also a heavy sedative. ""I'm very enthusiastic, as I think everyone in the field is, about having another treatment option for people with migraines,"" said Dr. Elizabeth Loder, a professor of neurology at Harvard Medical School and chief of the headache division in the department of neurology at Brigham and Women's Hospital. Targeting CGRP is not a particularly new idea. Researchers picked up on the protein's scent more than 30 years ago, and drug companies spent years trying to craft pills that might block its activity. Merck got all the way into late-stage trials with an anti-CGRP tablet, spending more than $1 billion only to find in 2011 that the drug had toxic effects on the liver and thus no future. With the ""exquisite sensitivity"" of an antibody, however, scientists believe they can block CGRP without triggering dangerous side effects, Alder CEO Randy Schatzman said. Because antibodies stay active in the body for weeks, the drug companies see their new products as preventative therapies, injected monthly or quarterly to keep headaches at bay. (Merck's failed pill, by contrast, was meant as an on-the-spot treatment after the pain started.) ""So in some senses, it's a paradigm shift,"" Schatzman said. But there are still hurdles to clear. Only about half of patients seem to respond to CGRP antibodies, and the companies have no way of predicting who they are ahead of time. A genetic test would be ""the Holy Grail of personalized medicine,"" said Rob Lenz, Amgen's global development lead for neuroscience, but no one has made one yet. And long-term safety remains a major question mark. To date, none of the companies has reported serious side effects in clinical trials, but they've only reported data from 12-week studies on about 1,500 total patients. It will take years to determine just what the new therapies do to the body over time, Loder said. ‘I felt like my life was being stolen from me' Any advance, even an incremental one, would be a major leap for the field, said Emily Bates, who studies the genetic causes of headaches at the University of Colorado and is not affiliated with any of the companies working on migraine treatment. Bates struggled with chronic migraines in high school and college. Like many patients, she didn't respond to any of the preventative therapies available. ""The pain is more than anything I've ever experienced, and I've run on broken legs before,"" she said. ""I felt like my life was being stolen from me."" Collectively, Americans miss about 113 million workdays each year because of migraine. That lost productivity costs society about $13 billion each year, according to the Migraine Research Foundation. Yet scientific progress has been slow, in part because migraine was long considered a psychosomatic condition not worthy of serious research funding, Bates said. It's a ""subjective symptom that predominantly affects women,"" said Loder, the Harvard neurologist. ""That's a perfect combination of things that make people feel able to dismiss it."" Novak, a professor of photography at New York University's Tisch School of the Arts, spent years trying to hide her migraines because of the stigma attached to the condition. But she decided to change all that in 2009 with a project called Migraine Register. She takes a photo of herself each day she has a migraine. Some years, that's more than 120 pictures. The idea, in part, was to humanize chronic migraines. But the project also forced Novak to reckon with the toll of the disease, something she had tried to ignore for years. ""That for me was like a concrete proof of how it really does affect my life,"" Novak said, ""of how much time I lose.""",0,story_reviews_00355
"Cancer cells remain elusive and tough to locate, but a new crop of nuclear-imaging tests promises to lead to more accurate prognosis and treatment. The tests use imaging agents that combine radioactive isotopes with targeted molecules that can spot cancer at the cellular level. The ability to accurately locate the cancers helps physicians make better and earlier diagnoses—and may eventually make possible targeted nuclear-medicine therapies that identify and kill cancer cells, but not the surrounding healthy cells. This summer, the Food and Drug Administration approved two such tests—one can trace slow-growing prostate cancer cells, while the other targets a rare condition where neuroendocrine cells develop into tumors. Advanced Accelerator Applications, a French pharmaceutical company that developed the test for neuroendocrine tumors, also is seeking approval for a drug called Lutathera that uses the same technique to zero in on the cancer that needs treating, says Chief Executive Stefano Buono. Finding the fuel Developed in the 1970s, nuclear imaging is used to reveal the body's metabolic activities (in contrast with static imaging, such as X-rays, which provide just a snapshot). Positron emission tomography, or PET, scans can be used to identify many common cancers, as well as Alzheimer's and epilepsy. But many PET scans aren't effective at locating certain cancers, including cancer of the prostate, the third most common type of cancer in the U.S., with more than 180,000 new cases and more than 26,000 deaths expected this year. That's because the most common imaging agent, known as FDG, uses glucose to locate cancer cells. Prostate and several other cancers don't use as much glucose, so the scans aren't effective for those diseases. The new tests pair radioactive materials with a receptor that reacts to a hormone for neuroendocrine tumors or, in the case of prostate cancer, amino acid, which is what fuels the disease. The result is a better view of the cancer. Spotting a relapse Blue Earth Diagnostics Ltd., based in Oxford, England, developed the prostate imaging agent, called Axumin, based on a molecule originally developed by Mark Goodman, a professor of radiology and imaging sciences at Emory University's School of Medicine in the mid-1990s. The agent was administered commercially for the first time in September at a hospital in Atlanta. With recurrent prostate cancer, the test's ability to locate cancer at the cellular level means that it can complement current diagnostic tests. Prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, is the common way to screen for the disease. But it isn't entirely reliable because the PSA protein count also rises with age and disease of the prostate like inflammation, and it doesn't help to determine the location of the tumor. That can be crucial in deciding on treatment. If the cancer is confined to the pelvis, surgery or radiation can be used to treat the disease. But if it has spread to lymph nodes or the bones, hormone therapy may be required. The test also allows for earlier detection of recurrent disease. An estimated 20% to 30% of men who are treated for prostate cancer will relapse after five years, according to the Prostate Cancer Foundation. ""The new scan can detect cancer with a relatively low PSA count, say, under 5, when the cancer may still be curable,"" says Mark Scholz, founder and executive director of the non-profit Prostate Cancer Research Institute. ""That changes everything."" There are other efforts seeking to screen for cancer on a cellular level. Genetic testing, for example, looks for inherited mutations in a person's genes to gauge the risk of developing hereditary cancer, and allow patients to be on guard even before any symptoms appear. Still, nuclear imaging can provide complementary information to these newer methods. For one, nuclear imaging can see how the tumor behaves in the body and its immediate environment and can be used to inform physicians about changes in the disease during the course of treatment, says Dr. Janet Eary, a deputy associate director at the National Cancer Institute's cancer-imaging program.

"The logo of Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis is seen on its headquarters building in Basel, Switzerland October 27, 2015. REUTERS/Arnd Wiegmann/File Photo LONDON (Reuters) - The first new asthma pill in decades has produced promising results in a small clinical trial, potentially paving the way for another treatment option for patients by the end of the decade. Fevipiprant, which is being developed by Novartis, reduced a biological marker of asthma nearly five-fold in the 12-week trial involving 61 patients, researchers said on Saturday. No serious adverse events were reported. Larger and longer studies are now needed to prove that the twice-daily pill can also reduce severe asthma attacks, known as exacerbations. Novartis believes the medicine could be filed for regulatory approval in around 2019. Pills for asthma used to be standard treatment 40 or 50 years ago, but those older products were often associated with worrying side effects. They have since been replaced by inhalers that deliver small amounts of drugs directly into the lungs. The Novartis pill works in a very precise way to block the action of inflammatory cells called eosinophils. The latest research, published in the journal Lancet Respiratory Medicine, comes at a time of considerable innovation in asthma care, with the recent launch of new injectable drugs for severe asthma that also target eosinophils. At the same time, many drugmakers are developing improved asthma inhalers, including ""smart"" devices with sensors that monitor use.",0,story_reviews_00381
"Many heart doctor will tell you that one of the best ways to keep your heart healthy is to include more healthy oils, such as omega-3 fatty acids found in fish, in your diet. Studies have shown that people in parts of the world who eat more fish have lower rates of heart disease, and fewer heart attacks (though the same can't necessarily be true of those who take supplements—see this piece ""Fish Oil Is Hugely Popular—But Should You Take It? for more on that). One thing that has been less clear is what role fish oil plays in people who have already had a heart attack. Can omega-3 fat provide similar benefit? Researchers led by Dr. Raymond Kwong at Brigham and Women's Hospital wanted to find out, so they took advantage of more sophisticated imaging techniques that can provide detailed pictures of the heart and how it's changing in the days and weeks after a heart attack. Health Newsletter Get the latest health and science news, plus: burning questions and expert tips. View Sample Sign Up Now For the study, published in the journal Circulation, they studied nearly 360 people who recently had a heart attack, who were randomly assigned to take 4g of omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo pill for six months. (That's a high dose; a 3 oz. portion of salmon contains anywhere from half a gram to 1g of omega-3.) Every two months, the volunteers came in for an MRI of their heart to track how much the muscle was changing. Normally after a heart attack, part of the heart is starved of oxygen, and that portion never recovers. The remaining healthy tissue starts to compensate for the compromised tissue, but has to work harder to maintain the heart's normal pumping function. Over time, this overworking can lead to scar tissue and start to restrict even the healthy tissue's ability to do its job. Kwong and his team found that people taking the high dose of omega-3 fats showed 6% less of this decline in heart function than those taking placebo. What's more, the people who showed the highest blood levels of the omega-3 fats (people absorb it at different rates) showed the greatest reduction in scarring — 13% — compared to those with the lowest levels. The effects remained strong even after the researchers accounted for the fact that all of the people were taking standard heart disease treatment drugs, including cholesterol-lowering statins and blood pressure medications. ""The omega-3 fatty acids seem to be preventing scarring of the otherwise healthy muscle that now has to overwork because of the heart attack,"" says Kwong. Based on analysis of their blood samples, the people taking omega-3 supplements also showed lower levels of inflammatory markers, which suggests that the fish oil may be working by reducing inflammation following a heart attack. It's the first encouraging strategy for protecting the heart after a heart attack; the more remaining healthy tissue that can be saved, the stronger the heart will be. Kwong says that the findings are only the first step toward considering whether omega-3 fatty acid supplements should be part of every emergency heart attack response. The 4g is a high dose; previous studies in which people were given 1g of fish oil were more inconsistent. Most of the people also started taking the supplements two to four weeks after their heart attack. Might they have benefit more if they had started taking the supplements sooner? How much omega-3 is needed to start remodeling the heart in a beneficial way? These are questions Kwong and others hope to answer with more studies. Kwong collected blood samples from the volunteers and will be studying them for hints about how omega-3 fatty acids are working in the body after a heart attack. ""To say every [heart attack] patient should be taking omega-3 fatty acids right away is a bit premature,"" he says. ""But I do think it's logical that our results hold promise, and may reduce bad outcomes in patients after a heart attack."" Contact us at editors@time.com.",0,story_reviews_00384
"Brynne Henn, 26, leaned back onto a pristine white couch and settled white-and-red headphones over her ears. She picked up a handset, grasping one buzzer in each hand, closed her eyes, and the session began. The room was quiet. Through the headphones, Henn heard an alternating tone — first in the right ear, then the left, back and forth. The handset buzzed in synchrony, right-left-right-left, part of a trauma treatment that also involves recalling painful memories. She turned her thoughts to the day her brother, Nate, died. Nate Henn had been visiting relatives and working with Invisible Children, a nonprofit in Kampala, Uganda. On July 11, 2010, he was at a sports complex with friends, enjoying the broadcast of a World Cup soccer match, when terrorists struck. Nate was only 25 when shrapnel from a bomb ended his life. The years hadn't diminished Brynne Henn's pain. "" ‘Your brother's dead, and you need to come home to take care of your mom,' "" she remembered her father saying. With those simple words, her brother was gone — and she felt compelled to take control in the ensuing chaos. Henn, who had been visiting her boyfriend in Chapel Hill, immediately returned home to Raleigh, N.C. ""I didn't stop for the first week after Nate died,"" she said. The ordeal didn't end with the news of Nate's death. Her other brother, Kyle, rushed home from Delaware to be with the family. But the private plane carrying him crashed the next day in nearby Chapel Hill. The pilot was killed and the co-pilot was seriously injured, but Kyle survived. ""And then the media storm went crazy,"" Henn said. The family already had received inquiries from journalists about Nate's death; Kyle's brush with death only intensified the interest of media outlets from Philadelphia to Raleigh. ""It made it so much worse,"" Henn said. At age 20, she began functioning as the family spokeswoman. ""I felt like I had to protect my family from all of it,"" she said. She occupied herself with press inquiries and funeral arrangements. But after the whirlwind passed, unaddressed grief remained with her. Complicated grief When a person experiences trauma, the associated memories can remain as vivid and urgent as on the day the event happened. The brain perceives the trauma as happening in the present and reacts accordingly, even in safe situations. When Henn's traumatic memories of her brother's violent death were triggered, they ""popped"" and glowed in her mind as if they were being shown on a projector screen. ""All these memories around me started playing like a video loop,"" Henn said. Her body remembered the sensations vividly: the heat and discomfort of the summer day, the pain of her high heels as she delivered the eulogy at the funeral. Henn did cognitive behavioral therapy — a form of conventional talk therapy — for five years. ""It helped me realize feelings were normal,"" she explained, and that she was not weak for reeling from the tragedy. ""But I never felt like I was getting over it."" Random memories could send her spiraling into panic and fear. Talk therapy helped her manage those attacks, but it didn't address the root cause. Henn was initially diagnosed with a condition known as complicated grief; she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder only last year. She was surprised. She had thought of PTSD as an affliction of soldiers and others directly involved in horrendous events — not of people like her, suffering from the ripple effects of a bombing in Uganda. It was Kyle Henn, recovering from his own PTSD after surviving the plane crash, who recommended eye movement desensitization and reprocessing therapy, or EMDR. Psychologist Francine Shapiro developed EMDR in 1987. Three years later, she founded the EMDR Institute, which has trained more than 100,000 practitioners. Some therapists use sounds from headphones during a session. Others use eye movement, moving a finger or object back and forth as the patient follows, eyes moving left to right and back again. Others employ a bar on which small bulbs light up from one side to another. Patients follow the light or object with their eyes or listen to the alternating tone while thinking about a specific traumatic memory or series of memories. They describe the memories to the therapist, who gives guidance as needed. The idea is that reliving the memories helps remove the sting and that the urgency of the memories can be reduced as the brain begins to move them from short-term to long-term memory. The sound or the eye movement is supposed to activate both sides of the brain in an imitation of REM sleep, when the brain usually converts short-term memories into long-term recollections. Studies have found benefits to EMDR. But there is debate about whether the eye movement makes a difference, said Stephen Holland, founder of the Capital Institute for Cognitive Therapy and co-author of the textbook ""Treatment Plans and Interventions for Depression and Anxiety Disorders."" ""The question is whether stimulation adds to it."" He does not use it in his practice because he considers it no more effective than cognitive behavioral therapy. Brynne Henn, who lives in the District, began seeing a licensed clinical psychologist who practices EMDR last September. In Gail Kalin's office, nestled in a tree-shaded apartment building in Northwest Washington, Henn confronted the trauma that still haunted her. The techniques associated with EMDR may merely have a placebo effect, some psychologists say. In early sessions, Henn focused on the headphones and handset; they helped distract her from the terror of reliving the traumatic events surrounding her brother's death, she said. This distraction had a positive effect on her, she said, allowing her to dive deeply into the therapy without freezing in the face of fear. Some insurance plans cover EMDR. Henn's does not; she pays for the sessions out of pocket. Henn, who is a communications associate at a Washington research institution, was initially very skeptical of EMDR. ""It is so weird,"" she said. ""When I first got there and she hands me these two paddles that vibrate in my hands, and then [I] put on these giant headphones — I was, like: What is this, a hearing test? What are we doing?"" But Henn was encouraged by the progress she made. ""I started getting really interested in it,"" she said. ""Why is my brain coming up with this? What in the world are you doing to me, that this is what I came up with?"" Henn was surprised by the vivid memories — some of which she hadn't known existed — that resurfaced after so much time had passed. Reliving the memories It didn't matter to her whether research supported EMDR; what mattered was whether it worked for her. Each time a particularly painful memory resurfaced, Henn said, ""you have to go through it again until it has no meaning."" By confronting the trauma head-on, she added, it became less powerful. ""It's integrating what's stuck in time,"" explained Kalin, the psychologist. Memories formed under the adrenaline of trauma are never put to rest, she said. ""EMDR processing is untangling the knot."" Once the memories are processed, therapists say, they are less vivid — less like the film reel Henn would see in her mind. Henn was able to recall processed memories without feeling panic. EMDR's central appeal lies in the possibility of closure — an end to PTSD, and to therapy for it. ""I'm going to come out equipped with tools to take care of myself,"" Henn said. She already has put these tools to the test: Two months after she started EMDR, terrorists hit Paris, killing at least 130 people. Soon after that attack, she heard reports that a video, possibly from the Islamic State, contained a threat to hit Washington next, and she had a ""full-fledged panic attack,"" she said. ""I was not sure where I was; I was sweating profusely but also really cold,"" she said. She stepped onto the 11th-floor terrace at work and looked down. ""The thought came into my head: ‘I just need to walk off, and that will wake me up,' "" Henn remembered. ""And I had enough awareness that I sat myself down and was trying to think of calming breaths and going back and forth"" — actions reminiscent of EMDR processing. ""It took a while, and it was a little terrifying that I had that thought,"" she said. ""But the process of being able to calm myself down was much better than anything I had been equipped with before."" In a few weeks, Henn mentioned to Kalin, she would be marrying her college sweetheart. Beneath the excitement, she felt a twinge of panic: How would she react to her brother's absence from the wedding? She asked a close friend to write a speech from Nate's point of view, as if he were speaking at the celebration. But Henn admitted she was worried that the speech would trigger an extreme emotional reaction, a fear shared by many who suffer from PTSD. They never know when the trauma will reignite; it can spread from the smallest spark, even on the happiest day. ""Does EMDR deal with the future?"" she asked Kalin. Kalin nodded, and they began processing memories again. Among the painful recollections, Henn encountered a happy memory — friends who arrived at the funeral to support the family — and a smile broke through the tears. ""It felt like a gift from Nate,"" she said. EMDR, Henn said, allowed her to have a do-over — to be able to grieve properly and then to move beyond grief. She was finally able to remember the good times with her brother without being overwhelmed by pain. ""I'm still sad, but I'm not hurt by it anymore,"" she said. ""It's not opening up any fresh wounds."" As Henn walked outside into a brisk April evening after her session, there was a new easiness to her, as though something had finally been freed.",0,story_reviews_00385
"By MARIA CHENG, AP Medical Writer LONDON (AP) — If you spend all day sitting on your rear end, then you might want to schedule some time for a brisk walk — just make sure you can spare at least an hour. Scientists analyzing data from more than 1 million people found that it takes about 60 to 75 minutes of ""moderate intensity"" exercise to undo the damage of sitting for at least eight hours a day. Not exercising and sitting all day is as dangerous as being obese or smoking, they found. And the added risk of parking yourself in front of a television for 5 hours or more a day after sitting at the office is so high even the hour of exercise is not enough to reverse the damage. ""We cannot stress enough the importance of getting exercise, whether it's getting out for a walk at lunchtime, going for a run in the morning or cycling to work,"" said Ulf Ekelund of the Norwegian School of Sports Sciences in Norway, one of the study authors, in a statement. It has been long suspected that sitting a lot, at work or at home, is not healthy. Previous studies have found that prolonged sitting can raise the chances of heart disease, various cancers and an earlier death. In the new research , experts combed through 13 papers with data on factors including how long people spend sitting, their physical activity levels and their television-watching habits. The majority of studies included people older than age 45. All except one were done in the U.S., Western Europe and Australia. Researchers found that people with the highest levels of moderate physical activity — 60 to 75 minutes daily— erased the higher risk of death linked to being seated for more than eight hours a day. But even that exercise regime was not enough to counter the hazards of also watching more than five hours of television a day. The paper was published online Wednesday in the journal Lancet. Lars Bo Andersen, who co-authored an accompanying commentary, called the new research ""very convincing,"" explaining that too much sitting increases the risk of problems including diabetes and heart disease because it can make insulin levels spike and might slow the body's metabolism. Andersen said that watching lots of television was probably even worse than sitting at the office all day because it likely includes other unhealthy habits. ""A lot of people don't just watch TV, they eat fatty snacks at the same time,"" said Andersen, of Sogn and Fjordane University College in Norway. Andersen said that some cultures make it easier than others to squeeze in an hour of exercise every day, noting that in Denmark and much of Scandinavia, about half of all people either cycle or walk to work. But he said that getting the recommended amount of physical activity shouldn't be overly arduous and doesn't necessarily mean going to the gym for an intense work-out. ""If you are walking and can feel yourself getting a little warm and your breathing is a little heavier, that's enough,"" he said. ""You don't have to be sweaty and out of breath to get the benefits.""",0,story_reviews_00386
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - A computerized brain training program cut the risk of dementia among healthy people by 48 percent, U.S. researchers said on Sunday in reporting an analysis of the results of a 10-year study. The preliminary findings, presented at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference in Toronto, are the first to show that any kind of intervention could delay the development of dementia in normal, healthy adults. To date, cognitive psychologists and neuroscientists have largely rejected evidence that computer-based cognitive-training software or ""brain games"" have any effect on cognitive function. The new findings would be quite promising if they hold up through peer review and publication in a scientific journal, said Dr. John King, an expert in social research at the National Institute of Aging. The institute is part of the National Institutes of Health, which funded the study. King worked on the original clinical trial on which the new analysis is based. The study, known as Active, examined the effects of cognitive training programs on 2,785 healthy older adults. Participants were divided into three groups. One got training for memory improvement, one for reasoning and one with computerized training in speed-of-processing. In the speed training, which emphasized visual perception, individuals were asked to identify objects on a screen quickly. The program got harder with each correct answer. Participants had 10 one-hour training sessions conducted in a classroom setting over five weeks. Some received four additional ""booster"" sessions one year after the original training, and four more two years after that. Scientists measured cognitive and functional changes immediately and at one, two, three, five and 10 years after the training to see if it affected how participants performed daily tasks. Results of that study, published in 2014, found modest benefits in the reasoning and speed-of-processing groups, but not memory. The new analysis was by Dr. Jerri Edwards of the University of South Florida, whose mentor, Dr. Karlene Ball of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, sold her rights to the program to Posit Science. Edwards also was a paid consultant for the company for part of 2008. The program is now incorporated in Posit Science's BrainHQ.com brain training program. Edwards did a secondary analysis of the 10-year data, looking at the time it took individuals to develop dementia. She found that the group that did speed training showed 33 percent less risk of dementia relative to the control group, while the memory and the reasoning interventions offered no such benefit. People who completed 11 or more speed training sessions were at 48 percent less risk for developing dementia over the 10 years of the study, Edwards said. ""At first blush, that's kind of a big deal,"" Mayo Clinic Alzheimer's expert Dr. Ronald Petersen said. ""This may even be clinically relevant."" In 2014, a group of nearly 70 neuroscientists and cognitive psychologists led by researchers at Stanford University's Center on Longevity and the Berlin Max Planck Institute for Human Development signed a letter saying there was ""little evidence"" of such results from brain games. The letter was in response to heavy marketing by companies touting the benefits of their programs based on scant scientific data. Edwards said she was frustrated with the scientific debate, which is one reason she agreed to present her findings before they were published. ""I'm sick of our studies being ignored,"" she said. King said the training offered in the program was slightly different from the current Posit Science offering and that it was unclear whether speed training would help people who are already at risk for dementia. ""It's a promising result from an interesting data set,"" he said. ""I do think we will know more after the paper is reviewed.""",0,story_reviews_00389
"Ferlistockphoto / Getty Images Getting pregnant can be tricky. One way an aspiring mother can make it easier is to know when she's most fertile, a period spanning a few days every month when her body undergoes hormonal changes. And certain body-tracking wristbands may be able to detect these subtle shifts in your biometrics, like your heart rate and body temperature. Depending on the device, it could even help you go one step further and actually conceive. Recently, the women's health data startup Clue ran an internal test to see if Fitbits could improve the experience of women who track their periods on its popular app and are trying to get pregnant. Scientists put Fitbits on five employees and found that the devices could track their resting heart rate patterns during their menstrual cycles. The devices also showed that resting heart rate spiked shortly before ovulation began, according to the Berlin company, which presented data from the small, preliminary study at the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology's annual meeting this month. ""It's a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant."" The advantage of a passive sensor is ""these things are done kind of autonomously so you don't need to do much except check when the resting heart rate starts coming up,"" Clue's head of scientific research, Dr. Vedrana Högqvist Tabor, told BuzzFeed News. ""It's a cheaper method for people who do want to get pregnant."" Fitbits aren't the only wearables that can track fertility-related biometrics in the background. After a Kickstarter campaign, YONO just started shipping an earpiece designed to track your body temperature at rest. And Ava is working on a smart wristband that aims to help women conceive. Fitbit How an Activity Tracker Caught an Unexpected Pregnancy Fitness trackers, by nature of being worn around the clock, have the potential to capture unexpected insights about how your body works — and simplify laborious acts like manually figuring out your fertile days. That traditionally involves taking your temperature when your body is at rest, examining your cervical mucus, and recording this data every single day on a calendar. Clue's study, which ran for 13 months beginning in April 2015, didn't set out to see whether the Fitbit ChargeHR could identify when a woman becomes pregnant. Rather, it was exploring whether the device could reliably track an already-known occurrence: how a woman's resting heart rate changes when she's experiencing rising hormonal levels linked to ovulation. For the experiment, five women under 40 wore a Fitbit ChargeHR to bed. That's because resting heart rate data can be captured at its purest when a person is asleep and not moving. The women also logged their periods on Clue's app, and took daily urine tests to track when there was a surge in the key hormones that signaled they were entering ovulation. Researchers were watching all these biometrics as the study participants went through their cycles. A woman's ""fertile window"" — when she's likeliest to get pregnant — usually occurs two weeks after the start of her last period, and lasts for about six or seven days, ending on the day of ovulation. Clue As the researchers had hypothesized, the participants' Fitbits captured a portion of this fertile window by showing that their resting heart rates rose one or two days before ovulation, as well as during ovulation itself. So a woman who saw a bump in her resting heart rate history could use that information to schedule intercourse with her partner, Högqvist Tabor said. And the study had one particularly unexpected outcome. Clue's marketing director, who was participating, was puzzled when her Fitbit said her heart rate was up by several beats per minute. Högqvist Tabor said she soon realized what the finding meant, and broke the news to the marketing director: She was pregnant. The happy discovery was similar to one earlier this year, when a man posted on Reddit about how his wife's Fitbit showed an uptick in her resting heart rate. Upon a Redditor's suggestion, she took a test that confirmed she was in fact pregnant. An expert told BuzzFeed News at the time that her heart rate increase may have been an indirect result of elevated body temperature, another symptom of pregnancy. But Don't Think Of This As Birth Control Even though Clue's marketing director happened to find out she was pregnant from her Fitbit, the point of the study was to demonstrate that it's possible to use Fitbit as a conception tool, not as a pregnancy test, Högqvist Tabor said. And that's provided that a couple doesn't have any other fertility-related problems. Manually figuring out your fertile days is a laborious, multi-step process you have to do every single day. However, Högqvist Tabor said, this information by itself should not be used as a birth control method. A woman will be fertile four to five days before her increased resting heart rate will start showing up on a Fitbit — so having unprotected intercourse during this period could in fact lead to an unintended pregnancy. If you're curious exactly what kind of increase in resting heart rate you should look out for, Clue hasn't revealed that information yet, but says it will publish that and other data in a paper later. (Högqvist Tabor says it's tricky because it depends on the individual, and can range from a few beats per minute to 10 beats per minute.) One reason to potentially shy away from trusting Fitbit's heart-rate sensors: In a class-action lawsuit, some unhappy consumers have accused them of being inaccurate. Regardless, Clue scientists say that they were more interested in the devices' ability to capture the day-to-day differences in someone's resting heart rate, which seemed to be consistent, and less interested in whether the devices could produce the exact values of resting heart rate. ""You will get a relative change, even though it might not be as accurate as a chest strap,"" said Clue co-founder Mike LaVigne. Daniel Winkler/Ava",0,story_reviews_00390
"Photo Obese children who cut sugar from their diets saw improvements in markers of heart disease after just nine days, a study in Atherosclerosis found. For the study, researchers evaluated 37 children ages 9 to 18 who were obese and at high risk for heart disease and Type 2 diabetes. The children were given food and drinks totaling the same number of calories, fat, protein and carbohydrates as their typical diets. The only change was their sugar intake: The researchers swapped foods high in added sugars, like pastries and sweetened yogurts, for options like bagels and pizza. This lowered dietary sugar from 28 percent to 10 percent, and fructose from 12 percent to 4 percent of total calories. After nine days, the researchers found a 33 percent drop in triglycerides, a type of fat tied to heart disease; a 49 percent reduction in a protein called apoC-III that is tied to high triglyceride levels; and large reductions in small, dense LDL cholesterol, a risk factor for heart disease. Though this study is small and short-term, it builds on this group's previous research implicating added sugars as a contributor to metabolic disorders and heart disease. ""Sugar calories are not like other carbohydrate calories,"" said Dr. Robert Lustig, a co-author of the study and professor of pediatrics at Benioff Children's Hospital at the University of California, San Francisco. ""Without changing total carbohydrate, or fat, or protein, we were able to accomplish this enormous improvement in their cardiovascular risk factors,"" unrelated to weight loss, he said.",0,story_reviews_00391
"Genomic Health Inc. has struck a deal to commercialize a new blood test that can help advanced prostate cancer patients decide whether to try costly new-generation drugs or rely on much cheaper traditional chemotherapy to improve their chances for survival. The test, developed by closely held Epic Sciences Inc., San Diego, detects a mutation associated with a poor response to two new drugs, Xtandi from Medivation Inc. and Astellas Pharma Inc. ALPMY -0.78% of Japan, and Zytiga from Johnson & Johnson. The two blockbuster drugs have significantly extended survival for many patients with advanced prostate cancer. But in a study published last month, patients who tested positive for the anomaly—a variant of the androgen receptor called AR-V7—lived substantially longer if they were treated with chemotherapy than those given the two new drugs. The receptor is the target of the new drugs. ""If AR-V7 was present, the patients didn't respond to the [new] agents,"" said Howard Scher, chief of genitourinary oncology at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center, New York. ""They progressed more quickly and they didn't live as long"" as those treated with chemo. Dr. Scher is lead author of the study, which was published online by the journal JAMA Oncology. The findings suggest that patients with the variant can improve their survival chances while avoiding use of the more-costly therapies. Xtandi's price is $9,370 a month while Zytiga's is about $8,600. Docetaxel and cabazitaxel, the standard so-called taxane chemotherapies for advanced prostate cancer, cost several hundred dollars a month, researchers said. ""You get both improved clinical outcome and economic benefits to the health system,"" said Murali Prahalad, Epic's president and chief executive. The retrospective study involved 161 men. Researchers said the test needs further validation in larger, prospective randomized trials. The companies believe the recent study, and previous research linking a poor response to the two drugs to the AR-V7 variant, are sufficient validation for clinical use, said Phil Febbo, Genomic Health's chief medical officer. They plan to launch the test early next year while more rigorous studies are under way. The price hasn't been determined. The companies estimate that about 50,000 U.S. patients a year have advanced prostate cancer that has progressed after standard hormone therapy and would be candidates for the test as they and their doctors consider treatment with the new agents. Studies suggest as many as 20% may have the AR-V7 variant, or acquire it as their tumors change during courses of therapy. The agreement bolsters Genomic Health's portfolio of cancer diagnostic tests intended to help doctors tailor treatment based on the molecular traits of their patients' tumors. Its OncotypeDX line of tests for breast, prostate and colon cancers gives patients with early-stage disease information on whether they're likely to benefit from chemotherapy—or in the case of the prostate, other aggressive care—as part of their treatment. The new pact is part of Genomic Health's plan to provide diagnostics to guide treatment for metastatic, or advanced disease. The test is called a liquid biopsy because it analyzes blood instead of tumor tissue to determine if the mutation is present. It is based on technology that cannot only detect AR-V7 but also determine whether it is in the nucleus of individual tumor cells. The presence of the AR-V7 in the nucleus is a key factor in whether patients respond to the new drugs, Dr. Scher said. In the study, no patient determined to have the variant in a single tumor cell's nucleus responded to either Xtandi or Zytiga. In the study, a positive test for AR-V7 didn't assure patients would respond to the chemotherapy, nor did a negative test promise a response to the Xtandi or Zytiga. Under the agreement, which covers commercializing the test in the U.S., Genomic Health is making an equity investment in Epic. Specific financial terms weren't disclosed.

"When I tore my rotator cuff in 2008, I had conventional laparoscopic surgery to repair it. The outcome was excellent, but the recovery was long and horrible. The orthopedist wouldn't let me drive for six weeks, or run, swim or lift weights for three months. I suffered through weeks of torturous physical therapy. It was nearly six months before I felt normal again. So in 2014, after a nurse improperly administered a vaccination that resulted in chronic pain and an MRI revealed another rotator-cuff tear, I vowed I would not go through shoulder surgery (or its aftermath) again. Cortisone injections and physical therapy didn't help, so I decided to try something else: platelet-rich plasma, a therapy that uses the body's natural healing properties to mend injuries. Its practitioners believe it will transform orthopedics. Based on my experience with it, I think they are right. It may not work for every condition, or for everyone. But it worked for me. [PRP therapy is popular for sports injuries, but does it work?] Before undergoing PRP treatment, I read quite a bit about it, learning that it holds promise for healing soft-tissue injuries such as tearing of the rotator cuff (the group of tendons and muscles that provide stability to the shoulder), tennis elbow, plantar fasciitis, Achilles tendinitis, patella tendinitis and hamstring tears; it may even provide relief for mild to moderate osteoarthritis. ""[PRP] works, and the results have been amazing,'' says John Ferrell, the sports medicine physician who treated me. ""There still needs to be more research done to perfect the process, but [it] will change the way orthopedics is practiced in the future. We will be more preventive. We will be able to treat ailments noninvasively, and at an earlier stage.'' The procedure involves collecting several ounces of blood from a patient's arm, spinning the blood in a centrifuge to concentrate the platelets and injecting the concentrated platelets into the injury site to stimulate healing. Platelets, the blood cells that promote clotting, contain hundreds of proteins, called growth factors, that are important in repairing injuries. ""PRP works by acting like a stem-cell magnet,'' says Ferrell, who practices at Regenerative Orthopedics & Sports Medicine, which has several offices in the Washington area. ""It releases growth factors that signal stem cells to come [and] help regenerate the injured area. Rotator-cuff tendon partial tears are notorious for not healing because of the poor blood supply there. PRP actually creates new blood vessels that feed the tendon the proper nutrients it needs to heal.'' A recent pilot study conducted at the Glen Sather Sports Medicine Clinic at the University of Alberta on rotator-cuff tears supports this. It showed tissue healing in five of seven of the patients who received PRP, as well as improvements in their pain and function. The researchers call the results ""clinically relevant,'' despite the study's small size, and say the next step should be a larger, controlled clinical trial. ""I've heard some skeptics call PRP a cure looking for a disease, but it is being used in so many areas of medicine now with promising outcomes,"" says Marni Wesner, a sports medicine physician at the clinic and one of the study's authors. ""The potential for benefit from PRP is real.'' I had my first appointment with Ferrell last October to find out whether PRP might help me. By then, my painful shoulder had been keeping me up nights for more than a year. It bothered me while swimming and lifting weights, and while getting dressed. By performing several tests to assess my strength and range of motion, Ferrell discovered that my left shoulder — the site of the tear — was considerably weaker than my right. He then used ultrasound to find the tear and showed it to me on a monitor. It turned out to be larger than indicated in the static MRI pictures I had obtained earlier. Before deciding whether PRP was right for me, he had to be sure that the tear was the source of my pain and weakness. He injected an anesthetic into the tear, then he ran the strength tests again. My strength was significantly better. This meant that the tear was causing my problems, and fixing it probably would restore strength and function to my shoulder and end my pain. I had the first PRP injection on Oct. 23. It was painful, and the aching persisted for about 36 hours. I had one bad night, followed by an uncomfortable day. After that, the pain stopped. Still, Ferrell advised me to baby the shoulder — to use my other arm when holding a dog leash and to skip swimming and weights for two weeks. Running was fine. He also recommended physical therapy after two weeks. After what I went through in 2008, those were restrictions I could live with. Ferrell told me not to use nonsteroidal anti-inflammatories, such as ibuprofen, for a week after the injection because the goal is to encourage, not stifle, inflammation. Other pain relievers such as acetaminophen were okay. ""We want to stimulate an acute inflammatory reaction, which will trigger the healing cascade to start to work,'' Ferrell says. Because there is not yet enough research on PRP — and because some studies have shown mixed results — insurance will not cover it. Still, ""it has significant cost savings"" compared with surgery, Ferrell says. The average treatment is two injections, which costs about $1,000 at his practice, whereas rotator-cuff surgery runs about $13,000, he says, although insurance often covers most of the costs of surgery. With additional research, insurance may ultimately pay for PRP. Unfortunately, there is little financial incentive to conduct such studies because there is nothing for the Food and Drug Administration to approve, such as a drug or device. The centrifuges already are licensed, and the procedure uses a patient's own blood, which is regarded as safe. The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons — which says PRP ""holds great promise'' — describes the risk as minimal. Those who seek this treatment must look for a clinician with considerable PRP experience — someone who does the procedure several times a day, not once or twice a month — and who has a good success rate, Ferrell says. Moreover, ""you see the greatest results when the injections are done under direct visualization with ultrasound,"" he adds. By February, the ultrasound showed my tear to be about 80 percent healed. The remaining tear was quite small. Ferrell recommended a second injection to finish the job. I had it on March 4. When I returned to see him on April 12, I was feeling pretty good. No pain, no problems. He rolled in the ultrasound machine, and I was not surprised by the results. The tear was completely gone.",0,story_reviews_00402
"A recent study has found evidence suggesting text messages could reduce one's odds of a second heart attack. A six-month clinical trial in Australia found that patients recovering from a heart attack were more likely to maintain lower blood pressure, less body fat and lower cholesterol levels than a control group when the patients received text messages asking and giving suggestions about their health routines. Patients receiving the texts also were more likely to be active and to quit smoking than the patients in the control group, who didn't receive such texts. Repeat heart attacks make up more than a quarter of all heart attacks in the U.S., according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Many of these attacks could be prevented by lifestyle changes. But while health systems have gotten very good at treating heart attacks, they struggle to connect with patients recovering from heart attacks after they return home. In the immediate aftermath of a heart attack, ""doctors dump a lot of information onto patients in a few days,"" says Clara Chow, leader of the study, who is director of the cardiovascular division at the George Institute for Global Health in Sydney and an associate professor at the University of Sydney Medical School. But after the initial flurry, Dr. Chow says, there is often little follow-up to make sure the patients follow through on recommended practices. ""Texts allow us to give support in bite-size chunks,"" she says. The six-month study in Australia included about 700 patients with coronary heart disease. Half of the patients received four text messages a week generated by a computer algorithm designed to be encouraging and give helpful advice, such as: ""Have you gone for your walk today, Jane?"" Or ""did you know 90% of people don't eat the recommended daily intake of vegetables (5 servings a day)?"" The other half of the patients received no such texts. After six months, the difference in blood pressure between the two groups was similar to what would have been achieved using a standard blood-pressure-lowering tablet, says Dr. Chow. She says that the differences in body fat and physical activity were also large—""comparable or greater than [would have been expected if the patients had been] attending a cardiac-rehabilitation program."" The effect on cholesterol level was smaller, less than 20% of what could have been expected if comparing a statin with a placebo, she says. While many previous studies have looked at the effect of text messaging on certain behaviors, this study stands out, doctors say, because it used objective measures, such as blood pressure and cholesterol levels, rather than relying entirely on self-reported metrics, which could be biased. Earlier studies also were often conducted on a smaller scale and over a shorter time—three months or less, says Shivan Mehta, associate chief innovation officer at Penn Medicine in Philadelphia. The length of the Australian study was important, Dr. Mehta says, because the first six months after a heart attack are a high-risk period during which new health habits are formed. Another advance, he says, is that the Australian study targeted multiple risk factors concurrently—smoking, exercise, diet and general cardiovascular awareness, rather than focusing on a single behavior. Dr. Chow is now attempting to replicate her results with a new study over a longer period and using a larger sample size. The new study will be run from more than 15 locations for 12 months and involve 1,400 patients. And unlike the earlier study, in which patients didn't have the opportunity to text back, this study will encourage participants to send questions to a health counselor. There will also be more focus on encouraging patients to continue taking prescribed medication. Experts hope that targeted text messages can also help patients with other severe and chronic diseases, such as diabetes, chronic lung disease and even mental-health illnesses, when patients require continuing support and lifestyle modifications. Texting also may be helpful in countries where patients don't have easy access to medical support. Ms. Ward is a writer in Mendham, N.J. Email her at reports@wsj.com.

"When you learn your child has brain cancer or another aggressive tumor, you're intensely focused on the immediate present. Which course of treatment – what combination of surgery, chemotherapy or radiation – will best help your child survive? But with most kids living long past their cancer diagnosis, it's also important to consider how treatments they undergo now may affect them later, even as adults. One choice some parents may face is whether to seek a newer type of radiation called proton beam therapy, instead of conventional X-ray radiation, to potentially reduce harmful side effects in their developing child. Proton beam therapy is considered a big advance in cancer therapy by some experts. Others, however, hesitate to get caught up in the early hype without more long-term evidence. Even so, people are traveling far and wide so their children can receive proton therapy from the handful of centers where it's offered. Four leading radiation oncologists explained to U.S. News what parents should understand about proton therapy and its possible benefits: Fewer side effects from cancer treatment is a major goal. (Courtesy of Mayo Clinic) Proton beam therapy is a form of radiation that may reduce late side effects compared with conventional X-ray radiation. The pinpoint beam and lack of exit dose – which is unneeded radiation as the conventional X-ray beam passes beyond the tumor and through the body on its way out the other side – spares healthy, normal tissue in developing areas such as the brain, heart and lungs. Childhood brain cancer is considered one of the most evidence-based uses for proton therapy. It may prevent late effects such as hearing loss or reduced ability to do well in school. However, at least for now, proton therapy does not offer a higher possibility of cure than traditional X-ray radiation. The brain is the most common area for kids to develop cancerous tumors that require radiation treatment, says Dr. Torunn Yock, director of pediatric radiation oncology at Massachusetts General Hospital and an associate professor at Harvard Medical School. ""Because the pediatric brain is still growing and developing, if you irradiate the brain during this process, it won't continue to grow and develop as it normally would,"" she says. ""And this over time leads to slowing of development, which shows up as drops in neurocognitive testing."" The younger the child, the more potential exists for stunted development, Yock says. ""A 2-year-old is very different from a 15-year-old in terms of brain development, so the adverse consequences are much greater in the 2-year-old."" Clearly, there's an advantage to not irradiating healthy brain tissue, she says. For instance, avoiding the brain's vision and auditory centers may save children from loss or impairment of sight or hearing. Proton beam therapy allows doctors to give the same dose as with traditional radiation, while reducing the dose – and complications – to normal, healthy tissue, says Dr. Sameer Keole, medical director of the proton beam therapy program at Mayo Clinic in Arizona. It also allows the use of a higher dose than traditional X-ray radiation (also called photon radiation) to treat resistant tumors, while still protecting surrounding tissue. With traditional radiation to the brain, the radiation scatters. ""That collateral radiation exposes large amounts of brain to low doses of radiation,"" says Dr. Thomas Merchant, chair of radiation oncology at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis, Tennessee. Even lower doses of radiation can be harmful, he adds. Massive proton beam technology behind the scenes. (Courtesy of Mayo Clinic) In November 2015, the new St. Jude Red Frog Events Proton Therapy Center – the world's only proton-therapy center dedicated solely to the treatment of children – began treating kids with aggressive cancers, including brain tumors and Hodgkin lymphoma. ""There are certain brain tumors in children where we have to treat the entire brain and spine,"" Merchant says. ""If we give proton therapy, we don't have exit radiation into the chest and abdomen that you have when you treat someone with conventional radiation."" That may reduce long-term side effects in the heart and lungs. With the newest form of proton therapy, called pencil-beam scanning – which conforms or shapes the highest-dose radiation to the targeted tumor – it's possible to reduce the ""margin"" area around the tumor exposed to radiation, Merchant says. That method, which is used by St. Jude, may eventually have the potential to reduce the risk of secondary cancers. Dr. Anita Mahajan, a professor and chief of pediatric radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, says when she describes proton therapy to parents, she emphasizes that proton therapy is radiation. The biggest difference, she explains, is that the subatomic particle, the proton, stops where the oncologists need it to. ""It has to get in, but we can stop it from coming out."" That ability to avoid other organs is important. ""For instance, if we're treating a young child for pelvic rhabdomyosarcoma [a muscle and connective tissue cancer], one of the things we might be able to do is avoid the growth plates in the femurs,"" Mahajan says. ""That might give you less problem with growth asymmetry of the legs as they get older."" Future fertility is a factor in cancer treatment planning. In cases involving radiation around the pelvic area, it's sometimes possible to avoid the ovaries in a young girl or the testes in a boy. 'Spaceship Hamster Wheel' A proton is a positively charged atomic particle. In proton therapy, a powerful machine called a particle accelerator speeds protons up to reach a high energy level. The technology is massive – three stories high and weighting upward of 100 tons – requiring special housing within a treatment facility to contain the equipment and deliver the proton beams. A rotating device called a gantry releases protons to the tumor from different angles. You can take a quick virtual tour of proton beam therapy at the Mayo Clinic in Arizona. Treatment room at St. Jude Red Frog Events Proton Therapy Center. (Courtesy of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital/Peter Barta) In the treatment room, patients are positioned on a table or in a specialized chair. CT or MRI scans are taken before each treatment to ensure accurate positioning. Some children need sedation to sleep through the treatment, while others who can remain still may stay awake. Patients may need immobilization devices to keep them in the proper, precise position for every proton-beam treatment. With brain cancer, patients usually wear a custom-fitted mask to maintain their position. Parents can accompany children to the treatment room and see them settle in before treatment begins, Mahajan says. A child life specialist is part of the team to help children and families cope with the entire patient experience. While the treatment itself is painless, side effects can include skin problems like swelling, dryness, blistering or peeling – similar to traditional radiation. Fatigue, nausea and vomiting are side effects as well and are also due to other treatments patients receive, like chemotherapy. Meg McQuillan of Riverside, Connecticut, recalls her son's introduction to proton beam therapy three years ago, when he was treated at Mass General for a type of brain tumor called medulloblastoma. He and fellow patients named the device the ""spaceship hamster wheel."" Young people take the treatment process in stride, Keole says. ""Kids are tough,"" he says. ""Sometimes they're a lot tougher than adults. By and large, they have a great attitude."" Cost and Access There are 23 operating proton beam centers in the U.S., according to the National Association for Proton Therapy, unevenly distributed throughout the country. Only a portion exist in the context of a pediatric-focused cancer program. Between 500 and 600 pediatric patients get proton radiation therapy each year, according to Yock's rough estimate. With a typical treatment course lasting six weeks, families face the disruption of traveling to a children's hospital with a proton therapy center, finding lodging and making arrangements for other children at home. Proton therapy costs roughly twice as much as traditional X-ray radiation. The average cost for a full course of proton radiation treatment is estimated at $40,000. Creating a new proton center is a huge investment. ""If you look at simply the upfront costs, it will be three to four times more expensive than photons,"" Yock says. ""It is absolutely intensive in terms of people and equipment needed and the quality assurance and the engineers and the physicists. It's a huge team that's required to run it safely, with good quality control."" Yock co-authored a study published in December 2015 in the journal Cancer, which compared the cost-effectiveness of proton radiation therapy versus traditional radiation among kids with medulloblastoma. The study, which used models to measure long-term side effects and related costs in treatment, work-force participation and quality of life, found that proton therapy was cost-effective. As Mahajan says, ""If we can prevent some neurocognitive deficits, endocrine issues, growth issues, skeletal deformities, those are going to help that child be more productive in society and need fewer medical interventions down the road."" Insurance usually covers the cost of proton therapy when a cancer is considered curable, Yock says: ""Ninety-eight percent of the time, we are successful with arguing to get a pediatric patient treatment,"" she says.",0,story_reviews_00410

"By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, June 1, 2016 (HealthDay News) -- If you find yourself hospitalized, you've got a one in five chance of needing a urinary catheter -- raising your risk for a urinary tract infection. Now, researchers report that a new program shows it might be possible to reduce both catheter use and its associated infections. ""Catheter-associated urinary tract infections are common and costly patient safety problems,"" said lead researcher Dr. Sanjay Saint. He is a professor of internal medicine at the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor. Roughly 250,000 such infections occur in hospitals each year in the United States, costing about $250 million, the researchers pointed out. Although about 20 percent of hospitalized patients get a urinary catheter, one-third of the time they aren't needed, Saint said. He believes that patients can play a role in reducing catheter use. ""A lot of patients and families don't realize that there are problems with a urinary catheter, so they may request them because they think it will allow patients to stay in bed,"" Saint said. ""Unfortunately, there are side effects with a catheter. And I've seen patients who have gotten up in the middle of the night and they trip and fall on the tubing,"" he explained. ""Patients and families should request that a catheter not be put in, and if there is one there, the patient should ask every day whether it is still needed,"" Saint suggested. For the study, Saint and his colleagues tried the new program in 600 hospitals. After 18 months of using the program, infection rates among hospital patients in general wards dropped by one-third, while catheter use had dropped about 1 percent. But there was no drop in infections or catheter use in intensive care units (ICUs), the study findings showed. Hospital-acquired urinary tract infection rates rose nationwide during the same time period, Saint noted. The program Saint helped develop -- called the ""bladder bundle"" -- includes protocols, checklists, training and information-sharing that help doctors and nurses reduce catheter use and prevent infections. Included in the program are: Daily checks to see if a catheter is still needed. Using other options to collect urine, such as bedpans. Training for managing urinary catheters. Use of infection-control techniques for catheter placement and maintenance. Feedback to the medical team about catheter use and infection rates. The researchers found that catheter infection rates in the new program dropped 14 percent overall in general wards (non-ICU). The findings were published June 2 in the New England Journal of Medicine. Dr. Susan Huang, a professor of infectious disease at the University of California, Irvine, wrote an editorial accompanying the study. She said, ""While we've known the correct care processes for managing urinary catheters, we haven't been able to reliably reduce catheter-related infections."" An intervention that focuses on changing the culture in hospitals to make them more responsive to the problem of infection control -- one that involves ""rallying around a focused problem and ensuring team-based solutions -- is integral to improving infection control in hospitals,"" she said. As for improving infection control in intensive care units, Huang said, ""further analysis may help us understand why this intervention didn't work."" ""This program can reduce urinary infections in hospitals if a team is assembled to ensure adoption of best practices and to rapidly correct reasons for failing to comply with these processes,"" she added.

"Scientists have raised the possibility of using statins – drugs used for reducing cholesterol – to stop some breast cancer tumours returning. The most common form of breast cancer uses oestrogen to grow. Drugs such as tamoxifen and aromatase inhibitors cut off the supply of oestrogen, reducing the chances that the cancer will return after surgery. But about 12,000 of the 40,000 diagnosed oestrogen-receptor positive (ER-positive) cancers still recur every year. Study points toward personalised treatment for breast cancer Read more Early research – most of it still in the lab – published in the journal Breast Cancer Research has shown that some early breast cancer tumours can produce a molecule made from cholesterol called 25-hydroxycholesterol (25-HC). It can mimic oestrogen and encourage tumours to grow. Dr Lesley-Ann Martin at the Institute of Cancer Research in London, where the research has been carried out, said: ""During the course of treatment, ER-positive breast cancers, that are ‘fed' by oestrogen, often become resistant to standard hormone therapy. Our research has demonstrated that these cancer cells can use a cholesterol molecule to mimic oestrogen so that they continue to grow without it. ""This is hugely significant. Testing the patient's tumour for 25-HC or the enzymes that make it may allow us to predict which patients are likely to develop resistance hormone therapy, and tailor their treatment accordingly. Our study also demonstrates that statins could be a valuable addition to breast cancer treatment, and that this warrants investigation in clinical trials."" The research has not yet been tested in humans. The scientists grew cancer cells in the lab in the absence of oestrogen and found they produced an alternative fuel, in the form of the cholesterol molecule. They then interfered with production of the molecule and found it slowed the cancer cells' growth by between 30% and 50%. The scientists say the findings are boosted by two studies which found the over-activation of certain genes linked to cholesterol production were linked with a poorer response to the anti-cancer drugs. Cholesterol production by the tumour will not be the only reason why ER-positive breast cancers recur, but campaigners are excited by the possibilities for a treatment if further research corroborates these findings. Delyth Morgan, chief executive at Breast Cancer Now, which funded the research, said: ""This is a really crucial discovery. Far too many women have to deal with the potentially devastating consequences of their breast cancer coming back and this research presents an important opportunity to improve the effectiveness of today's most commonly used treatments. ""This study breaks new ground in uncovering how some breast cancers continue to survive without oestrogen and suggests that women could benefit from adding statins to standard anti-hormone treatments. But this is early research and greater clinical evidence is now needed to understand the potential risks and benefits of this approach."" Another charity, Breast Cancer Care, said the research was promising but needed further trials. ""This early study raises an interesting question of whether cholesterol-reducing treatment, such as statins, could help lower the chances of breast cancer returning for some women who have developed a resistance to hormone therapy,"" said Jane Murphy, clinical nurse specialist. ""We know that many women can be consumed with fear of their breast cancer coming back, which can have a huge impact on their ability to move forward after treatment. This discovery may, in future, help reduce these concerns for some patients, by allowing doctors to test if their cancer is likely to return, and tailor treatment accordingly.""",0,story_reviews_00425
"An Online Program May Help Prevent Depression In Some People Enlarge this image toggle caption WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images WIN-Initiative RM/Getty Images Working through a self-help program online can prevent or delay major depression disorder in people who are vulnerable, a study finds. Similar programs have been used to treat depression, but this may be the first one tested to prevent it, the researchers say. Online programs for mental health problems can be as effective as face-to-face treatment and offer some advantages: Low cost, available at any time and customizable. But they're not panaceas. In this experiment, half of the participants were asked to do six half-hour-long exercises that were based on cognitive behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy, which are techniques commonly used for in-person therapy. In the cognitive behavioral therapy, participants were asked to identify positive activities they used to engage in and then are asked to actively plan those activities again. At the next session, participants reflect on their experiences. For the problem-solving therapy, people were asked to create a list of the things that matter most to them in their lives and brainstorm on how to incorporate those things into daily life. They next were asked to categorize problems and worries into ""manageable"" and ""unmanageable""; the main focus in problem-solving therapy is to tackle those problems that are considered manageable. Both cognitive-behavioral therapy and problem-solving therapy are intended to change negative thinking in order to alter mood and behavior. After completing each exercise, participants in the intervention group received written individualized feedback from an online trainer. The trainers did not offer any therapeutic advice, only motivation and encouragement to continue the exercises. Participants also could repeat the online sessions as often as they liked. The control group received information about depression but was under no obligation to read it. The study, which was conducted by researchers from Leuphana University in Lueneburg, Germany, recruited 406 people with subthreshold depression, which is defined as having some symptoms of depression but not enough to be diagnosed with major depressive disorder. It was published Tuesday in JAMA, the journal of the American Medical Association. Of the 406 participants that began the study, 335 completed the telephone follow-up at the end of 12 months. Twenty-seven percent in the intervention group experienced depression compared with 41 percent in the control group. It is unclear if the people who went on to develop major depressive disorder had experienced it before. Lead author Claudia Buntrock, a PhD candidate in clinical psychology at Leuphana, says that because the study only tracked participants' mental health over the course of 12 months, the long-term effectiveness of the intervention is unknown. It's also not clear if this kind of program could be scaled up. It took the trainers about 30 minutes to provide feedback for each session, and they also stayed in touch with participants via instant messaging, Buntrock says. Other experiments with online therapy have found that people didn't continue it if it wasn't guided by an actual human. One reason could be that when people are depressed, they can have a hard time getting motivated to do things. ""More studies are needed to evaluate the preventive effects of unguided web-based interventions on the onset of major depressive disorder,"" Buntrock wrote in an email. Still, Buntrock seems pleased with the results, especially since the German insurance company BARMER GEK that sponsored the trial is now providing it to its customers. ""I was surprised by the big response to our study,"" Buntrock wrote. ""And of course, I'm surprised about what happens now; that a health insurance company offers the intervention to its members. It's a success story you might dream of when you start, but it actually seeing to happen is a great feeling.""",0,story_reviews_00444
"After surviving firefights and a roadside bomb in Afghanistan, U.S. Army veteran Asa Barrett tried antidepressant drugs and therapy to overcome depression and bouts of anger. Nothing worked. But then, like many other foreigners, he journeyed to Peru's remote Amazonian jungle to drink ayahuasca, a centuries-old, sacred indigenous brew that some Western scientists think can help to heal psychological traumas. During a recent ayahuasca ritual, the 30-year-old from Oklahoma lay on a mattress with about 20 other travelers on the floor of a round, wooden hut in a remote resort near a tributary of the Amazon River. About 45 minutes after drinking the dark concoction, he began to see vibrant colors. He then vomited into a plastic bucket, a common reaction to ayahuasca. Mr. Barrett acknowledged that it didn't appear therapeutic. But he also described seeing visions of war-torn Afghanistan emerging as a shaman chanted spiritual songs called icaros. He recalled seeing bullet holes in a wall, a dead Afghan woman and the moment when an improvised explosive device almost killed him. He saw his small military base in Afghanistan's mountainous border region with Pakistan. He heard a loud voice. And then came a burst of light. ""It was as if I was just letting it all go,"" Mr. Barrett said later. ""I just felt so at ease for the first time in a long time."" In the Amazon, scientists have long studied plants with a range of medicinal properties. Some work as anesthetics; others can treat infections; some are known to stop bleeding. Now scientists are starting to look at ayahuasca, a potent hallucinogen known locally as ""the vine of the soul"" that outsiders are increasingly flocking to sample. Scientists say that ayahuasca—which is legal in Peru and neighboring countries—activates parts of the brain that make it possible to recall deep-rooted memories, increasing self-awareness and offering a chance to reassess past ordeals. Proponents say that it can provide users with spiritual and personal guidance. Others report that it has allowed them to overcome traumas that conventional therapy and antidepressants haven't cured. U.S. military veteran Asa Barrett at an ayahuasca center in the Peruvian jungle in January. Some Western scientists think the centuries-old, sacred indigenous brew can help heal psychological traumas. Photo: Ryan Dube/The Wall Street Journal But some scientists—and users—warn that ayahuasca can be dangerous. It can be fatal when mixed with other drugs, such as antidepressants, and should be avoided by those who are bipolar or schizophrenic, since it has been known to trigger psychotic episodes. In 2012, a young man from California died after taking ayahuasca in Peru. And last year a Canadian tourist killed a Briton during a nighttime ritual that local authorities are still investigating. The brew is made by boiling together a jungle vine called Banisteriopsis caapi with the leaves of a shrub that contains dimethyltryptamine, or DMT, a psychedelic that is illegal in the U.S. DMT can cause seizures and, in high doses, comas and respiratory arrests, said Mike Colston, a U.S. Navy captain who heads a Department of Defense agency in charge of studying psychological health and brain injury. The hallucinations caused by ayahuasca can be so traumatic that they can worsen medical conditions such as PTSD, Dr. Colston cautioned. In Peru, the influx of foreigners eager to try the brew has spurred the creation of unregulated new lodges to try ayahuasca, some of which, locals say, are opportunistic and employ fake shamans with little training. The brew itself is unregulated by the Peruvian government. Ayahuasca's proponents say that it has powerful properties. Jeffrey Hill, a 38-year-old construction superintendent from Chicago, said that ayahuasca eased his depression. Juliet Wilkerson, 41, who lives in Texas, said that it helped to cure her debilitating migraines, which she thinks were tied to childhood abuse. Jaylene Johnston, a 53-year-old from Oklahoma, said she had visions of her deceased first husband that allowed her to overcome the trauma of his death and fully commit to her current spouse. ""It transformed the relationships that I have right now,"" she said. The California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies aims to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the FDA for a study in the U.S. Photo: iStock The stories might seem surreal. But they have prompted growing interest by Western researchers, amid a wider revival of studies into the therapeutic use of psychedelics. The California-based Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, which has funded researchers at Stanford University and the University of Pennsylvania, plans to support an ayahuasca study in Peru this year for people with post-traumatic stress disorder. Later, the group hopes to get approval from the Food and Drug Administration for an ayahuasca study in the U.S. Jessica Nielson, a University of California, San Francisco, neuroscientist who is leading the study, became interested in the potion after trying it herself following a difficult divorce and doubts about her career trajectory. In Peru, she saw how it helped three military veterans. ""Just witnessing their transformation inspired me,"" she said. But she cautioned that ayahuasca research is in its infancy. ""We really need to get more data on this to understand the safety, what are the limits and who is it appropriate for,"" she said. Other scientists are hoping to understand the brew's properties. Charles Grob, a psychiatrist at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center who studied ayahuasca's use in a Brazilian church, says that it might help to treat addiction. Jordi Riba, a pharmacologist at the Sant Pau Institute of Biomedical Research in Barcelona, says that ayahuasca may help ease depression. Because the experience can be frightening, both men emphasized the importance of consuming the brew in a safe setting A.J. Bullock, a 30-year-old Army sergeant who served in Afghanistan, described nightmarish hallucinations of being chained down and confronted by demons after trying ayahuasca in Peru. It made him feel paranoid, he said, and he considered going home early. By his last ritual, he described a helpful, ""radical shift in self-image."" Still, he hesitates to recommend the experience. ""I just don't know if a lot of people would be able to walk away from it not having gone crazy or at least hurting them more than it helped them,"" he said. Despite the risks, foreigners are converging on Iquitos, a city of 500,000 in Peru's northeastern Amazon, paying up to $2,500 a week to drink the elixir. Carmen Rojas, the head of the local tourism office, says that she knows of 22 certified jungle lodges that offer ayahuasca. But local tour operators speak of dozens more, including almost 100 ayahuasca centers along one 60-mile stretch of highway. They estimate that as many as 80,000 people a year come to Iquitos for ayahuasca. One operator, Pulse Tours, says that its clients are mainly Americans and Canadians but also include people from as far away as Australia, China, Russia and Kazakhstan. Some longtime ayahuasca proponents in Iquitos lament the recent influx of tourism dollars, which they feel has corrupted the ritual and put some foreigners at risk from fly-by-night operators in the burgeoning industry. ""People have got way too careless about all of this,"" said Howard Lawler, 68, a Kentucky native who runs Spirit Quest Shamanic Sanctuary, one of the longest-running ayahuasca centers here.

"The growing number of patients who claim marijuana has helped them drop their painkiller habit has intrigued lawmakers and emboldened advocates. Many are pushing for cannabis as a treatment for the abuse of opioids and illegal narcotics such as heroin, and as an alternative to painkillers. It's a tempting sell in New England, hard hit by the painkiller and heroin crisis. But there's a problem: There is very little research showing marijuana works as a treatment for such addictions. Advocates argue a growing body of scientific literature supports the idea, pointing to a study in the Journal of Pain this year that found that chronic pain sufferers significantly reduced their opioid use when taking medical cannabis. Another study, published last year in the Journal of the American Medical Association, found cannabis can be effective in treating chronic pain and other ailments. The research falls short of concluding marijuana helps wean people off opioids - Vicodin, Oxycontin and related painkillers - and heroin, though. Many medical professionals say there's not enough evidence for them to confidently prescribe it. In Maine, which is considering adding opioid and heroin addiction to the list of conditions that qualify for medical marijuana, Michelle Ham said marijuana helped her end a years-long addiction to painkillers prescribed for a bad back and neck. Tired of feeling ""like a zombie,"" the 37-year-old mother of two decided to quit cold turkey, which she said brought on convulsions and other withdrawal symptoms. Then, a friend mentioned marijuana, which Maine had legalized in 1999 for chronic pain and scores of other medical conditions. Ham gave it a try in 2013 and said the pain is under control and she hasn't gone back on the opioids. ""Before, I couldn't even function. I couldn't get anything done,"" Ham said. ""Now, I actually organize volunteers, and we have a donations center to help the needy."" Bolstered by stories like Ham's, doctors are experimenting with marijuana as an addiction treatment in Massachusetts and California. Supporters in Maine are pushing for its inclusion in qualifying conditions for medical marijuana. Vermonters are making the case for addiction treatment in their push to legalize pot. Authorities are also desperate to curb a sharp rise in overdoses; Maine saw a 31 percent increase last year, and drug-related deaths in Vermont have jumped 44 percent since 2010. Vermont officials also blame opioid abuse for a 40 percent increase over the past two years of children in state custody. ""I don't think it's a cure for everybody,"" said Maine Rep. Diane Russell, a Portland Democrat and a leader in the state effort to legalize marijuana. ""But why take a solution off the table when people are telling us and physicians are telling us that it's working?"" Most states with medical marijuana allow it for a list of qualifying conditions. Getting on that list is crucial and has resulted in a tug of war in many states, including several in which veterans have been unsuccessful in getting post-traumatic stress disorder approved for marijuana treatment. This month, Pennsylvania became the 24th state to legalize medical marijuana. Sen. Mike Vereb, a Republican, called on lawmakers to take on what he called ""the number-one killer in Pennsylvania"" - opioid abuse. ""Opioid abuse has no party, has no color, has no religion,"" Vereb said. ""Let's face it, that's the killer. What we're doing today is the healer."" ""It's hard to argue against anecdotal evidence when you are in the middle of a crisis,"" said Patricia Hymanson, a York, Maine, neurologist who has taken a leave of absence to serve in the state House. ""But if you do too many things too fast, you are sometimes left with problems on the other end."" No place immune to America's opioid epidemic In New Hampshire, where drug deaths more than doubled last year from 2011 levels, the Senate last week rejected efforts to decriminalize marijuana. There are some promising findings involving rats and one 2014 JAMA study showing that states with medical marijuana laws had nearly 25 percent fewer opioid-related overdose deaths than those without, but even a co-author on that study said it would be wrong to use the findings to make the case for cannabis as a treatment option. ""We are in the midst of a serious problem. People are dying and, as a result, we ought to use things that are proven to be effective,"" said Dr. Richard Saitz, chair of the Department of Community Health Sciences at the Boston University School of Public Health. Cannabis could have limited benefits as a treatment alternative, said Harvard Medical School's Dr. Kevin Hill, who last year authored the JAMA study that found benefits in using medical marijuana to treat chronic pain, neuropathic pain and spasticity related to multiple sclerosis. But he urged caution. ""If you are thinking about using cannabis as opposed to using opioids for chronic pain, then I do think the evidence does support it,"" he said. ""However, I think one place where sometimes cannabis advocates go too far is when they talk about using cannabis to treat opioid addiction."" The findings in the Journal of Pain study that found chronic pain sufferers reduced their opioid use when using medical pot were limited because participants self-reported the data. Substance abuse experts argue there are already approved medications. It would also be wrong to portray marijuana as completely safe, they say, because it can also be addictive. But supporters point to doctors like Dr. Gary Witman, of Canna Care Docs, who has treated addicts with cannabis at his offices in Fall River, Stoughton and Worcester, Massachusetts. Since introducing the treatment in September, Witman said 15 patients have successfully weaned themselves off opioids. None have relapsed. ""When I see them in a six-month follow up, they are much more focused,"" Witman said. ""They have greater respect. They feel better about themselves. Most importantly, I'm able to get them back to gainful employment.""",0,story_reviews_00448
"(Reuters Health) - New data from centers that aggressively treat short-term ""mini-strokes"" offer new evidence that quick action can cut the odds of a serious stroke in half. The findings, reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, are more evidence of the benefits of sending someone to a hospital even if muscle weakness or slurred speech has only lasted for a few seconds, lead author Dr. Pierre Amarenco of Bichat Hospital in Paris told Reuters Health by phone. That's because mini-strokes, also known as transient ischemic attacks or TIAs, are often the harbinger of a potentially-deadly stroke that can come within a matter of hours or days. ""You should worry about symptoms even if they last for just a few seconds or a few minutes,"" Amarenco said. ""The study showed that the widespread, systematic implementation of specialized TIA units across multiple sites, countries, and continents can make a difference in the care of these patients,"" write Drs. Ralph Sacco and Tatjana Rundek of the University of Miami in an accompanying editorial. The ongoing study, which used previous stroke estimates for comparison, was based on data from 4,789 patients from TIAregistry.org, an international registry designed to follow cases for as long as five years. It didn't include a comparison group, which would offer the best evidence, but it ""helps build the evidence base for the importance of getting in for early treatment,"" said Dr. Donna Arnett, dean of public health at the University of Kentucky and past president of the American Heart Association. Any kind of mini-stroke ""should lead you to be evaluated,"" said Arnett, who was not involved in the study. Research reported prior to 2004 had suggested that the stroke risk is 10 percent two days after mini-stroke symptoms appear and between 8 percent and 20 percent for the 30- to 90-day period after symptom onset. But in the new study, Amarenco and his colleagues found stroke risks of 1.5 percent at two days, 2.1 percent at seven days and 3.7 percent at 90 days when mini-strokes were treated aggressively. One year after symptoms, the stroke rate was 5.1 percent. ""Although this was not a randomized trial and there was no comparison group to assess whether specialized units performed better than nonspecialized (stroke) units, these (newly-reported) risks are substantially lower than expected. Outcomes in this study were at least 50 percent lower than those reported in previous studies,"" Sacco and Rundek write. ""The rate was remarkably lower,"" Arnett told Reuters Health. The study was also noteworthy because, over the long haul, patients did a particularly good job of taking the medications they were given. The researchers also found that the one-year stroke risk doubled when multiple blood vessel clogs were seen with brain imaging, a large artery was narrowed by heart disease and the patient scored a 6 or 7 on a seven-point scale that assesses stroke risk factors. More than two thirds of the patients in the study had a score of 4 or higher but the researchers caution that ""limiting urgent assessment to patients with a score of 4 or more would miss approximately 20 percent of those with early recurrent strokes.""

"Robison, 58, is autistic. At age 40, the Amherst resident was diagnosed with Asperger's syndrome, a developmental disorder marked by impaired social skills and difficulty with nonverbal communication. Although highly competent in fields like electronics, sound design, and car mechanics, Robison found his limited ability to read body language and other unspoken cues left him feeling cut off from normal human interaction. For the first time in many years, John Elder Robison entered a sixth-floor lab at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and settled into a chair. He was there to demonstrate — although not actually repeat — a procedure known as transcranial magnetic stimulation, or TMS, in which electromagnetic impulses are fired into carefully targeted areas of a patient's brain. TMS activates neurological pathways and is most commonly used to treat depression. Advertisement Beginning in 2008, Robison voluntarily underwent roughly a dozen TMS sessions as part of a research study conducted at BIDMC's Berenson-Allen Center for Noninvasive Brain Stimulation. The results are chronicled in Robison's new book, ""Switched On: A Memoir of Brain Change and Emotional Awakening."" In a moving, often harrowing narrative reminiscent of ""Awakenings"" and other popular works by the late neurologist and writer Oliver Sacks, Robison writes of the transformations these sessions helped unlock, the welcome ones — and the not so welcome. After his initial TMS session, Robison experienced music on a visceral level he had once known, long ago, but sensed he had lost. He burst into tears. ""The experience was richer and deeper, with an added layer of feeling,"" he writes. ""Perhaps I was hearing music pure and true, without the distorting lens of autism."" Other striking changes in perception and mood soon followed. Some proved transitory, others seemingly more permanent. ""The change in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,"" he said during an interview in a hospital conference room. Advertisement His book is likely to spark even greater interest — and funding — in TMS as a non-medicinal way to treat symptoms associated with disabilities like autism, epilepsy, ADHD, and dementia. Robison certainly hopes so. ""My world is strikingly different, even if the TMS energy is all dissipated,"" he said. He maintains his ability to read body language and communicate his own feelings through facial expression have improved dramatically. ""I feel I hear music with more clarity, too. Whether I think it's there, or it really is there, it's all the same,"" added Robison, a physically large man who smiles easily and often. To a reporter who first met him a decade ago, the changes in his demeanor are obvious: more relaxed, less guarded, more emotionally engaged. Robison also happens to be a gifted writer — his 2007 memoir ""Look Me in the Eye: My Life With Asperger's"" was a critically acclaimed bestseller. He's also a prolific blogger with a knack for dredging wry humor out of awkward situations. Still, for all the positive changes described in ""Switched On,"" Robison's fourth book, there were negatives he was forced to deal with. TMS treatments chipped away at what he calls his ""protective shield"" of autism, he writes, leaving him disoriented and depressed at times. His second marriage, to a woman who herself suffered from chronic depression, came undone within a year of his initial TMS sessions. He frequently fell behind schedule at work (Robison runs a high-end car repair business in Springfield and lives in Amherst). Old friendships fell apart. As Robison's public profile rose — since ""Look Me in the Eye,"" he has divided his time between the car business and advocating on behalf of autism awareness — it disrupted his life on many levels. Advertisement Robison, with research fellow Ali Jannati. Keith Bedford/Globe Staff At his lowest point, in 2009, Robison considered killing himself. Gaining and then losing abilities he'd never possessed caused ""a mixture of sadness and wonder,"" Robison writes, summing up his condition in one word: ""jarred."" Robison has previously written about growing up in Western Massachusetts in an intellectually prominent family (his father taught philosophy, his mother wrote poetry) plagued by alcoholism and mental illness. Much of that dysfunction was also chronicled in ""Running With Scissors,"" the 2002 best-selling memoir by Robison's brother, Augusten Burroughs. ""Switched On"" revisits that dark and stormy past. Yet it is more than a linear account of a life transformed by cutting-edge medical technology. A ""techno geek"" with a deep knowledge of mechanical and electrical systems — he once worked as a sound engineer and special-effects designer for the rock band KISS — Robison delves into the latest brain-research findings and TMS's potential to help others like himself. He celebrates neurodiversity more generally, too, a subject he has been teaching at William & Mary College and Harvard Medical School. During the interview, Robison addressed the concerns and hopes he took into his TMS sessions, and the impact they've had on his life since then. People close to him questioned whether the risk was worth it. Or even if an ""improved"" version of himself would be someone they could love as much. Advertisement ""Some thought I was crazy to let them do that to my brain, but I never had that fear,"" said Robison. ""The technology was thoroughly familiar to me. And even though I knew these kinds of things could be dangerous if used wrong, I had confidence that a Harvard teaching hospital would use them safely."" Weighing the risk-reward balance, he continued, ""I wondered, what if [the sessions] could really turn me on to being sensitive to other people? I'd concluded that one reason I was kind of down was, I could not receive all these messages of love and kindness coming my way. People would ask, ‘Can't you tell how happy you made us?' Well, no, I'd say. I can't."" Even a 1 percent chance at success seemed worth the odds, Robison went on. And even if, as he'd been warned, any changes in brain function might last only half as long as the 30-minute treatments themselves. The negatives? These, too, he has come to accept. ""I was probably naive at the outset,"" he admitted. ""I had this idea that if I could only ‘get' these happy messages, I would be happier. It didn't occur to me that most of the news out there, most of the emotion, is, if not bad, at least not all good. Not sweetness and light but a world of angst and avarice and greed. It was overpowering."" Advertisement Robison's TMS research team was led by Harvard neurologist Dr. Alvaro Pascual-Leone, who supplies an introduction to ""Switched On."" In a separate interview, Pascual-Leone says Robison's book demonstrates how small changes in brain function, however temporary, can have a life-changing impact. Imagine, Pascual-Leone says, someone who cannot see color being told the sky is blue — an abstract, meaningless concept. Suddenly, for a brief period, he's able to see the sky in color. Forever after, the idea of ""blue"" will no longer be meaningless. ""Now translate that concept to emotions,"" he continues. ""If you can give [someone like Robison] an idea of what emotions may be hidden behind a voice or face, then it enables his brain, without TMS, to change the way he approaches life and people."" Nevertheless, Pascual-Leone acknowledges that these changes can be challenging as well as beneficial, as Robison describes. A recent paper by the BIDMC team concluded that TMS, while appealing and worth further study, is not yet recommended as an autism treatment. Rather, it may be best used to alleviate certain symptoms associated with spectrum disorder, including depression. Still, there are a number of clinics currently offering TMS as an autism treatment, a practice that concerns many researchers. ""People are desperate to help their loved ones, which I understand,"" Pascual-Leone says. ""Will it get more attention because of John's book? Absolutely. But his book does illustrate that the consequences can be long-lasting, and detrimental."" Robison remains optimistic that as research continues, the potential benefits will outweigh the risks. ""I owe a great debt [to the Harvard team] for helping me see I was not broken or defective,"" he said. ""That this painful disability of mine was a rare gift."" ""People are scared of the science-fiction aspect to this, but it's real,"" he added. ""And what I wrote about in the book isn't 10 percent of what they're doing now."" ""Switched On"" ends in 2013. Robison, now happily remarried, says he's become even more militant advocating on behalf of what he calls ""my tribe."" ""You can look at my success in the world,"" he said, ""and it's not just in my mind. It's undeniable."" ""The change [after the therapy] in my ability to relate to people is really, really big,"" Robison said. Keith Bedford/Globe Staff/Globe Staff Joseph P.

"(Reuters) - A stem cell therapy developed by Vericel Corp helped reduce deaths and hospitalizations in advanced heart failure patients, according to data from a midstage study, potentially providing a treatment that could delay the need for heart transplants. However, the treatment failed to improve secondary goals of the trial, such as heart-pumping efficiency and six-minute walking distance, and Vericel shares fell more than 31 percent by afternoon trading on Monday. ""It's a little baffling that you're keeping patients alive, but not having any effect on those secondary endpoints,"" said Needham & Co analyst Chad Messer. ""People were looking for downside and they had one."" The data compared Vericel's bone marrow-derived ixmyelocel-T stem cells with placebo in 109 well-treated patients with advanced heart failure who had exhausted medical and device therapies. After one year, the Vericel treatment led to a 37 percent reduction versus placebo in a composite of adverse events, including death, heart-related hospitalizations and unplanned clinic visits related to heart failure. Vericel last month reported that the study succeeded. Detailed results were unveiled on Monday at an American College of Cardiology meeting in Chicago and in the Lancet medical journal. The result was primarily driven by the difference in deaths of 13.7 percent in the placebo group, or 7 deaths, compared with 3.4 percent, or 2 deaths, for the ixmyelocel-T group. In addition, 38 percent of stem cell patients required hospitalization, versus 47 percent for placebo. ""This is strong evidence in a well-designed trial that we can decrease events,"" said Dr. Timothy Henry, the study's lead investigator and chief of cardiology at Cedars Sinai Heart Institute in Los Angeles. ""For patients, this is a really hopeful thing."" Henry, who presented the data at the ACC meeting, stressed the need for larger trials to prove the benefit of ixmyelocel-T For the treatment, bone marrow is taken from the patient and enhanced over two weeks to increase two types of cells associated with healing. They are then injected directly into the patient's heart. With advanced heart failure, a leading cause of hospitalizations, blood-pumping ability is diminished as the heart's left ventricle becomes enlarged and weakened. If the disease worsens despite all available medicinal and interventional therapies, the only options are heart transplant or a pumping assist device. ""The idea is to find a treatment for this group of people before they get to that stage,"" Henry said. Vericel shares were down $2.01, or 33 percent, at $4.02 on Nasdaq.",0,story_reviews_00462
"While breathing fresh, clean air can boost productivity, sleep and overall health, not everyone can live in the great outdoors and it's difficult to know just how clean the indoor air in your home or office is. Since most people spend about 90 percent of their time inside, having poor indoor air quality could affect your health and the health of your family members—especially during winter. ""Low dry humidity in the winter can make asthma worse and children who have dried mucosa can acquire some nasal infections easier,"" Dr. Robert G. Lahita, chairman of medicine at Newark Beth Israel Medical Center in New Jersey, told FoxNews.com. ""Heating ducts that have mold and spores in them can make respiratory symptoms worse in the winter when hot air is blowing through them. Dry air can also exacerbate some illnesses and can be a problem as well."" Different sources of air pollution in your home could include paints that release lead or volatile organic compounds (VOCs), carpets that harbor dirt, dust mites, and fungus and even nitrogen dioxide from gas stoves, but these aren't the worst culprits, Lahita said. ""In the winter the biggest issue is carbon monoxide poisoning, with emergency medical services we see a few of these every year-- it is from faulty heaters, cooking without ventilation or fireplaces,"" he said. Every room in your house could be susceptive to some form of an air pollutant, but now there is a new device and app that says it can help you breathe easier by tracking air quality. Awair is the first smart air quality device that monitors, analyzes and provides feedback to improve the air you breathe. The device collects data such as indoor temperature, humidity, carbon dioxide, fine dust particles and VOCs. It analyzes the data in real-time and gives an Awair score on a 0 to 100 color-coded scale, 0 being the worst air quality. ""The goal for the user is to keep five green dots. As soon as you see other colored (amber and red) dots show up on top of the green dots, your environment is getting off the healthy ranges whether it being temperature, humidity, CO2, VOCs, and dust,"" Ronald Ro, the CEO and co-founder of Bitfinder Inc., the makers of Awair, told FoxNews.com. Based on your air score, the monitoring gadget will send personalized alerts and advice to the user via its corresponding Awair mobile app. When air conditions are harmful, like when a bedroom has a high carbon dioxide level, it will send a notification to the user and advise them to open up a window through the app. The app also provides Mayo Clinic ""message cards"" that give relevant information and recommendations for ways to keep your indoor environment healthy. If you already have a smart device system for your home, Awair is working on partnerships with several connected devices like Nest thermostat and other smart appliances so you can manage the air quality in your home or office when you're not there. The Awair app is free to download, but each device costs $199 dollars. For more information go to GetAwair.com.",0,story_reviews_00473
"Two blood-building drugs injected soon after birth may give tiny preemies a lasting long-term edge, boosting brain development and IQ by age 4, a first-of-its-kind study found. The study was small but the implications are big if larger, longer studies prove the drugs help even the playing field for these at-risk children, the researchers and other experts say. Babies who got the medicine scored much better by age 4 on measures of intelligence, language and memory than preemies who didn't get it. The medicine group's scores on an important behavior measure were just as good as a control group of 4-year-olds born on time at a normal weight. The results are ""super exciting,"" said Dr. Robin Ohls, the lead author and a pediatrics professor at the University of New Mexico. She said it's the first evidence of long-term benefits of the drugs when compared to no blood-boosting treatment. Even though the treated youngsters didn't do as well as the normal-weight group on most measures, their scores were impressive and suggest greater brain development than the other preemies, Ohls said. They scored about 12 points higher on average on IQ tests than the untreated kids but about 10 points lower than the normal-weight group. On tests measuring memory and impulsive behavior, the treated kids fared as well as those born at normal weight. Here's how those differences would show up in a preschool setting: The untreated group would be the kids who struggle a little in class, while the those who got the medicines would do OK but not as well as those born at a normal weight, said Dr. Michael Schreiber, a prematurity expert at the University of Chicago's Comer Children's Hospital. Survival of extremely tiny preemies has improved dramatically in the past 50 years, but treatment for medical problems and developmental delays linked with prematurity has not kept pace, Schreiber said. He was not involved in the study. He said larger studies including more diverse patient populations are needed to determine if the drugs can help a broader range of preemies. The study involved 53 children, most white or Hispanic, born more than a month premature and weighing less than 3 pounds at hospitals in New Mexico, Utah and Colorado. Two dozen normal-weight children were also included. Results were published Monday in Pediatrics. Shortly after birth the preemies were randomly assigned to receive injections of either erythropoeitin (EPO), three times weekly; darbepoetin once a week for several weeks; or no treatment. The drugs build red blood cells and are approved to treat anemia caused by cancer treatment or resulting from other conditions. Preemies lack the ability to make new red blood cells and often need frequent blood transfusions to replace blood taken for lab tests. The drugs are now sometimes used to try to reduce their need for transfusions, in doses similar to the ones studied. The drugs can increase endurance by boosting oxygen levels in the blood, and have been implicated in some sports doping scandals. Dr. Sandra Juul, a University of Washington pediatrics professor, is leading a larger multi-center study of both drugs in preemies and said it's too soon to recommend the medicines for treating developmental delays. Still, since almost half of infants born extremely early have significant developmental problems, any treatment that could improve their lives ""is incredibly important,"" Juul said. ——— Pediatrics: http://www.pediatrics.org Prematurity: http://tinyurl.com/pc8chdd ——— Follow AP Medical Writer Lindsey Tanner at http://www.twitter.com/LindseyTanner .

"Photo The first germs to colonize a newborn delivered vaginally come almost exclusively from its mother. But the first to reach an infant born by cesarean section come mostly from the environment — particularly bacteria from inaccessible or less-scrubbed areas like lamps and walls, and skin cells from everyone else in the delivery room. Photo That difference, some experts believe, could influence a child's lifelong health. Now, in the first study of its kind, researchers on Monday confirmed that a mother's beneficial microbes can be transferred, at least partially, from her vagina to her baby after a C-section. The small proof-of-principle study suggests a new way to inoculate babies, said Dr. Maria Gloria Dominguez-Bello, an associate professor of medicine at New York University and lead author of the report, published on Monday in Nature Medicine. ""The study is extremely important,"" said Dr. Jack Gilbert, a microbial ecologist at Argonne National Laboratory who did not take part in the work. ""Just understanding that it's possible is exciting."" But it will take further studies following C-section babies for many years to know to what degree, if any, the method protects them from immune and metabolic problems, he said. Some epidemiological studies have suggested that C-section babies may have an elevated risk for developing immune and metabolic disorders, including Type 1 diabetes, allergies, asthma and obesity. Scientists have theorized that these children may be missing key bacteria known to play a large role in shaping the immune system from the moment of birth onward. To replace these microbes, some parents have turned to a novel procedure called vaginal microbial transfer. A mother's vaginal fluids — loaded with one such essential bacterium, lactobacillus, that helps digest human milk — are collected before surgery and swabbed all over the infant a minute or two after birth. An infant's first exposure to microbes may educate the early immune system to recognize friend from foe, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Friendly bacteria, like lactobacilli, are tolerated as being like oneself. Those from hospital ventilation vents or the like may be perceived as enemies and be attacked. These early microbial interactions may help set up an immune system that recognizes ""self"" from ""non-self"" for the rest of a person's life, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. In the United States, about one in three babies are delivered by C-section, a rate that has risen dramatically in recent decades. Some hospitals perform the surgery on nearly seven in ten women delivering babies. An ideal C-section rate for low-risk births should be no more than 15 percent, according to the World Health Organization. Dr. Dominguez-Bello's study involved 18 babies born at the University of Puerto Rico hospital in San Juan, where she recently worked. Seven were born vaginally and 11 by elective C-section. Of the latter, four were swabbed with the mother's vaginal microbes and seven were not. Microbes were collected on a folded sterile piece of gauze that was dipped in a saline solution and inserted into each mother's vagina for one hour before surgery. As the operations began, the gauze was pulled out and placed in a sterile collector. One to two minutes after the babies were delivered and put under a neonatal lamp, researchers swabbed each infant's lips, face, chest, arms, legs, back, genitals and anal region with the damp gauze. The procedure took 15 seconds. Dr. Dominguez-Bello and her colleagues then tracked the composition of microbes by taking more than 1,500 oral, skin and anal samples from the newborns, as well as vaginal samples from the mothers, over the first month after birth. For the first few days, ambient skin bacteria from the delivery room predominated in the mouths and on the skin of C-section babies who were not swabbed, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. But in terms of their bacterial colonies, the infants swabbed with the microbes closely resembled vaginally delivered babies, she found, especially in the first week of life. They were all covered with lactobacilli. Gut bacteria in both C-section groups, however, were less abundant than that found in the vaginally delivered babies. Anal samples from the swabbed group, oddly, contained the highest abundance of bacteria usually found in the mouth. The results show the complexity of labor, said Dr. Alexander Khoruts, a microbial expert and associate professor of medicine at the University of Minnesota. ""It cannot be simplified to a neat, effortless passage of the infant through the birth canal,"" he said. As the month progressed, the oral and skin microbes of all infants began to resemble normal adult patterns, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. But fecal bacteria did not, probably because of breast or formula feeding and the absence of solid foods. The transfer fell short of full vaginal birth-like colonization for two reasons, Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Compared to infants who spent time squeezed inside the birth canal, those who were swabbed got less exposure to their mother's microbes. And all infants delivered by C-section were exposed to antibiotics, which also may have reduced the number and variety of bacteria colonizing them. A larger study of vaginal microbial transfer is underway at N.Y.U., Dr. Dominguez-Bello said. Eighty-four mothers have participated so far. Infants delivered both by C-section and vaginally will be followed for one year to look for differences in the treated and untreated groups and to look for complications. Thus far the swabbing has proved entirely safe. The procedure is not yet recommended by professional medical societies, said Dr. Sara Brubaker, a specialist in maternal and fetal medicine at N.Y.U. Until more is known, physicians are hesitant to participate. ""But it has hit the lay press,"" she said. ""Patients come in and ask for it. They are doing it themselves."" Dr. Brubaker is one of them. When her daughter was born three and a half months ago, she arranged to have her baby swabbed.

"(Reuters Health) - Getting too little sleep during the week can increase some risk factors for diabetes, but sleeping late on weekends might help improve the picture, a small U.S. study suggests. Researchers conducted a sleep experiment with 19 healthy young men and found just four nights of sleep deprivation were linked to changes in their blood suggesting their bodies weren't handling sugar as well as usual. But then, when they let the men get extra sleep for the next two nights, their blood tests returned to normal, countering the effect of the short-term sleep deprivation. ""It gives us some hope that if there is no way to extend sleep during the week, people should try very hard to protect their sleep when they do get an opportunity to sleep in and sleep as much as possible to pay back the sleep debt,"" said lead study author Josaine Broussard of the University of Colorado Boulder. The study doesn't prove sleeping late every weekend can counter the ill effects of insufficient rest every other night of the week, Broussard cautioned. And it doesn't prove that catching up on sleep will prevent diabetes. ""We don't know if people can recover if the behavior is repeated every week,"" Broussard added by email. ""It is likely though that if any group of people suffer from sleep loss, getting extra sleep will be beneficial."" To assess the impact of sleep on diabetes risk, Broussard and colleagues focused on what's known as insulin sensitivity, or the body's ability to use the hormone insulin to regulate blood sugar. Impaired insulin sensitivity is one risk factor for type 2 diabetes, which is associated with age and obesity and happens when the body can't properly convert blood sugar into energy. The researchers did two brief sleep experiments. On one occasion, the volunteers were permitted just 4.5 hours of rest for four nights, followed by two evenings of extended sleep that amounted to 9.7 hours on average. On another occasion, the same men were allowed to sleep 8.5 hours for four nights. After the four nights of sleep deprivation, the volunteers' insulin sensitivity had fallen by 23 percent and their bodies had started to produce extra insulin. But when researchers checked again after two nights of extended rest, the men's insulin sensitivity, and the amount of insulin their bodies produced, had returned to normal, mirroring what was seen during the portion of the experiment when the volunteers consistently got a good nights' rest. The volunteers were given a calorie-controlled diet to limit the potential for their food and drink choices to influence the outcomes. In the real world, when people don't get enough sleep they tend to overeat, which may limit how much results from this lab experiment might happen in reality, the authors note in a report scheduled for publication in the journal Diabetes Care. ""The results from the present study are unlikely to be fully reflective of what may occur in persons who are older, overweight or obese, or have other potent risk factors for diabetes,"" said James Gangwisch, a researcher at Columbia University who wasn't involved in the study. Chronically sleep-deprived people are more likely to develop other health problems, though, ranging from obesity to high blood pressure to cognitive deficits, the study authors point out. ""By catching up on sleep on the weekends, people are reducing average extent and severity of the effects of sleep deprivation,"" Gangwisch added by email. ""Ideally, we would all get sufficient sleep on a nightly basis."" SOURCE: bit.ly/1DDtd9j Diabetes Care, released January 18, 2016.",0,story_reviews_00491
"It's often prescribed for migraines, rheumatoid arthritis, fever, gout and even post-operative pain. Now, diclofenac could be a contender to help treat cancer. The Repurposing Drugs in Oncology – ReDO – project published a clinical study this week in ecancermedicalscience that the affordable, generic non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug – or NSAID – has cancer-fighting properties. While researchers already suspected NSAIDs can help prevent cancer, they're only now beginning to explore the ways that they could actually help treat the disease. ""It's still somewhat surprising that there is still so much we don't understand about how many of the standard drugs we use every day, like diclofenac, work,"" study author Pan Pantziarka, member of the ReDO project and the Anticancer Fund, said in a press release. ""But the more we learn, the more we can see that these drugs are multi-targeted agents with interesting and useful effects on multiple pathways of interest in oncology."" Pantziarka and colleagues report that diclofenac may improve the immune system, the effectiveness of chemotherapy and radiation and the development of blood vessels. Previous studies have shown that the drug could reduce tumor size in fibrosarcoma, colorectal cancer, neuroblastoma, ovarian cancer and several other cancers, according to the press release. Treating cancer patients with diclofenac after surgery could also be beneficial, the authors wrote in the study. ""After all, it's ​metastatic disease that most often kills patients, not the original primary disease,"" Pantziarka said in the release.",0,story_reviews_00494
"Dr. Constance Lehman, a professor of radiology at Harvard Medical School and director of breast imaging at Massachusetts General Hospital, who is not on the task force, said she was pleased to see that although its advice had not changed, the group had placed more of an emphasis than before on the importance of women's having the freedom to decide how often to be screened and when to start. The guidelines state that from ages 40 to 74, screening will reduce the odds of dying from breast cancer, with women 40 to 49 benefiting the least and those 60 to 69 benefiting the most. The task force said it concluded ""with moderate certainty"" that the benefit was moderate in women 50 to 74 and small in women 40 to 49. For every 10,000 women screened repeatedly over 10 years, four lives are saved in women 40 to 49; eight in women 50 to 59; 21 in women 60 to 69; and 13 in women 70 to 74, the task force found. ""The science supports mammography as an important tool in the fight against breast cancer,"" said Dr. Michael LeFevre, a former chairman of the task force and a professor of medicine at the University of Missouri. He noted that breast cancer deaths have decreased since mammography came into widespread use in the 1980s, though some of the decline, he said, was also due to better treatments. ""We believe the benefits increase with age. But there are harms, and particularly in their 40s, women have to make a decision for themselves.""",0,story_reviews_00495
"Australian researchers found the greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced, the higher the hair cortisol concentrations This article is more than 3 years old This article is more than 3 years old Hair samples may help determine the risk of a child developing mental and other chronic illnesses later in their life, research led by the University of Melbourne has found. Researchers assessed the level of cortisol in the hair of 70 nine-year-old children from primary schools across Victoria. Cortisol is known as the ""stress hormone"" because it is released in response to acute stress to help the body react and cope. The greater number of traumatic events a child had experienced, such as divorce, injury, moving house, severe illness or the death of a family member, the higher the hair cortisol concentrations were, the researchers found. Parents – talk to your kids about mental health. Even if it's awkward | Hannah Jane Parkinson Read more It suggests hair cortisol levels may provide a marker of trauma exposure in children and identify those at risk of developing psychosocial and behavioural problems, and who may need medical and psychological support, leader of the study and a fellow in child and adolescent mental health at the University of Melbourne, Dr Julian Simmons, said. ""Childhood is an imperative and sensitive period of development, and when things go wrong it can have lifelong consequences, not just on mental health, but also on general health,"" Simmons said. ""What's less commonly understood is that beyond poor mental health, it can also be associated with the development of other illnesses such as diabetes, obesity and cholesterol issues, because cortisol is also central to glucose availability, blood pressure and immune function, so identifying these children is important."" While blood or saliva tests could be used to detect cortisol levels, these methods were sometimes problematic, especially in children, Simmons said. Cortisol levels fluctuate during the day meaning results were not always accurate, and only revealed cortisol levels at a single point in time. The tests could also be unpleasant and invasive for children, given blood tests require a needle and saliva tests require the child to fast beforehand. ""However, hair samples are not only easier to obtain, but provide us with a picture of total cortisol throughout the system across many months rather than just at a point in time,"" Simmons said. ""Looking at hair tells us new things."" The research is part of the ongoing Murdoch Childrens Research Institute's Childhood to Adolescence Study following a cohort of 1,200 children in and around Melbourne and was published in the journal, Psychoneuroendocrinology. Simmons said the results did not mean all children with elevated cortisol levels would go on to develop behavioural problems or mental illness, with many other social, environmental and genetic factors also involved. But it did reveal it was important to further study hormones and the body's endocrine system, and how they relate to mental illnesses like anxiety and depression, he said. ""We hope this can be used as one of the tools to identify children at risk,"" he said.",0,story_reviews_00497
"Photo For years, research has shown that babies born by cesarean section are more likely to develop health problems. Now, a groundbreaking study suggests that not all C-sections are equally risky. The research looked at all full-term, firstborn births in Scotland over a 15-year period and tracked the babies' long-term health. It is one of the largest and longest studies to explore how planned C-sections differ from other deliveries. Surprisingly, the data showed more health problems among babies born by planned C-section than among those delivered by emergency C-section or vaginal birth, even though the planned surgery is done under more controlled conditions. The finding suggests that the arduous experience of labor — that exhausting, sweaty, utterly unpredictable yet often strangely exhilarating process — may give children a healthy start, even when it's interrupted by a surgical birth. The new findings, published in JAMA this month, are important because the number of babies born by C-section has increased tremendously. In the United States, nearly one in three babies are born by C-section. Cesarean births that had no medical indication increased, to 5.5 percent of low-risk women in 2001, up from 3.3 percent of such women in 1991. Dr. Mairead Black, the University of Aberdeen obstetrician who led the study, said that as cesarean births had increased in Scotland and worldwide, the researchers wondered what, if anything, children born by C-section ""are missing out on."" ""Our thinking was: If a baby is born naturally, it comes into contact with bacteria from the mother, which might help with immune system development,"" Dr. Black said. Even attempted labor may provide some exposure to bacteria, she said. But babies delivered by a planned C-section, which is usually scheduled to take place well before the first pang of labor, may miss out entirely. ""When you don't wait for labor to begin on its own, you cut short all kinds of physiological changes and preparations for birth that are taking place toward the end of pregnancy,"" said Carol Sakala, the director of the nonprofit Childbirth Connection programs at the National Partnership for Women & Families. ""What is the effect of cutting off those processes so casually on such a large scale?"" Studies have consistently found that children born by C-section are at higher risk for health problems like obesity and allergies. C-section birth has also been associated with a higher risk for Type 1 diabetes. The Scottish study took advantage of the small country's rich trove of linked birth and medical databases to track the long-term health of 321,287 babies. Nearly 4 percent were born by planned C-section and 17 percent were delivered by emergency surgery. The remaining 252,917 were vaginal births. The researchers compared a range of health outcomes among the babies, including asthma, irritable bowel syndrome, obesity, Type 1 diabetes, early death and cancer. Over all, the differences between a scheduled C-section and an emergency C-section were slight. However, the data do begin to shed light on why babies born through vaginal birth may have fewer health risks than babies born by C-section. The biggest difference between babies born by scheduled and unscheduled C-section appeared in risk for Type 1 diabetes. The results showed that babies born by planned C-section had a 35 percent higher risk of Type 1 diabetes compared with babies born by emergency C-section, after adjusting for differences among the mothers. All of the babies born by C-section were slightly more likely to use an asthma inhaler at age 5: 10.3 percent of planned C-section babies and 10.19 percent of unscheduled C-section babies wound up using an inhaler, compared with 9.6 percent of vaginally born babies. Asthma hospitalization rates were also higher for babies born by planned C-section with a statistically significant increase of 22 percent over vaginally born babies. Although all of the C-section babies were more likely to be obese at age 5, the differences were not statistically significant after adjusting for differences among the mothers. There were no significant differences in cancer and irritable bowel disease among any of the types of births. No one knows exactly why labor may be protective, but the spontaneous onset of labor prompts fluid to clear from a baby's lungs, said Dr. Aaron Caughey, who helped draw up 2014 guidelines for the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists that urged providers to let women spend more time in labor and avoid an unnecessary C-section. The step is just one of a cascade of physiological changes that take place in mother and baby during the labor process, including surges in stress hormones and reproductive hormones like oxytocin that may help the fetus adapt during labor, preserve blood flow to the organs, and keep the baby alert and prepared for breast-feeding. During labor, a newborn absorbs maternal microbes into its mouth and gastrointestinal tract, said Dr. Josef Neu, a neonatologist at the University of Florida who has written about C-section babies and the hygiene hypothesis. The theory is that maternal microbes ""train"" the infant's immune system, so it doesn't overreact or become destructive and precipitate autoimmune disorders like Type 1 diabetes. ""It's an education process that says, ‘Calm down, you're going to be seeing this antigen again, you don't have to be so aggressive,'"" Dr. Neu said. Dr. Neu said the broad-spectrum antibiotics prescribed to the mother before a surgical delivery were another concern; the antibiotics can be transmitted to the baby through breast milk if not before birth, decreasing the diversity of natural bacteria. The findings are a reminder that although C-sections are appropriate in some circumstances, they are a poor substitute for labor. Childbirth and labor are ""a physiological process that we've evolved to over millions of years,"" Dr. Caughey said. ""It's been really well-designed by evolution."" Related:",0,story_reviews_00504
"But the study raises an intriguing question about that approach. It shows that women who had surgery survived longer than those who didn't: a median of 28 months vs. 19 months. When the researchers examined a small subset of the group — those who survived 10 years — they found that 9.6 percent had chosen to have surgery while 2.9 percent had not. ""Maybe we need to revisit this question of surgery,"" said Mary C. Schroeder, an assistant professor in the College of Pharmacy at the University of Iowa and one of the authors of the study. ""It may not be right for all women, but it may be better for some women than it was in 1995."" AD AD Previous research has reached the same conclusion, but a significant problem with this study and others like it is that they rely on retrospective data, looking back over any number of years, said Michael S. Sabel, the chief of surgical oncology at the University of Michigan, who was not involved in the newly published study. In retrospective research, it's impossible to filter out the countless reasons that a woman and her doctor might have made the decision to treat the cancer with or without surgery, leaving the conclusions unreliable for clinical decision-making, he said. ""It's premature to suggest, and it's a difficult conversation to have with patients, that removing the breast will help them live longer in the face of Stage 4 disease,"" Sabel said. Two small prospective studies have suggested no survival difference among women with Stage 4 breast cancer who have surgery and those who don't, he said. A large, randomized, prospective study currently being conducted by the Eastern Clinical Oncology Group should produce the most reliable data on the subject to date, he said. AD AD In a Stage 4 case, cancer cells have left the breast, metastizing to bones or other organs, which presents a more dire and immediate threat to a woman's survival than the presence of the original tumor. Still there may be reasons to remove the cancer in the breast. Some evidence suggests that it may be influencing the woman's immunological response to her cancer. Or it could be continuously ""seeding"" the spread of cancer to other parts of the body. In their study, Schroeder; Alexandra Thomas, a professor at Iowa's Carver College of Medicine, and others looked at 21,372 women from 1988 to 2011 who had Stage 4 breast cancer at the time of their original diagnosis and did not receive radiation as part of their first course of therapy. Their median age was 63. The researchers found that median survival for all of the women improved from 20 to 26 months as more sophisticated treatments and better imaging techniques developed over that time. As other research has shown, African American women were over-represented among women who have Stage 4 breast cancer at the time they are first diagnosed. AD AD In interviews, Schroeder and Thomas stressed that each decision about whether to have surgery is based on many factors that only a woman and her doctors can assess, in particular how far the cancer has spread and how sick she is. But with better therapies to control the cancer systemically and improved imaging that finds ever-smaller deposits of cancer in other parts of the body, it may be time to see whether surgery also can help increase the length of survival times, they said. ""Aggressive local therapy may benefit select women, such as those with an already established potential for durable remission,"" they wrote in their paper. That would include younger women whose cancers have not spread in great volume to other organs and who have certain kinds of cancers that respond better to drugs, Lisa Newman, medical director of the Henry Ford Health System's International Center for the Study of Breast Cancer Subtypes, said in an e-mail. Newman was not involved in the study. AD AD ""Theoretically...patients with metastatic breast cancer might benefit from surgery to remove the cancerous breast tumor in combination with medical therapies as a more complete reduction of their total body cancer burden,"" she added.

"Light therapy is cheap, easy to use and comes with few side effects compared to medication such as antidepressants, said lead author Raymond Lam, a professor of psychiatry at the University of British Columbia. AD Previous research on light therapy for non-seasonal depression has been limited. This study ""shows a new, proven-safe treatment of depression that is probably both more effective and less expensive than drug treatment or anything else,"" said Dan Kripke, a psychiatrist and professor emeritus at the University of California, San Diego, who has studied the topic but was not involved in the latest trial. AD The researchers said enough clinical evidence now supports mental health professionals recommending light therapy as a treatment for depression. Most people typically receive medication and psychotherapy — but medications don't work in all cases and there's a shortage of providers in many areas. AD Lam and his colleagues followed 122 patients and evaluated whether light therapy improved their mood when it was used both with and without fluoxetine, or Prozac, a commonly prescribed antidepressant. Over eight weeks, participants were exposed daily to 30 minutes from a fluorescent light box soon after waking up. Some participants were instead given placebo pills and placebo devices. AD Although the light therapy helped many patients, it provided the most benefit to those who were also taking the antidepressant. About 60 percent of those using light therapy with the antidepressant reported feeling almost back to normal, Lam said. AD Researchers have two main theories on why light therapy works. One is that it affects the biological clock in the brain. There's some evidence that depression, like jet lag, occurs when the biological clock is out of sync, and light helps to correct that, Lam said. Light is also believed to affect neurotransmitters in the brain. Those are considered important for the development of depression and are the targets of most antidepressant medications.

"With knee-replacement surgery on the rise, more patients with two bad knees are opting for a controversial procedure that replaces both at the same time. Simultaneous bilateral knee replacement, as the surgery is known, is a subject of debate among orthopedic surgeons, with conflicting evidence about the risks and benefits. Proponents say it eliminates the need for a second hospital stay and grueling rehabilitation period, reduces time spent under anesthesia and costs less. Some studies have found no difference in complication rates after bilateral surgery compared with unilateral surgery. A 2013 study in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery estimated the cost of bilateral surgery at $43,401 compared with $72,233 for two separate surgeries staged over time. The study concluded that bilateral surgery is more cost-effective with better outcomes for the average patient than staged procedures for two knees. But more recent studies have found increased rates of complication such as blood clots that travel to the lung, an increased need for blood transfusions, and a higher risk of death with the bilateral procedure. The rate of knee replacements in the U.S. almost doubled from 2000 through 2010, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and now exceeds 700,000 procedures a year. The CDC doesn't break out data, but studies indicate the percentage of patients who had both knees replaced at the same time has risen from less than 4% in 1999 to more than 6% at present. Ken McLaughlin, 63, had bilateral knee replacement surgery in October 2014; he spent three nights in the hospital, about a week in a rehabilitation clinic and took a three-month leave from work. He experienced pain but no complications. Photo: Ken McLaughlin Simultaneous bilateral procedures can be performed either by two surgeons operating in tandem or by a single surgeon who completes one knee and immediately turns to the other. Although the average age has dropped for patients getting knee surgery, many also have health issues that can increase the risk of complications. In 2013, a consensus group of experts recommended that surgeons use more restrictive criteria to select patients for double knee replacements and exclude those with high cardiac risks. The majority said patients who aren't candidates for simultaneous procedures should get a second one no sooner than three months after the first. ""We've learned a lot from years of data on who has complication issues,"" says Steven Haas, an orthopedic surgeon at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York. The hospital avoids bilateral knee surgery in patients who have any type of heart disease, as well as those with a body mass index of 40 or more. Obese patients often have conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure than can complicate surgery. Typically, Dr. Haas says, he doesn't perform bilateral surgery in patients over 80, and prefers not to do it in those over 75 unless they are in exceptional health. For healthy patients in their 50s and 60s, ""it's an elective decision,"" Dr. Haas says. Sandra Lynch, a 62-year-old wedding officiant in Frederick, Md., had trouble with her knees for more than a decade before getting bilateral knee replacement surgery in December 2014. She says she has no regrets. Photo: Sandra Lynch Nicholas Grosso, president of the Centers for Advanced Orthopaedics in Bethesda, Md., performs bilateral surgery in tandem with another surgeon. A typical hospital stay is three days, compared with two days for single-knee surgery. New anesthetic techniques help control pain after surgery, and as many as 40% of his bilateral patients go directly home. Others go to a rehabilitation facility for about a week, which isn't usually necessary for unilateral patients. Dr. Grosso says overall recovery time is typically the same, with full recovery in about four months. Ken McLaughlin, 63, had a bilateral knee replacement surgery in October 2014, with Dr. Grosso and a colleague, M. Brian Polsky. Mr. McLaughlin, who was an avid basketball player and volleyball coach, now teaches physical education to developmentally disabled children. Despite several surgeries over the years to repair damage, he had constant pain in both knees. Yet he wanted to put replacement off, he says, ""until I couldn't stand it anymore."" After consulting with Dr. Grosso, he decided on bilateral surgery. First, he spent several months getting ready by building up strength in his legs and hamstrings. Mr. McLaughlin, who lives in Laurel, Md., says it ""really hurt"" at first after surgery but he stopped taking pain medication after two days. After three nights in the hospital, he spent about a week in a rehabilitation clinic and took a leave from work until mid-January, working out twice a day for an hour and walking around his house. He had no complications and works out at the gym three times weekly. ""I'm feeling stronger and getting ready to snow ski this winter,"" he says. A study in May in the Journal of Arthroplasty compared cases matched for risks in simultaneous bilateral and unilateral knee surgeries in a database of nearly 44,000 patients. It found no significant difference in the rate of complications including infection, hospital re-admission, or death. But bilateral procedures were associated with increased overall complications and risk of subsequent surgery within 30 days. Study co-author David Manning, a joint replacement specialist at Northwestern Memorial Hospital in Chicago and associate professor at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine, says he recommends staged procedures over time for patients who need both knees replaced. He doesn't perform bilateral knee replacements. ""We decided it is not a safe practice, and it adds risk, so we don't do it,"" he says. Last year, a large study comparing the two types of surgery indicated that bilateral patients were at increased risk of both minor and major in-hospital complications as well as death. The study, published in the Journal of Bone and Joint Surgery, included hospital claims data on 24,574 simultaneous bilateral surgeries and 382,496 unilateral procedures. Surgeon Bryan Springer, a co-author of the study and fellowship director at OrthoCarolina Hip and Knee Center in Charlotte, N.C., says while complication rates are generally low for all knee surgeries, he is ""extremely selective"" about recommending bilateral surgery. ""If you pick your patient appropriately you can do this operation very safely,"" he says. Dr. Springer performs bilateral surgery with a team, starting the second knee while the first incision is being closed; if there are safety concerns after the first, he won't proceed with the second. Sandra Lynch, a 62-year-old wedding-officiant in Frederick, Md., had trouble with her knees for more than a decade. But with a busy schedule, she didn't want recovery to take more than four months. Before the procedure, she took a year to exercise, walking daily and building a desk over a disassembled recumbent bike. She had the bilateral knee replacement with Dr. Grosso and Dr. Polsky in December last year. Afterward, Ms. Lynch was hospitalized for four days. She needed a blood transfusion but was able to manage physical therapy before being transferred to a rehabilitation center for about a week. After bad reactions to narcotic pain medications and an anti-nausea patch, she switched to over-the-counter painkillers. Though she had to use a walker at first, after eight weeks she began to drive and walk without assistance. She is now back to work officiating at weddings and says she has no regrets.

"Photo Agitation and aggression are common in Alzheimer's patients, and there is no known safe and effective treatment. Now researchers report that a combination drug already in use for treating certain neurological problems may be a better remedy. Dextromethorphan is a cough suppressant commonly found in over-the-counter cough medicines, and quinidine is a drug used to control heart rhythm disorders. In combination, they are used to treat pseudobulbar affect, a neurological disorder involving involuntary crying or other emotional displays. The scientists randomized 152 Alzheimer's patients to a 10-week course of dextromethorphan-quinidine and 127 to placebo. Researchers then rated them using a well-validated scale that measures aggression and agitation. The study is in the Sept. 22 issue of JAMA. Aggression scores declined to 3.8 from 7.1 in the dextromethorphan-quinidine group and to 5.3 from 7.0 in those who took a placebo. Then the researchers re-randomized those who did not respond to placebo to receive either drugs or placebo, and found similar encouraging results for the drug combination.

"(Reuters) - Eli Lilly and Co's new Jardiance pill slashed deaths by 32 percent in patients with type 2 diabetes at risk of heart attack and stroke, a finding that could make it a mainstay diabetes treatment and triple its use, according to researchers and analysts. Lilly shares jumped as much as 9 percent after data from the trial was released Thursday at a medical meeting in Stockholm. ""This is the first diabetes therapy to show robust effect in reducing cardiovascular death. It really is big news,"" said Dr. Bernard Zinman, director of the Diabetes Centre at Mount Sinai Hospital in Toronto, who led the three-year study of 7,000 people. Because about one-half of the deaths in people with type 2 diabetes are caused by cardiovascular disease, reducing cardiovascular risk is considered essential to diabetes care. Type 2 diabetes is the most common form of the disease and is linked to obesity. Jardiance, a once-a-day pill which won U.S. approval last year, belongs to a new family of treatments called SGLT2 inhibitors that include Johnson & Johnson's Invokana and AstraZeneca Plc's Farxiga. They lower blood sugar by inhibiting reabsorption of glucose in the kidneys. Jardiance was developed jointly with Germany's privately held Boehringer Ingelheim. Zinman, in an interview, predicted the new study would prompt medical societies to recommend that Jardiance be used by type 2 diabetics who have a history of heart disease or who are at risk of cardiovascular events. About 26 million Americans have type 2 diabetes, according to federal data for 2014. The vast majority of those patients could be candidates for Jardiance, which costs over $4,000 per year, Morningstar analyst Damien Conover said. ""The big news here is that the drug reduced cardiovascular stuff. That has not been the case with all things in diabetes,"" said David Marrero, president of health care and education at the American Diabetes Association. ""It is probably going to be a more popular drug because of that."" JARDIANCE COULD BOOST EARNINGS Sanford Bernstein analyst Tim Anderson more than tripled his annual sales forecast for Jardiance and combination drugs containing it to $2.7 billion by 2020. He cut his 2020 sales forecast for Merck & Co Inc's Januvia, the leading member of a competing class of oral diabetes drugs called DPP-4 inhibitors, to $6 billion from $7.8 billion. Anderson estimates Jardiance could boost Lilly's earnings per share by 8 percent on average across 2016 to 2020. In the study, patients taking Jardiance had a 38 percent reduction in cardiovascular death, including from heart attacks and strokes. There was no significant difference in non-fatal heart attacks or non-fatal strokes. Those taking Jardiance had a 32 percent lower risk of dying from any cause, and a 35 percent lower rate of hospitalizations from heart failure. The benefits were especially impressive because they added to protection that patients received from taking cholesterol fighters and other life-saving heart drugs, Zinman said. ""This is a wonderful thing,"" said Dr. Jerome Tolbert of Mount Sinai Beth Israel Hospital in New York. He has not prescribed Jardiance and similar drugs as frequently as treatments like Januvia, but expects that may change based on the new data. Zinman noted that Jardiance, like other SGLT2 drugs, causes weight loss and reduced blood pressure, besides lowering both blood sugar levels and body fat, and also reduces swelling, which all help the cardiovascular system. Lilly and Boehringer last month disclosed that Jardiance met its primary study goal, becoming the first diabetes drug to show heart-protective results in a large cardiovascular trial. But they did not unveil detailed data until Thursday at the medical meeting. Shares of Lily closed up 6.5 percent at $89.98 on Thursday, after rising as high as $92.83. In calculating the combined number of cardiac deaths, non-fatal heart attacks and non-fatal strokes, 14 percent fewer events were seen in patients taking Jardiance in combination with standard treatments, compared with patients who took standard treatments alone, meeting the study's main goal. Standard treatments included statins, which lower cholesterol, and blood pressure drugs.",0,story_reviews_00544
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Pathway Genomics, a company known for pushing the boundaries of direct-to-consumer genetic testing, on Thursday will launch a cancer screening test designed to detect bits of cancer DNA in the blood of otherwise healthy people. The test represents a first in the rapidly developing field of ""liquid biopsies,"" which use gene sequencing technology to screen blood samples for trace amounts of DNA associated with different cancers. Several cancer diagnostic companies have been working on the tests, a field that has recently been joined by makers of DNA blood screening tests for fetal abnormalities after the tests detected early cancers in expectant mothers. Cowen & Co estimates that use of DNA blood tests for cancer screening will exceed $10 billion a year by the end of the decade. But the move by Pathway, a privately owned maker of genetic tests ranging from cancer risk and heart health to drug response, underscores a growing debate over how much genetic information should be made available to healthy people if it is not yet clear how it can improve their health. The company has already run into trouble on a similar issue. In 2010, Walgreens pulled Pathway's genetic testing kits from its pharmacies after U.S. health regulators warned patients might take action without understanding the results. Several oncology experts said liquid biopsy tests like Pathway's, while exciting, still require large clinical studies proving they help people beat cancer through early detection. Doctors will also need a clear assessment of their accuracy. ""For any given test, the rate of false positives causing unnecessary alarm and false negatives that provide false security should be known,"" said Dr. Keith Stewart, an oncologist who heads Mayo Clinic's Center for Individualized Medicine. Pathway's screening test looks at 96 genetic markers associated with major cancer types such as breast, ovarian, lung, colon and melanoma. The company is focusing on mutations that are relatively well-understood, and for which there are specific treatments, said Chief Executive Jim Plante. The cost to consumers begins at $299 to periodically check for DNA in their blood that could act as an early warning sign of cancer. The tests must be ordered by a doctor, based on a patient's risk profile. A positive test will require additional checks to find where the cancer is growing. Pathway also launched a blood test for patients already diagnosed with cancer to help determine whether a treatment is working, or whether the disease is likely to return. SCREENING VS MONITORING Scientists have long known that cancers shed bits of genetic material into the blood. Privately held Guardant Health and Personal Genome Diagnostics Inc already offer blood tests for cancer patients. Roche-backed Foundation Medicine Inc, Genomic Health Inc, Illumina Inc and Sequenom Inc say they have similar tests in the works. But cancer experts say there are major differences between using such tests to screen for cancer and monitoring patients who are already known to have it. For example, some early cancers may not secrete DNA fragments into the bloodstream and require other types of detection. A colonoscopy can find and remove polyps before they pose a threat as colon cancer. ""If we are relying on a test that can only detect cancer after it has formed, we miss a huge opportunity to intervene,"" said Dr. Scott Kopetz of the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center. Patients might be attracted to a less-invasive test for colon cancer, but if it is less effective, it might result in more cases of colon cancer, not fewer. Another concern is that the tests may pick up on markers that are never destined to be cancer, something already known to occur in blood tests for prostate cancer, Kopetz said. Pathway says its test is more than 99 percent accurate in detecting mutations in blood samples that contain at least nine copies of a tested mutation. ""We do expect to detect cancer DNA when the tumors are small - much sooner than stage three or four,"" Plante said. Dr. Bert Vogelstein, a cancer geneticist at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, said Pathway's figure represents the test's technical ability to detect DNA in the blood. Doctors, however, need an indication of how many patients will get a false positive result, something that can only be determined in a very large clinical trial, said Vogelstein. He is advising two companies developing liquid biopsy tests for cancer screening: Sysmex and Personal Genome Diagnostics. Plante said the company has started two clinical trials involving patients but has yet to publish any results on how the tests perform in people.",0,story_reviews_00550
"A common heart drug called a beta blocker was associated with a striking increase in survival for women with ovarian cancer in a study that suggests a possible new strategy for treating a variety of tumors. Researchers analyzing a database of 1,425 women with the tough-to-treat cancer found those who had taken a certain type of beta blocker lived more than four years longer on average than those who hadn't been prescribed the drug. The women were taking the medicine to treat high blood pressure or another heart problem, not as part of their cancer treatment. The study was retrospective, and thus wasn't randomized, and had other important limitations, researchers said. Further research, which is under way, is necessary to determine whether the findings could be translated into a new treatment for the disease. ""It's very interesting and very thought-provoking,"" said Christina M. Annunziata, clinical director of the women's malignancies branch of the Center for Cancer Research at the National Institutes of Health. ""I don't think it's practice-changing quite yet."" Dr. Annunziata, who wasn't involved in the study, co-authored an editorial accompanying the report, published in Cancer, a journal of the American Cancer Society. More than 21,000 women in the U.S. will be diagnosed with ovarian cancer this year, the cancer society estimates. More than 14,000 will die from it, making it the fifth most deadly cancer among women. Recurrence rates are high and there have been few advances made beyond standard chemotherapy in some 30 years. Extra Time 47.8 months: Median survival for women taking any beta blocker, a common heart drug, during chemotherapy for ovarian cancer Median survival for women taking any beta blocker, a common heart drug, during chemotherapy for ovarian cancer 42 months: Median survival for women not taking a beta blocker during chemotherapy Median survival for women not taking a beta blocker during chemotherapy 94.9 months: Median survival for women taking a nonselective (first generation) beta blocker during chemotherapy Median survival for women taking a nonselective (first generation) beta blocker during chemotherapy 38 months: Median survival for women taking a selective (second generation) beta blocker during chemotherapy Source: the journal Cancer Dr. Annunziata and the study authors cautioned that beta blockers have side effects and more research is needed to see if the drugs' benefits outweigh risks for cancer patients. In recent years, studies have shown that chronic stress promotes the growth and spread of ovarian and other cancers. One way is by stimulating so-called fight-or-flight hormones such as adrenaline and norepinephrine, said Anil Sood, professor of gynecologic oncology and cancer biology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston and senior author of the new report. Beta blockers can mitigate stress but previous studies that looked at their effect on ovarian cancer have been mixed. Beta blockers come in different versions. Mouse and test-tube studies have shown that so-called nonselective beta blockers inhibit molecular pathways that promote tumor growth. Selective versions, designed to minimize side effects for heart patients, are less effective in hitting such targets. Dr. Sood and his colleagues wondered if the same effect would be found in people. The 1,425 patients in the study were treated at four different institutions between 2000 and 2010; 268 had been treated with beta blockers, including 75 given a nonselective version, while they were on chemotherapy. The researchers found that median survival for those treated with any blocker was 47.8 months, compared with 42 months for those not taking the medicines. But difference between those taking a nonselective beta blocker—propranolol in essentially all cases—and those taking a selective version was much more dramatic: 94.9 months versus 38 months. ""We would have predicted that there would be some difference but we were surprised to see the magnitude of difference that was coming up here,"" Dr. Sood said. Still, it would ""require prospective studies to feel really good that there is a significant benefit,"" Dr. Sood said. The study didn't show what dose might be effective or how long patients were on the drugs, for instance, or what biological markers might help predict which patients would benefit. ""This is not something that people should rush out and start taking,"" Dr. Annunziata said. ""There are so many side effects of these drugs especially if you don't have high blood pressure."" For instance, people with a history of asthma would be at risk for serious side effects with a nonselective beta blocker. Since essentially all beta blockers, including propranolol, are generic, drug companies aren't likely to sponsor the large prospective study that would likely be necessary to determine any role beta blockers might have in cancer. Grants would be required, Dr. Sood said. But other research has suggested that stress may similarly affect colon, lung and prostate cancers.

"(Reuters Health) - When the results of a test wouldn't change how doctors manage a patient's care, most say it's not worth doing. But new tests for breast cancer risk mutations beyond the well-known BRCA genes would offer actionable information for many women and their doctors, a new study finds. The BRCA1 and BRCA2 gene mutations put women at high risk for breast, ovarian and other cancers, but mutations of other genes are believed to confer extra risk as well. Earlier this year, 17 genetic experts argued against testing for a wider panel of breast cancer-related gene mutations until they are proven to be valid and useful in clinical practice (see Reuters story of May 27, 2015 here: reut.rs/1TvOoDf). ""There's a lot of controversy even among experts,"" said the senior author of the new study, Dr. Leif W. Ellisen of Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston. For 15 years, at-risk women have only been tested for BRCA1 and 2, but many companies now offer multi-gene panels for 20, 25 or 30 other genes, Ellisen told Reuters Health. ""Are patients better off getting these much broader tests?"" he said. ""Does it actually change what you would tell them to do in terms of screening, prevention, or risk management?"" According to the new results, at least for some women, it would change their clinical management, he said. Several of the authors of the new paper disclosed that they receive research funding, consult for or are employed by genetic testing companies like Myriad Genetics and Invitae Corporation. Between 2001 and 2014, the study team did panel tests for 25 or 29 genes on 1,046 women who were referred for hereditary breast or ovarian cancer gene testing, but had tested negative for BRCA mutations. Most of the women had a personal history of breast or ovarian cancer already. The researchers found that 40 women, or 4 percent of the total group, did have potentially harmful mutations in other genes. Of those 40 women, 26 had mutations carrying low to moderate risk of breast or ovarian cancer, eight had mutations associated with Lynch syndrome, which increases colon and ovarian cancer risk, and three had high-risk breast cancer genes. Including another 23 patients who were referred into the study at a late stage, there were 63 women positive for non-BRCA mutations. Of those, the researchers decided that 33 would have been considered for additional screening or prevention measures based on their results. And for many, family testing would be recommended for first-degree relatives, according to the report in JAMA Oncology. Even among all appropriate candidates who are sent for genetic testing, only nine percent will test positive for the BRCA mutations, so an additional four percent who have non-BRCA mutations is a significant number, Ellisen said. Often these additional women do not have a high risk of breast or ovarian cancer, but some do have a high risk of colon or uterine cancer, and would be referred for additional screening, he said. Multigene testing is not more expensive than testing for the BRCA mutations alone, he said. Though these results indicate that additional genetic screening is clinically useful, some genetic test results will be uncertain, and it can be psychologically difficult for patients to deal with this uncertainty, Ellisen said. ""We do not advocate for broad population-based screening,"" he said. ""The interpretation of these tests is not a simple color-by-numbers thing."" The vast majority of uncertain genes will be benign, but a misinterpretation could lead a patient to a drastic, unnecessary surgical procedure, he said. ""Many cancer genetics experts have again urged caution, characterizing the use of multigene testing in the clinical setting as premature,"" Dr. Elizabeth M. Swisher of the University of Washington Medical Center in Seattle writes in a commentary accompanying the new paper. ""Yet thousands of women and their physicians are ignoring this advice, ordering a wide selection of multiplex tests daily,"" Swisher writes. ""The train has left the station and is unlikely to return,"" so it is important to assess how useful this additional testing can be, she concludes.

"En Español TUESDAY, Aug. 11, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- Colonoscopy can save lives, but experts agree that testing rates remain too low. Now, researchers say a special scoring system might point to those people at highest risk for colon cancer, who may need the test the most. The system might also make colon cancer screening more efficient and boost the number of people who get checked for the disease, said a team led by Dr. Thomas Imperiale of Indiana University Medical Center, in Indianapolis. One expert said more efforts are needed to get people to undergo colonoscopy, which is currently recommended once every 10 years beginning at age 50. ""Five percent of the U.S. population will be diagnosed with colon cancer within their lifetimes,"" said Dr. Arun Swaminath, director of the inflammatory bowel disease program at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. He was not involved in the new research. Swaminath noted that one study published in 2012 found that ""colonoscopy reduced the risk of death from colon cancer by 53 percent, by removing polyps. No other procedure is available to remove polyps from anywhere in the colon."" And while some areas of the United States have rates of compliance with colonoscopy guidelines of 75 percent or more, ""many areas have poor colon cancer screening rates,"" he added. Imperiale's team noted that not all people deemed to be at ""average risk"" for colon cancer face the same risk of the disease, and so some might benefit more from invasive colonoscopy than others. In the new study, the Indiana researchers looked at more than 4,400 Americans who were scheduled to undergo their first screening colonoscopy. They calculated a clinical ""score"" for each of these patients, based on their health information, and the five most common risk factors for colon cancer: age, sex, waist size, smoking and family history. Then they looked at the results of each patient's colonoscopy. The study found that patients classified under the scoring system as low-risk did, in fact, have far fewer advanced abnormal growths that might develop into cancer, compared to patients classified as high-risk. So, patients scoring at the lower end of risk for colon cancer might be able to have less invasive screening tests (such as the fecal occult blood test), while those at higher risk would require a colonoscopy, Imperiale's team concluded. However, Swaminath wasn't fully sold on the notion. He believes that the scoring system ""was only modestly able to separate people within the risk groups."" Swaminath pointed out that even the new study found that ""low- to intermediate-risk patients still have a risk between of between 1.9 percent to 9.9 percent of harboring a polyp that can develop into cancer."" For now, he said, the data from this study is not strong enough to spur any changes in current screening recommendations. Dr. Jules Garbus is co-chief of colon and rectal surgery at Winthrop-University Hospital in Mineola, N.Y. He seemed more supportive of the new scoring system. ""A risk stratification tool is critical in helping physicians make appropriate screening recommendations for patients,"" Garbus said. ""While high-risk patients may ultimately require a screening colonoscopy, many average- and low-risk patients could undergo less invasive screening procedures. This can improve patient compliance with screening, as well as address escalating health care cost issues. The study is published Aug. 10 in the Annals of Internal Medicine.

"Previous research on communication in couples affected by Alzheimer's has tended to focus on deficits, said study author Christine Williams, professor and director of the PhD in Nursing program at Florida Atlantic University's Christine E. Lynn College of Nursing. Identifying patterns that help couples maintain their bond could make it easier for caregiving spouses to find meaning and improve satisfaction with their marriage. As Alzheimer's disease progresses, cognitive impairment can take an ever greater toll on communication and relationships. A new study identifies patterns of communication that can help couples affected by Alzheimer's maintain a sense of connection, which could improve quality of life for both partners. Advertisement ""No one is looking at it from the perspective of what these couples are doing right, what is helping,"" said Williams, whose findings were published in the International Journal for Human Caring. ""Some past research has involved a caregiver giving directions and seeing if his or her spouse [with Alzheimer's] can follow. A relationship is obviously so much more than that."" Members of Williams's research team visited 15 couples in their home once a week for 10 weeks. The couples, who were recruited from a day program for people with memory disorders and their spouses, were receiving coaching in communication, with caregivers learning to listen, to avoid arguing, to not treat their spouse like a child. Twice during the 10 weeks, the couples were asked to discuss a topic of their choosing while the researcher left the room. A total of thirty 10-minute conversations were recorded. In analyzing the recordings, Williams identified 10 communication patterns that caregiving spouses used to connect with their partners and show affection. These patterns showed the caregivers applying what they'd learned through coaching in creative ways, she said. They included sharing news about friends or relatives or plans for the day as a way to involve their spouse in day-to-day events; waiting patiently and keeping eye contact while spouses searched for words; and finding alternate ways to communicate — for example, singing songs together when attempts to engage the spouse in certain topics failed. Advertisement The caregiving spouses seemed to value their partners' efforts to communicate as much as or more than the actual content of their conversations. They were willing to listen to stories they had heard before, and resisted correcting their partners' versions of past events. This showed that they ""value the relationship more than being right,"" Williams said. Some of the caregivers did voice frustration or tried to teach their partners information they had forgotten. Future research might focus on interventions that could help diffuse these frustrations, the paper noted. Yet Williams hopes that the more supportive and positive communication patterns that many of the caregivers showed will help nurses coach spouses and family members affected by Alzheimer's. Previous research has found that communication decline among people with dementia is a significant source of stress to caregivers, and most say they need education about communication. ""The reality is, a person with dementia isn't going to have a dramatic breakthrough and remember things forgotten,"" Williams said. ""At the same time, people with Alzheimer's do have moments of clarity or show affection when it's unexpected. These are moments that caregivers can cherish.""

"En Español By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, July 29, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- The U.S. Food and Drug Administration's approval of a temporary, implanted balloon device for weight loss may have many wondering how -- and how well -- it works. Called the ReShape Integrated Dual Balloon System, the device consists of two connected balloons filled with saline. The balloons take up space in the stomach, which presumably makes people feel fuller faster, the FDA said in its announcement Tuesday. But the device can only be used for six months at a time, and it is not likely to be an alternative for people who require lap-band surgery, stomach stapling or other forms of bariatric surgery, said Dr. Mitchell Roslin, chief of obesity surgery for Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""It's going to be effective for short-term weight-loss,"" Roslin said, ""but there is still an overwhelming question whether these devices provide any long-term benefit for obesity."" ""I don't think it's going to be part of the medical algorithm for treating obesity,"" he added. ""I think it's going to be for people who want to lose weight fairly rapidly."" In a clinical trial, the ReShape system helped people more than double their weight loss compared to those trying to lose weight through diet and exercise, an FDA news release said. That clinical trial was funded by the company that makes the ReShape system, according to a presentation from the Obesity Society annual meeting in Boston. The device is available to obese people who often don't qualify for surgical weight-loss procedures, according to the FDA. Obese people who have a body-mass index (a rough estimate of body fat based on your height and weight) between 30 and 40 and at least one obesity-related health condition are eligible for the new procedure, the agency said. Obesity-related health conditions include high blood pressure, type 2 diabetes and high cholesterol. It's also intended for those who have been unsuccessful in trying to lose weight through diet and exercise alone, the agency said. Doctors insert the balloons through a scope snaked down the throat and into the stomach, and then fill them with saline containing a blue dye. It takes about eight minutes to place the balloons, and about 14 minutes to remove them, according to Dr. Jaime Ponce, medical director of the bariatric surgery program at Hamilton Medical Center in Dalton, Ga. Ponce was the principal investigator of the clinical trial on the ReShape system. The device doesn't change the stomach's natural anatomy, according to the FDA. Patients are told to follow a medically supervised diet and exercise plan, to help them lose weight while they have the device in their stomach and to maintain weight loss after the device is removed. A pair of connected balloons are used because earlier single-balloon versions tended to dislodge and migrate down the digestive tract, blocking the bowels, Roslin explained. With ReShape, if one of the balloons ruptures then the other balloon will keep it in the stomach. The blue dye that filled the balloon will turn a patient's urine blue, letting the person know that one of the balloons has ruptured. Doctors can then go back in and retrieve the entire device. Nausea is a common side effect of the device. In the clinical trial, about 15 percent of patients had to have the balloons removed prematurely due to intolerable nausea, according to Ponce. ""The first few days are associated with a fair amount of nausea, and you will need some coaching to get through that,"" Roslin said. Another troubling side effect is gastric ulcers caused by the balloons rubbing against the stomach wall. About 35 percent of patients in the clinical trial suffered ulcers, but researchers said most of the ulcers were small and superficial. Roslin also believes that, for now, patients will have to pay cash for the ReShape. ""It is not going to be reimbursed by insurance, at least for the first generation and certainly for the foreseeable future,"" he said. The balloons have been available in Europe since 2011, where their average price is about $6,200, according to the manufacturer, ReShape Medical Inc. in California. The people who initially will use the ReShape are people who can afford to pay for it out-of-pocket and need to drop some pounds quickly, Roslin said. In the clinical trial, the 187 participants who used the device lost an average of more than 14 pounds, or about 7 percent of their total body weight. Patients who did not receive the device lost about half that amount of weight -- just over 3 percent of their total body weight, the FDA said.

"The study reported that ""taking aromatase inhibitors for 5 years reduced the risk of postmenopausal women with breast cancer dying of their disease by 40 percent within 10 years of starting treatment, compared with no hormonal treatment."" AD AD The results were part of the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Collaborative Group, a collaboration based at the University of Oxford, that collects and analyzes information about randomized clinical trials every few years. Paul Workman, professor and chief executive of the Institute of Cancer Research in London, said in a statement accompanying the publication of the journal article that ""the evidence on aromatase inhibitors has been accumulating for well over a decade, but it has taken this huge and complex study to make sense of all the data, and provide a firm basis for clinical guidelines."" AD ""It tends to be the discovery of new treatments that grabs the headlines, but it is just as important to maximize the benefit patients get from existing treatments through major, practice-changing studies like this,"" Workman said. AD The researchers wrote in the study that a substantial number of the trial participants switched from tamoxifen to aromatase inhibitors after they heard that it could reduce recurrence, which affected their results. If this had not happened, ""the benefit of aromatase inhibitors over tamoxifen would probably have been somewhat greater,"" they surmised. A separate analysis by the same group, also published in The Lancet, looked at bisphosphonates, which are typically used for osteoporosis. Researchers at Sheffield University found that in postmenopausal women during the first 10 years after diagnosis of breast cancer, the drug could reduce the risk of death by 18 per cent. AD Using the two drugs together as a one-two punch may be even more powerful. Richard Gray, a professor at the University of Oxford and who served as the lead statistician for both studies, said that half of all women with breast cancer are postmenopausal with hormone-sensitive tumors and could potentially benefit from both drugs. AD ""The drugs are complementary, because the main side effect of aromatase inhibitors is an increase in bone loss and fractures, while bisphosphonates reduce bone loss and fractures as well as improving survival,"" he said.

"A new pill may help gluten-free diners enjoy pizza, pasta and other gluten-containing fare they regularly have to avoid during social gatherings. Researchers at the University of Alberta have developed a pill using egg yolk antibodies that helps coat gluten, allowing it to pass from the body without doing any damage, the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) reported.

"A popular new type of prenatal test intended to find genetic flaws in a fetus can in rare cases also reveal previously undiagnosed cancer in the mother. The unexpected finding emerged in a study involving eight women who initially had abnormal results from the prenatal blood test, but for whom a subsequent assessment showed their babies were normal. When the mothers' DNA was reanalyzed, researchers said, the anomalies were linked to cancer in each of the women. Researchers said the report, presented Monday at a meeting of the International Society for Prenatal Diagnosis in Washington, D.C., underscores both challenges and opportunities for the tests, which have altered the prenatal testing landscape since they first hit the market in 2011. Related JAMA study The noninvasive prenatal blood tests can detect evidence of fetal abnormalities in the blood of a pregnant woman. That enables doctors to determine whether a fetus is at risk for such genetic abnormalities as Down syndrome with a blood test rather than with more invasive amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling that can, in rare cases, induce miscarriages. But as the new study shows, the unique ability to analyze both maternal and fetal DNA at the same time can lead to surprising results. ""When the test first came out we didn't think about cancer being a possibility,"" said Diana Bianchi, executive director of the Mother Infant Research Institute at Tufts Medical Center, Boston. ""I've been working in this field for 25 years, and it's something that we never expected to find."" Dr. Bianchi is lead author of the study, which was also published online by the Journal of the American Medical Association. While the noninvasive tests are considered highly accurate, Dr. Bianchi said the new findings underscore the need to have any positive result confirmed by amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling diagnostic test before considering whether to terminate a pregnancy or to plan for a child with developmental disabilities. ""Most of the time, the results do confirm the screening test,"" she said, but it is possible the initial result ""may have nothing to do with the fetus."" The tests are recommended only for women considered at high risk of carrying fetuses with chromosomal abnormalities, but they have been rapidly adopted by clinicians and patients. Since they first came on the market in 2011, more than 2 million tests have been performed world-wide, Dr. Bianchi said. Leading marketers of the tests are Illumina Inc., which funded the study, and Sequenom Inc., both in San Diego. The eight cases in the study came from a database of more than 125,000 blood samples submitted to Illumina between 2012 and 2014, of which 3,757, or 3%, were positive for at least one chromosomal abnormality associated with Down syndrome and other conditions. Among the very small number of instances where follow-up tests showed the fetus was normal, doctors later reported 10 cases of cancer. Among the eight women studied, three had their cancers diagnosed because of the abnormal findings. ""These women said they feel like their babies saved their lives because that was the finding that prompted the additional workup and treatment,"" Dr. Bianchi said. Unanticipated results from genetic tests, known as incidental findings, are the subject of ongoing debate among genetics experts and clinicians about the ethics of whether and how to divulge such information to patients. For instance, if a genetic test for a childhood disease turned up evidence of an elevated risk for breast cancer later in life, there is no consensus on when or how to inform the patient. In the case of maternal cancer, ""this is a very interesting incidental finding because it's something that potentially you need to take immediate action about,"" Dr. Bianchi said. The full implications of the new findings need further study, said Roberto Romero, a perinatology researcher at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development and colleagues in an editorial accompanying the study. With the growing popularity of the noninvasive tests, there is increased need ""to provide informed advice to potentially affected pregnant women"" and to help guide their care, they said.

"Novartis is considering trying so-called risk-sharing with some health plans, meaning it might charge more if the drug really does keep people out of the hospital and less if it doesn't. But such talks, while encouraging, are still in the early stages, a Novartis spokesman said. Timothy Anderson, pharmaceutical analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Company, said in a recent note that Entresto was ""likely to become a mega-brand over time"" but that the initial uptake was ""likely to be on the slower side given the entrenched nature of off-patent ACE inhibitors."" He said it was highly unusual that there were no major competitors for Entresto on the way, giving it a ""long runway."" In a clinical trial with more than 8,400 participants, patients were randomly assigned to take either Entresto or enalapril, an ACE inhibitor. Patients in both groups of the study could also take other drugs, such as beta blockers, as their doctors saw fit. After about 27 months, 21.8 percent of those taking Entresto had either died from cardiovascular causes or had been hospitalized for worsening heart failure, compared with 26.5 percent for those taking enalapril. That represented a relative risk reduction of 20 percent using a measure known as the hazard ratio. Novartis said that about 2.2 million Americans would be eligible for the drug, which was approved for patients with so-called Class II to Class IV chronic heart failure with so-called reduced ejection fraction. Novartis is sponsoring another study to see if the drug is effective for those with preserved ejection fraction, which accounts for half of heart failure cases. The F.D.A. said that the main side effects were low blood pressure, high blood potassium levels and kidney impairment. It said there were also cases of angioedema, an allergic reaction that usually results in swelling of the lips or face but can be life threatening if swelling interferes with breathing. Blacks and those with a previous history of the condition were at increased risk, it said. Entresto is a combination of two drugs, one of which is valsartan, the active ingredient in the blockbuster drug that Novartis sells as Diovan but which now faces generic competition.

"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, July 6, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A scan of calcium deposits inside your arteries can help doctors deduce how long you're likely to live, a new study has found. The test, called a coronary calcium scan, uses a regular CT scan to look for calcium deposits in the three major arteries that carry blood away from the heart, said lead author Leslee Shaw, a professor of cardiology at Emory University in Atlanta. People with the largest amounts of calcium in their arteries carry an early death risk that's six times greater than those with no calcium deposits, researchers found in a 15-year study of nearly 10,000 patients. ""If you had no calcium or very small amounts, we were able to track over a very long time that you actually had a very outstanding survival,"" Shaw said. Calcium deposits develop as a response to plaque formation along the artery walls, Shaw said. These plaques, which are caused by blood cholesterol, build up over time and cause arteries to narrow, leading to heart disease as the heart works harder to pump blood through the body. If a plaque bursts, a blood clot can form on its surface, blocking blood flow and causing a heart attack, according to the U.S. National Institutes of Health. If the clot breaks free, it can flow into the brain and cause a stroke. To prevent plaques from bursting, the body tries to harden them by depositing calcium salts over and around them, Shaw said. Doctors learned in the 1990s that these calcified plaques show up on CT scans, and can be used to determine whether a person is suffering from hardening of the arteries, Shaw said. Up to now, however, there's been little evidence showing that a calcium scan can provide a solid assessment of a person's long-term health risk, the study authors said in background information. Most studies involving these scans have a follow-up of five years or less. In this new study, doctors referred 9,715 healthy patients in the Nashville area between 1996 and 1999 to a cardiology outreach screening program provided by the military's Tricare Healthcare System. The patients underwent a calcium scan, and also provided a detailed history of their heart risk factors. Researchers then tracked the participants for roughly 15 years, taking special note of the 936 patients who died. Analysis revealed that the risk of premature death steadily increased with the amount of calcium deposits found in a person's major arteries. Patients with small levels of arterial calcium had a 68 percent increased overall risk of death, compared to those with no calcium deposits at all. But people with the largest calcium deposits in their arteries had a death risk six times greater than those with no calcium. ""This is not a new test, but these results emphasize the importance of looking at this marker in addition to the traditional risk factors,"" said Dr. William Zoghbi, past president of the American College of Cardiology and head of cardiovascular imaging for Houston Methodist Hospital. Calcium scans are currently used to help doctors determine the best treatment for patients who have no heart symptoms but do have high cholesterol or a family history of heart problems, Zoghbi said. This study confirms their usefulness in that regard, he said. ""Calcium scoring really is the earliest marker in the development of hardening of the arteries in people who have no symptoms,"" he said. ""The best use is in patients who have no symptoms, but the value of the test is not well known."" The results of a calcium scan can be reassuring for people with few or no calcium deposits, and can provide people with high calcium levels with added impetus to take better care of themselves, Shaw said. ""It can be a very potent motivator,"" she said. People with many calcium deposits can improve their long-term prospects by eating right, exercising, and taking medication to treat heart risk factors such as high blood pressure, elevated blood cholesterol and type 2 diabetes, Shaw said. Shaw thinks calcium scans ultimately could become part of a person's regular physical exam, as common as blood cholesterol tests. They generally cost less than $100, she said. ""I think it's headed that way,"" she said. ""We're kind of on the edge of this becoming more accepted."" The findings appear in the July 7 issue of Annals of Internal Medicine.

"The logo of Bayer AG is pictured at the Bayer Healthcare subgroup production plant in Wuppertal February 24, 2014. REUTERS/Ina Fassbender (Reuters) - Bayer Healthcare said on Wednesday the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved using transvaginal ultrasound as an alternate test to confirm if the company's Essure permanent birth control device has been placed properly. Essure is a small metal coil inserted into woman's fallopian tubes. But since its approval in 2002, women using the device have sent the FDA more than 5,000 complaints, ranging from pain and menstrual problems to pregnancies and even deaths. Some of the complaints related to the placement of the device. In a transvaginal ultrasound (TVU), sound waves emitted from a probe placed in vagina help a physician check if Essure has been placed properly. This test is an alternative to the generally-prescribed modified hysterosalpingogram (HSG) test in which an x-ray of the uterus and fallopian tubes is used to check for proper device placement. A woman using Essure must do a test to confirm that the device is properly placed within three months of the procedure and until she receives a confirmation from her doctor, she must use alternate birth control methods, Bayer said in a statement on Wednesday. All physicians who offer Essure are expected to be trained to perform the TVU confirmation test by mid-2016, the company said. The training will start in September, the same month the FDA will hold a public panel meeting to discuss the safety and effectiveness of Essure.",0,story_reviews_00589
"(Reuters Health) – Patients who need to be rehospitalized within a month after major surgery have a lower risk of death over the next two months if they return to the hospital where they had the surgery rather than going to a different facility, according to a new study. ""Most clinicians or surgeons feel like if you take the time to do a big operation on someone, you know the area operated on, how the operations went, if there were complications,"" lead author Dr. Benjamin S. Brooke of the University of Utah School of Medicine in Salt Lake City told Reuters Health by phone. Doctors who did not perform the surgery won't have that context, which may explain part of the survival benefit of returning to the original hospital, he said. He and his team analyzed Medicare claims data from 2001 to 2011 on patients readmitted to the hospital within 30 days after major surgeries, including coronary artery bypass surgery, removal of the colon or pancreas, and hip or knee replacement. More than nine million patients underwent one of 12 such surgeries during the study period, and between six and 22 percent, depending on the surgery, were readmitted to the hospital within a month. More than half the time, patients were readmitted or transferred to the hospital where they had the surgery. Those who returned to the original hospital were 26 percent less likely to die within three months of surgery than those admitted to a different hospital, as reported in The Lancet. ""Patients readmitted after surgery almost always have a postoperative complication, either medical or surgical,"" Drs. Justin B. Dimick and David C. Miller, both of the University of Michigan, wrote in an editorial. Patients readmitted at the original hospital also tended to be readmitted one to two days earlier than those who ended up at different hospitals. It might be harder for patients to get appropriate care at the other hospitals, where they don't have a pre-existing relationship with a surgeon, and so treatment might be delayed, Dimick and Miller wrote. ""If you are a surgeon or clinician who takes care of this person, it's intuitive that going back to that surgeon would influence how well they do,"" Brooke said. For complex operations, some patients will fly to prestigious hospitals from several hundred miles away, he said. If these patients have complications weeks later, they end up going to a local hospital, not the one where they had surgery. ""A lot of big Fortune 500 companies contract with bigger hospitals for patients undergoing major surgery,"" Brooke said, noting the Wal-Mart has contracted with the Cleveland Clinic. ""Even if they live in the same city where they had their surgery, they might have to call an ambulance to pick them up, and the ambulance drivers don't understand how important it is to take them to the same hospital,"" he said. Ambulance drivers and emergency department doctors should make every effort to get a patient who has had major surgery back to their original hospital, he said. ""A lot of readmissions are patients who have time to be transferred or triaged, if they are not bleeding to death or having a heart attack,"" he said. Patients should try to stay in the immediate vicinity of their surgical hospital for at least a week, Brooke said.

"By Dennis Thompson HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, June 29, 2015 (HealthDay News) -- A device that grabs and drags a blood clot out through the blood vessels should be used to treat certain stroke victims, according to new guidelines issued by the American Heart Association. Nearly nine out of 10 strokes are caused by a blood clot that blocks one of the arteries supplying blood to the brain, the American Heart Association (AHA) said. Standard stroke treatment relies on powerful blood-thinning medications that break up the clot and restore blood flow to the brain. But when those drugs don't work, doctors now can turn to a new catheter-based device that will physically remove the blood clot, said Dr. William Powers, lead author of the updated AHA guidelines and chair of neurology at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill. The tool, called an endovascular stent retrieval device, is made up of wire mesh that resembles a tiny ring of chicken wire, Powers said. Skilled surgeons run the device up through a person's arteries via a catheter, and then open it smack in the middle of a stroke-causing blood clot. ""If you actually deploy or open one in the middle of a clot, it smooshes out and the clot gets caught in the chicken wire, and then you pull the whole thing out back through the artery,"" Powers said. The new guidelines were published June 29 in the journal Stroke. The AHA issued its updated guidelines based primarily on the results of six new clinical trials released within the past eight months, Powers said. All of these studies showed that the device can safely and effectively stop a stroke by removing blood clots, he added. A number of other medical societies have endorsed the AHA's new guidelines, including the American Association of Neurological Surgeons and the Society of Vascular and Interventional Neurology. As with other stroke treatments, time is of the essence. The procedure must start within six hours of the onset of a stroke, which means that emergency teams and hospitals will have to move fast, Powers said. The guidelines provide added incentive to quickly transfer stroke victims from a local hospital to a major stroke center capable of advanced treatment, said Powers and Dr. David Kandzari, director of interventional cardiology and chief scientific officer for the Piedmont Heart Institute in Atlanta. Local hospitals currently are urged to ""drip and ship"" people experiencing a major stroke -- essentially, start an IV drip of the powerful clot-busting drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA), and then ship them by ambulance or helicopter to the nearest comprehensive stroke center for further treatment, Kandzari said. Stent retrieval devices make that quick hospital transfer even more important, since the gadgets provide a crucial backup for tPA but are more tricky to use. ""These are procedures performed by very specialized individuals,"" Kandzari said. ""They are not regularly performed by cardiologists or radiologists or neurologists. Hospitals must make plans to get people to other centers that are capable of this catheter-based therapy,"" he explained. Powers said, ""I think what's going to happen is that we will develop systems of rapid triage and rapid transport. A lot of this at this point depends on logistics and manpower. The people who do this are specially trained. You need a lot of special training to get those catheters up into the brain and pull things out."" The guidelines specifically recommend using a stent retrieval device for people who: Didn't have any significant disability prior to their current stroke. Received tPA within 4.5 hours of their stroke onset, and can start the procedure within six hours after stroke symptoms started. Are at least 18 years old, as clinical trials have not been conducted with children. Have imaging scans that show more than half of the brain on the side of the stroke is not permanently damaged. Have a clot blocking a large artery supplying blood to the brain. That last point is especially important, because the stent retrieval device will not fit into the smaller blood vessels that branch out further into the brain, Powers said. The major risk of using the device is that it could tear an artery and cause bleeding in the brain, particularly since it will be used on people who have already received very potent blood thinners, Kandzari said. But clinical trials have shown that the risk of brain bleeding for people who received tPA and then went through mechanical clot removal is no greater than for people who just receive the blood thinner, Powers said. ""The outcomes were uniformly positive in all of the trials,"" he said. ""It's really, really good evidence.""

"Researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston have identified a large and readily detectable molecule that circulates in the blood and has identified, with perfect accuracy and no false positives, the presence of pancreatic cancer in a small group of subjects. Searching blood samples of pancreatic cancer patients and controls for a distinctive molecule given off by the malignancy, scientists were even able to distinguish subjects with benign pancreatic disease from those with early-stage cancer. The telltale sign of pancreas cancer was found in protein- and nucleic-acid-filled sacs called exosomes, which circulate in the bloodstream. Spinning blood samples in a centrifuge, researchers found they could break open those sacs and readily detect a protein called glypican-1, which is overexpressed in breast and pancreatic cancers. The finding ""offers the possibility for early detection of pancreatic cancer and help in designing potential curative surgical options,"" the authors of the new research wrote. For a cancer that has already metastasized in four of five patients newly diagnosed, earlier detection holds a strong promise of improving pancreatic cancer's dismal survival rate, they added. Advertisement Pancreatic cancer is the deadliest of all common cancers in the United States. An estimated 44,000 are diagnosed with the malignancy each year in the country, usually when it has reached a very advanced stage and few treatment options are effective. Just 5% of those diagnosed with this form of malignancy survive five or more years. Clotilde Thery, a cancer researcher at France's Institut Curie, greeted the possibility with enthusiasm. ""The potential implications of such a test are huge,"" Thery wrote in an editorial published alongside the study, in the journal Nature. Although she said its findings need to be replicated in much larger groups, she hailed the finding as ""clinically important."" UC San Francisco cancer physician Alan Venook cautioned, however, that much more needs to be known about the telltale sign of cancer explored in the new research before its lifesaving properties can be established. Advertisement ""The issue is, can you detect these in patients that don't have advanced cancer?"" Venook said. ""The answer is, we don't know."" The numbers tested by the MD Anderson researchers -- 251 patients with pancreatic cancer (five of whom had very early lesions), 32 with chronic pancreatitis and 120 healthy controls -- aren't nearly large enough to draw such conclusions. And getting a clear answer, Venook said, would probably require lengthy and expensive studies on very large populations. ------------ FOR THE RECORD June 25, 4:06 p.m.: An earlier version of this article underreported the number of people tested for the glypican-1 protein by the MD Anderson researchers. Participants with pancreatic cancer numbered 251, not 56; healthy controls numbered 120, not 20; those with chronic pancreatitis numbered 32, not six. ------------ ""Don't get me wrong, this is where we start.

"""Nobody was interested,"" he said. Around that time, in France, Dr. Alain Cribier, a cardiologist at Hôpital Charles Nicolle, in Rouen, was thinking along the same lines. He was a highly regarded, successful innovator, so he thought it would be easy to find a company. ""I started looking for companies to help me, but it was a complete failure,"" he said. ""All the companies in the United States and Europe and Japan, they have experts, and the experts are surgeons and they said it is absolutely not possible. We would kill the patients on the table."" He joined forces with a former Johnson & Johnson executive, Stanton Rowe, who began making the rounds of venture capitalists. But, Mr. Rowe said, their response was always the same: "" ‘We will look into it.' And who do they call? The surgeons. They told them all the reasons why it won't work."" Dr. Cohn, the Harvard heart surgeon, said he and his colleagues had good reasons to look askance. They thought it was strange that the old valve would just remain in the heart. They wondered why the new one would not fly off into the rush of blood being pumped into the aorta — after all, it was not being sewn in. And pushing a valve into an atherosclerotic artery? Pieces of plaque could break off and cause blood clots and strokes. Finally, he added, it would take patients away from surgeons. ""We were skeptical,"" he said. Two and a half years later, after Dr. Cribier had practiced inserting valves in sheep, a 57-year-old man arrived at his hospital needing an aortic valve, on the brink of death, with almost no heartbeat. He had so many medical problems — severe coronary artery disease, chronic pancreatitis — that surgery was not an option. Then again, no human had ever had a valve put in without surgery. ""I had to ask the patient his wish,"" Dr. Cribier said. ""His response was, ‘Please, please do it.' "" ""It was the most stressful day for me,"" he said. Sheep, he explained, do not develop aortic stenosis, and their anatomy is very different. ""We were not sure we could translate it into man,"" he said.",0,story_reviews_00600
"A systematic review of C.B.T. for insomnia, published in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, quantifies how much relief it can provide. Combining data from 20 clinical trials, which included over 1,000 patients with chronic insomnia, the authors calculated sleep improvements after C.B.T. treatment, relative to no treatment. On average, treated patients fell asleep almost 20 minutes faster and were awake in the night almost half an hour less. The total amount of time that they were sleeping when in bed increased by nearly 10 percent. These results are similar to or better than improvements from many sleep drugs, and lasted longer. My experience is consistent with these averages. The C.B.T. treatment I received, through an online program recommended by my doctor, also included keeping careful track of how much sleep I got each night. This proved very helpful. It demonstrated progress — the nights in which I got only four or five hours of sleep became less common, and, on average, my nights of sleep lengthened by 30 minutes. My sleep log also helped me be more objective. Many nights I might have considered ""bad"" — and fretted over — were ones in which I got only one hour less sleep than my target of seven hours. Recognizing that's not really so bad helped me relax, and relaxing helped me get more and better sleep. Improvements like mine and those reported in the study bring sleep statistics for those with insomnia quite close to those without it. This further emphasizes the point that many insomniacs aren't that different from normal sleepers. Many sleep fine most nights, but also have more frequent nights of insufficient sleep than normal sleepers would experience. A big part of the difference may be how insomniacs perceive their sleep performance and the negative messages they give themselves about their poor sleep and how it will affect their daily lives. C.B.T. practitioners learn that if you label a night of sleep ""bad"" and expect a bad day to follow a bad night of sleep, you're more likely to get it, as well as more likely to be anxious the next time you attempt to sleep. In this way, unless exacerbated by physical causes — like sleep apnea or restless leg syndrome — insomnia is a condition of the mind that then infects the body. Like a patch on faulty software, C.B.T. reorients one's thinking and behavior so that sleep is first thought to be, and then soon after actually is, a more positive experience. Drugs, on the other hand, just treat insomniacs' symptoms without addressing the underlying cause, which is why the relief they provide may be less durable. For me, and many patients, C.B.T. works. And as studies show, it works better than drugs. That moment with my children, a couple of years ago, was the last time I fell asleep reading to them.",0,story_reviews_00604
"CHICAGO—Using whole-brain radiation to treat cancer that has spread to the brain is a treatment that for many patients is worse than the disease, a new study suggests. Researchers said the technique, when used after a more precise radiotherapy to kill the cancer, resulted in more memory loss and other cognitive deficits than treating with radiotherapy alone. While the more aggressive treatment was better at preventing recurrence of tumors in the brain, it didn't extend survival. ""The potential benefits of whole brain radiation therapy are far outweighed by the detriments of the therapy itself,"" said Paul Brown, professor of radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, Houston. The ""negative impact"" on cognitive function ""was more than I would have expected."" Dr. Brown is lead author of the study which was presented Sunday at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. The study involved 213 patients who had one to three small tumors, or metastases in the brain. It was funded by the National Institutes of Health. Brain metastases is a common problem in cancer affecting an estimated 400,000 to 600,000 patients annually in the U.S. alone, some 200,000 of whom get whole brain radiation during the course of their disease. Lung cancer is the most common malignancy to spread to the brain, followed by breast cancer and melanoma. Whole brain radiation was first used in 1954 and has long been a standard strategy for brain metastases, said Andrew Lassman, chief of neuro-oncology at New York-Presbyterian/Columbia University Medical Center. Though doctors have curbed its use in recent years amid concerns over its deleterious effect on cognitive function, whether the treatment or recurrence of metastases is worse for the patient has remained controversial, he said. Whole brain radiation is typically administered in 10 20-minute treatments given over two weeks while radiosurgery, in which radiation is delivered in a powerful, focused beam with instruments known by such names as the gammaknife, is a longer procedure given in a single day. For the study, patients were randomly assigned to either radiosurgery followed by whole brain radiation or radiosurgery alone. Patients then underwent seven cognitive tests three months after treatment and at several subsequent intervals. Patients treated with both approaches performed significantly worse three months later on tests involving immediate recall of words, delayed recall and measures of verbal communication. Patients given both treatments also scored lower on a quality of life questionnaire, Dr. Brown said. Median overall survival was 7.5 months for those receiving both treatments and 10.7 months for those on radiosurgery alone, a result considered statistically about the same. The study will ""push the use of whole-brain radiation therapy more toward the latter portion of the patient's course, when they have no more good viable options,"" Dr. Brown said. The new report is ""the most comprehensive study that lets us quantify the risk/benefit"" of the treatment, said Brian M. Alexander, a radiation oncologist at Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Boston. Dr Lassman said the findings conflict with some other studies. He said patients for whom brain metastases rather than their primary cancer pose the biggest threat to survival, for instance, may benefit from whole-brain radiation. Dr. Lassman added that both whole brain radiation and recurrent metastases are ""bad for the brain."" He said researchers are studying alternate approaches, including irradiating the brain while shielding the hippocampus, a component of the brain critical to memory, and giving certain drugs used to treat dementia that may protect the brain against the effects of radiation.

"A new study could change the way doctors treat patients at high risk for skin cancer. It doesn't involve any high-priced new pharmaceuticals -- the key may be an over-the-counter vitamin supplement that costs less than $10 a month. Researchers found that a form of vitamin B3 called nicotinamide could help reduce the chance of skin cancer recurring in patients who've had it before. (Another popular form of Vitamin B3 called niacin was not used in this study.) For the study, researchers in Australia looked at nearly 400 people who had had at least two non-melanoma skin cancers. They found patients who took vitamin B3 twice a day cut their chances of developing new skin cancers by 23 percent. ""That's a dramatic number,"" Dr. David Agus, director of USC's Norris Westside Cancer Center, told ""CBS This Morning."" ""It could make a major impact."" Vitamin B3 could help skin cancer patients Dr. Jae Jung, a dermatologist at City of Hope cancer center in Duarte, California, agreed. ""If you can reduce the new skin cancer rates for these patients, it would be an enormous benefit,"" she told CBS News. How does it work? Sunlight's ultraviolet (UV) rays can damage the DNA in skin cells, increasing the risk for skin cancer. Researchers say vitamin B3 gives skin cells an energy boost -- ""turns back on the immune system,"" in Agus's words -- helping them repair the damage. Nearly 5 million people are treated for skin cancer in the U.S. each year, and the Skin Cancer Foundation says 1 out of 5 Americans will develop skin cancer in their lifetime. The two most common forms of the disease, basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, can usually be treated successfully. The most dangerous type, melanoma, occurs in about 73,000 people in the U.S. each year and kills more than 9,900. One patient who could benefit from the vitamin treatment is Charity Wiese, who has been diagnosed with skin cancer more than two dozen times in the last five years. She said she's had ""quite a few on the top of my head, a few on the back of my head, one behind each ear,"" even though she tries to stay out of the sun. Wiese had leukemia as a teenager and underwent radiation therapy, which put her at high risk for skin cancer later in life. Wiese thinks the vitamin study sounds promising. ""I am absolutely willing to try it and hope for the best,"" she said. Doctors involved in the study are excited by their findings on vitamin B3 nicotinamide. ""It's safe, it's almost obscenely inexpensive, and it's already widely commercially available,"" Dr. Diona Damian, the senior author of the study and a professor of dermatology at the University of Sydney, told HealthDay. But she said more reserach is needed to see if everyone benefits from it. ""It's not something we'd recommend at this stage for the general population,"" Damian said. She also noted that the benefits appear to wear off when patients stop taking the supplements. Results of the study are being presented at the annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology later this month.",0,story_reviews_00619
"For Headaches, A Lifestyle Change May Be Better Than A Doctor Visit Enlarge this image Keith Negley for NPR Keith Negley for NPR Terri Bradford has suffered debilitating headaches all her life. Some days the pain is so bad, she says, ""By 11 o'clock in the morning, I'm on the couch in a darkened room with my head packed in ice."" ""I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count."" Over the years, Bradford, who is 50 years old and lives in Bedford, Mass., has searched desperately for pain relief. She's been to the doctor countless times for countless tests. ""Everything I've had, I've had twice,"" she says. ""I've had two spinal taps; I've had so many nerve blocks I've lost count."" Bradford is not alone. It's estimated that every year 12 million Americans go to the doctor seeking help for headaches. Nearly one quarter of the population suffers from recurrent severe tension headaches or migraines. People who go to the doctor for headaches are increasingly likely to be sent for advanced testing and treatment, a study finds. That testing is expensive, it may not be necessary and it could even be harmful, says lead researcher Dr. John Mafi, of Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center in Boston. Mafi looked at the rates of advanced imaging like CT scans and MRIs in people with headaches, as well as referrals to other doctors, presumably specialists. He found that from 1999 to 2010, the number of diagnostic tests rose from 6.7 percent of all doctor visits to 13.9 percent. At the same time, referrals to other doctors increased from 6.9 percent to 13.2 percent. In other words, almost double what it was a decade ago. Mafi says this isn't because more people are suffering headaches. The headache rate has remained virtually the same over the past decade. But what has changed is supply and demand. Today there are a lot more advanced diagnostic machines than there were a decade ago, and more patients are asking to be tested. ""There's a subconscious perception that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care."" ""Patients are more assertive than ever before,"" Mafi says. ""They do research online, are more informed and sometimes go to the doctor demanding, 'I think I need an MRI.' "" And while an informed patient is a good thing, Mafi says sometimes the patient gets it wrong. ""I think there's a subconscious perception that more is better, and that fancier, more expensive tests are better and that equals better care."" Mafi's study did not include patients with tumors or other serious problems that can cause headaches. He only looked at otherwise healthy patients who suffered chronic headaches. And in these cases, repeated diagnostic testing can lead to further unnecessary procedures like biopsies. On top of that, exposure to radiation in tests like CT scans adds up over time and can increase the risk of certain cancers. For Terri Bradford, the years of searching for effective treatment proved futile. ""I've been to four neurologists. A lot of them have given up on me because I haven't gotten any better,"" she says. Eventually Bradford ended up at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, where neurologist Carolyn Bernstein directs the Comprehensive Headache Center. Bernstein says she sees lots of desperate patients like Bradford. ""The majority of them have really been suffering a number of years and they're really miserable with the pain,"" Bernstein says. They say, "" 'I hope you have a magic pill,' and of course there is no magic pill."" There is just no single reason why people get chronic headaches, although we do know that migraines have a genetic component and usually a trigger. ""If you are a migraine sufferer and I expose you to the right trigger, you're going to have a migraine,"" Bernstein says. But the triggers are different for different people. They can include poor diet, too much sugar or certain types of alcohol. Problems sleeping, stress, lack of exercise or a combination of any number of these things can cause chronic headaches. At the headache center, patients receive a thorough medical history that includes headache patterns, disability and mood assessments. Then the center works with patients to try to identify what triggers their headaches and how they can avoid those triggers in the future. Some people find relief through exercise. ""I write an exercise prescription probably as often as I write a prescription for medication,"" Bernstein says. She acknowledges it's sometimes difficult to encourage a patient with cracking head pain to get up and exercise. But even a little can help, and according to Bernstein it doesn't have to be jogging for miles and miles. It can be yoga, tai chi or even just a little stretching. A big lifestyle adjustment worked for Terri Bradford. She started exercising and changed her diet, giving up gluten, dairy and sugar. And she learned how to meditate to reduce stress. All these changes, she says, have made a huge difference. She has far fewer headaches and when she does have them, they're far less severe. ""I'm finally healing,"" she says.",0,story_reviews_00622
"Severely premature babies are more likely to live if they receive intensive-care treatments rather than palliative care to keep them comfortable, according to a U.S. government-funded study published Thursday. Whether babies born at the extreme edge of viability, generally considered to be 22, 23 or 24 weeks of gestation, should be aggressively medically treated is a controversial issue among pediatric experts. These infants often don't survive and, even if they do, many have substantial long-term health problems. This new study, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, provides what is thought to be the best, large-scale data in the U.S. to date on this topic. The authors, from many institutions that form a large neonatal research network funded by the National Institutes of Health, studied nearly 5,000 babies born before 27 weeks at two-dozen high-quality hospitals across the country who were followed to 18-22 months of age. Those who were born at 22 weeks of gestation survived only 5% of the time. Of those who received active treatment to help them breathe or their hearts to beat, 23% lived, 15.4% survived without severe neurological impairment, such as cerebral palsy, and 9% survived without severe or moderate neurological impairment. In comparison, the vast majority—more than 80% -- of those born at week 26 survived with or without active care and nearly 60% had no severe or moderate neurological impairment. ""A large proportion of the variation [in outcome], especially at 22, 23 and 24 weeks, can be explained by differences in whether treatment was initiated,"" said Matthew Rysavy, the first author on the paper and a medical student at the University of Iowa. The findings don't lead to a clear-cut conclusion about when and whether lifesaving care should be administered to the extremely premature, but provide more data to help inform doctors and families when they make their decision, said Mr. Rysavy. Just 22% of babies born at 22 weeks were given lifesaving treatments compared with 72% of babies born at week 23 and 97% of babies born at week 24. The type of care they received tended to depend on the hospital where they were born. However, it isn't clear from the data why the decision was made to provide a particular type of care, and what other factors played a role in the babies' outcomes besides whether they were given active treatments, said the authors. Elizabeth Rogers, director of the Intensive Care Nursery Follow Up Program at the UCSF Benioff Children's Hospital San Francisco , who wasn't involved in the study, called the new study important because it highlights the large variation in outcomes for these very premature infants. The paper ""shows that the question of when a premature infant can survive is so multifactorial and complex that no simple equation is going to be able to predict the outcome for any individual baby,"" said Dr. Rogers, a pediatrics professor. The study suggests that with intervention, more babies may live. ""But if meaningful, functional, fully participatory life is what they want, I think the study also shows this is not something we can promise them at these ages,"" said Dr. Rogers. The University of California San Francisco has never resuscitated a baby born at 22 weeks because its own data suggest that at such an early gestational age, the ""risks of poor outcome have outweighed the possibility of a really good outcome for families,"" said Dr. Rogers, who said she wouldn't change her clinical practice based on the new study results. Thursday's findings also highlight the importance for counseling parents, including about their child's longer-term prognosis, and the need for a standard approach of what and how to tell them, according to Dr. Rogers. Part of that conversation could be the survival rate not of all babies born at an early gestational age, but just those who received active treatment, said the University of Iowa's Mr. Rysavy. At the University of Iowa's hospital, after having a conversation with parents of babies born at 22 weeks, the majority want their babies treated, said Edward Bell, another author on the paper and a pediatrics professor at the university. ""These are very difficult decisions and they need to made on a case-by-case basis by the families and physicians,"" said Dr. Bell. Corrections & Amplifications: Elizabeth Rogers's last name was misspelled as Rodgers in an earlier version of this article (5/8/15). Also, a statistical result from the study was incorrectly described in an earlier version of this article. The survival rate for all week 22 infants reflected those who received active treatment as well as those who didn't, not just those who didn't receive active treatment (5/12/15). Write to Shirley S.

"Unlike lumps in breasts, for example, ""nothing in your lungs allows you to sense the presence of a nodule or mass,"" said Dr. Douglas Arenberg, director of the lung cancer screening program at the University of Michigan Medical School. With treatment, usually surgery, 70 percent to 80 percent of patients with Stage 1 lung cancer, and half of those with Stage 2, survive for at least five years. But most lung cancer is diagnosed when the disease is more advanced, leading to lousy overall mortality rates: Just 18 percent of all lung cancer patients survive for five years. Pulmonologists have tried for years to find ways to detect lung cancer earlier. Experiments using ordinary chest X-rays proved disappointing. Then in 2011, researchers running the National Lung Screening Trial, involving 53,454 smokers and former smokers ages 55 to 74, reported encouraging findings: Patients who received a low-dose CT scan annually for three years were 20 percent less likely to die of lung cancer over an average of 6.5 years than those tested with X-rays. Those results led to the preventive services task force's endorsement and, eventually, to Medicare's approval. ""We're covering evidence-based preventive services for beneficiaries, which will save lives,"" Dr. Conway said. How many lives? While the overwhelming number of people with lung cancer are or were smokers, most smokers don't develop lung cancer. So although a 20 percent reduction in mortality sounds impressive, it represents a small number of people. In the national trial, those screened with chest X-rays had about a 1.7 percent chance of dying from lung cancer during the study period; in the CT scan group, it was about 1.4 percent. For every thousand people screened with a low-dose CT, three fewer died of lung cancer. Lay people struggle to grasp these kinds of numbers. ""They look at me and say, ‘Doc, just tell me what to do,' "" Dr. Arenberg said. Or they give a how-can-it-hurt shrug and opt in: Maybe they'll be among the three in 1,000 saved.",0,story_reviews_00625

"In 2012, I was shocked to learn that new guidelines issued by the The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists stated that women should wait three to five years between pap smears, which are the primary method of screening for cervical cancer. Thanks to that recommendation, which has influenced insurance company policies, annual pap tests are no longer the standard of care today— and I see that as a huge problem. For one, the three- to five-year interval between screening tests for women ages 21 to 65 doesn't take into account the several risk factors that boost a woman's chance of developing cervical cancer, such as multiple sexual partners, a weakened immune system that occurs with smoking, and even oral contraceptive use for more than five years. For these women, there is a still a serious need for more frequent cervical cancer screening, but nowhere in the guidelines are these risk factors addressed. Unfortunately, the only risk factor that changes the recommended frequency of screening is an abnormal pap result in the past. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT I watched a 28-year-old woman die of cervical cancer during my OB-GYN residency, and it was horrible. I don't see why major medical organizations have made a recommendation that puts women at risk of a cancer that can be so easily prevented— and frankly, I see it as more of an economic decision than anything else. Let's take a closer look at what this means: Let's say you have multiple sexual partners and during a visit to your gynecologist, this information flies under the radar for whatever reason. (A woman with multiple sexual partners has a greater chance of acquiring HPV, the virus that causes most cervical cancers.) By the same token, no one brings up the issue of your partner's number of partners. And by the way, you can never be 100 percent positive that your partner is monogamous— no one can! The greater the number of partners he has, the greater his risk of contracting HPV and passing it to you. So you aren't given cervical cancer screening that day when, in fact, many doctors would agree that you need it. Another problem I have with the current guidelines is this: New recommendations published last summer in the Annals of Internal Medicine advised physicians to stop offering routine pelvic exams to asymptomatic, average-risk women. I find this outrageous. Pelvic exams allow your physician to inspect the vulva for changes, and even feel around the ovaries, uterus, and fallopian tubes for any masses. The delay to diagnosis of vulvar cancer, specifically, is about 18 months. A gynecologist is trained to detect early changes, and then do a biopsy for anything suspicious. As a diagnostic and screening tool, the pelvic exam is vital. What makes all of this even worse: No more pelvic exams and infrequent paps mean women won't see their gynecologist as regularly, and they may miss opportunities to voice concerns related to their reproductive health. An annual well-woman visit with your gynecologist allows you to discuss your health status, sexual practices, contraception needs, and get a breast exam, among other things— so it's still important for you to go, even if you don't end up having a pap or pelvic exam. Ultimately, when it comes to gynecological cancer screening tests, every woman has individual risk factors, so you should talk to your doctor about yours. If you fall into any of the high risk categories— you have multiple partners, you smoke or are otherwise immunocompromised, and you've been on birth control pills for five years or more— you really should be screened at least every other year. If you're insurance denies to cover this, you should fight them on the basis of being at a higher risk. And always be sure to visit your gyno if you're having any sort of symptom, such as pelvic pain, irregular discharge, or sexual dysfunction— all of which can point to a more serious problem. In these cases, you should be given a pelvic exam at the very least.

"Cancer experts said Tuesday that the actress and filmmaker Angelina Jolie Pitt was wise to have had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed last week because she carries a genetic mutation, BRCA1, that significantly increases the risk of ovarian cancer, a disease so difficult to detect that it is often found only at an advanced, untreatable stage. They also said Ms. Jolie Pitt's decision to discuss her own choices so frankly will encourage women in similar situations to consider their own options. BRCA mutations cause about 5 to 10 percent of breast cancers and 10 to 15 percent of ovarian cancers among white women in the United States. It is unclear how common the mutations are in other racial and ethnic groups. ""Prophylactic removal of ovaries and fallopian tubes is strongly recommended in women before age 40 in BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers,"" said Dr. Susan Domchek, executive director of the University of Pennsylvania's Basser Research Center, which specializes in BRCA mutations. ""There is no effective screening for ovarian cancer and too many women with advanced stage ovarian cancer die of their disease."" Writing for The New York Times's Op-Ed page, Ms. Jolie Pitt, 39, said she had expected to have her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed, a procedure called a laparoscopic bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy, but that a cancer scare made her decide to undergo the procedure sooner.

"Diseases like Alzheimer's start years, even decades, before the first symptoms of memory loss shows up. And with rates of those diseases rising, experts say that more primary care physicians—not neurology experts—will have the task of identifying these patients early so they can take advantage of whatever early interventions might be available. ""If we had a simple blood test, a cholesterol test for Alzheimer's disease, that would help,"" says Dr. Ronald Petersen, director of the Alzheimer's Disease Research Center at the Mayo Clinic, ""but we don't."" But Petersen has a potential solution, and according to a new paper released Wednesday in the journal Neurology, his Alzheimer's test has promise. Petersen and his team wanted to develop a test that any physician can administer to patients, without the need for any new technology or expensive equipment. Petersen believes that the test they came up with could become a useful tool for any physician, even those without special training in the brain. ""What we are trying to do is give them some help so they can be as efficient as possible without ignoring these important cognitive issues,"" he says. In the first phase of the test, his researchers simply collected information from 1,500 patients' medical charts—their age, family history of Alzheimer's, factors such as diabetes or smoking that have been linked to Alzheimer's, and whether the patient had ever reported problems with memory. In the next phase they studied the results of the patient's basic mental exam as well as of a psychiatric evaluation, because depression and anxiety have been connected to Alzheimer's. And another factor that emerged as important in developing the disease—how quickly the participant could walk a short distance. ""We were a little surprised,"" says Petersen. ""But what's nice about it is that it's a nice non-cognitive, motor factor so it's looking at another aspect of brain function."" MORE: This Alzheimer's Breakthrough Could Be a Game Changer Petersen suggests that every physician should get this information on their patients at age 65; that way, they can have a baseline against which to compare any changes as their patients age. Only if they show such changes — a slower walk, for example, or worsening signs of depression or memory issues — should they move on to the third phase of the test, which is a blood analysis. That would look for known genetic factors linked to Alzheimer's, including the presence of certain versions of the ApoE gene. Currently, the only way to truly separate out those on the road to Alzheimer's is to conduct expensive imaging tests of the brain, or to do a spinal tap, an invasive procedure that extracts spinal fluid for signs of the amyloid protein that builds up in the disease. ""We have either expensive techniques or invasive techniques and it's not practical to do them from a public health screening standpoint,"" says Petersen. Get The Brief.

MORE: New Test May Predict Alzheimer's 10 Years Before Diagnosis While his test is a possible solution to that problem, he acknowledges that the results need be repeated before it's recommended on a wide scale to physicians across the country. But those who scored higher on the test of risk factors had a seven-fold higher chance of developing mild cognitive impairment than those with lower scores. For now, even if doctors identify patients around age 65 who might be at higher risk of developing cognitive impairment, there isn't much they can do to interrupt the process. But they can direct them toward clinical trials of promising new drugs to address Alzheimer's dementia, which may slow the cognitive decline considerably.

"ENLARGE The AirTamer A310 uses negative ions to repel pathogens and recharges through a USB port. Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas The Ache: In cold and flu season, pathogens spread when people are crammed into close quarters, such as airplanes and cars. The Claim: Personal air purifiers worn around the neck clean the air in the wearer's breathing zone of viruses and bacteria as well as allergens, say companies that sell them. The Verdict: The devices helped clear a variety of test particles from the air in lab tests, but scientists say there's no proof they have any health benefit in real conditions. ""It sounds like it worked in a laboratory setting, but that doesn't say anything about whether it works in real life,"" says Darryl C. Zeldin, scientific director of the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences, an arm of the National Institutes of Health. Theoretically it is possible that the devices might help reduce transmission of pathogens, or ease asthma symptoms, but proof is needed, he adds. Personal air purifiers work by emitting electrically charged molecules or atoms called ions, companies say. The ions transfer the charge to particles—such as one carrying a flu virus—in the user's breathing zone and since like-charged particles repel each other, they are pushed out of the breathing zone, companies say. The AirSupply Minimate from Wein Products Inc. in Los Angeles, emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. The AirTamer A310, new last year from Headwaters Inc. in Marblehead, Mass., emits negative ions. It recharges through a USB port and holds the charge for 150 hours of continuous use, says company co-founder Troy Anderson. Both devices have suggested prices of $150. In lab tests funded by Headwaters, the AirTamer was found to efficiently clear cigarette smoke, Mr. Anderson says. In research partly funded by the company, Wein's technology has undergone a battery of testing by University of Cincinnati scientists. In a study, published in the journal Indoor Air in 2005, a prototype of the Minimate was tested for removal of particles, including salt particles in a variety of sizes and a bacterium that doesn't usually cause disease. It cleared the air of half of the test particles after 15 minutes, and nearly all of them within 90 minutes, according to the results. The particles remain present on surfaces, ""but at least you reduce inhalation exposure,"" says study author Sergey A. Grinshpun, a professor of environmental health at the university. Since the particles used in the test were similar to the size of bacteria and particles carrying infectious viruses, it wasn't necessary to use infectious particles in the test, he adds. Dr. Grinshpun's study appears nicely done, but doesn't reflect real-life conditions, says Werner E. Bischoff, an infectious-disease specialist at Wake Forest Baptist Medical Center in Winston-Salem, N.C. In the lab tests, the particles are introduced only once and the purifier is given time to clear them, he adds, but ""if you sit next to a person in an airplane, this person will sneeze and cough during the entire eight-hour flight."" ENLARGE AirSupply Minimate emits positive ions and fits in the palm of the hand. Photo: F. Martin Ramin/The Wall Street Journal, Styling by Anne Cardenas Colds and flus are transmitted not just by air, but also by people touching surfaces, Dr. Bischoff adds. It's always a good idea to avoid touching your nose or mouth after touching the back of an airline seat. The Cincinnati researchers also found the Minimate prototype reduced the concentration of ""viable"" airborne bacteria, defined as bacteria that grow well on a petri dish, Dr. Grinshpun says. It isn't known exactly what causes the inactivation of bacteria, he says. Headwaters's Mr. Anderson and Stanley Weinberg, CEO and chairman of Wein, both say that while it's difficult to test the devices for real-world benefits, customer feedback has been positive. Scientists caution that the antibacterial effect could be caused by a gaseous byproduct of the device, such as ozone, an air pollutant. Both Messrs. Anderson and Weinberg say their devices produce negligible amounts of ozone. Mr. Weinberg adds that the Minimate has also tested negative for hydrogen-peroxide emission. In 2006, a personal air purifier exploded on a Continental Airlines flight, according to a National Transportation Safety Board report. According to the report, the problem was probably caused by the user recharging a non-rechargeable battery; there were no serious injuries. The device, called the Fresh Air Buddy and formerly manufactured by Wein for another company, is no longer made, says Mr. Weinberg. Whether you're allowed to take an air purifier on an airplane depends on the carrier. United Airlines, which now owns Continental, doesn't allow the air purifiers in the cabin based on the results of an ""internal review,"" a spokeswoman says. There is no Federal Aviation Administration restriction on carrying personal air purifiers on board, but each airline can make its own call, an FAA spokeswoman says. —Email aches@wsj.com",0,story_reviews_00655
"(CNN) By the time Cynthia Falardeau read about Alex Pring, a little boy who got a battery-powered robotic arm last summer, she had made peace with her son Wyatt's limb difference. Her premature baby had been born with his right arm tangled in amniotic bands. At a week old, doctors amputated his dead forearm and hand. They were afraid his body would be become infected and he would die. Falardeau mourned her boy's missing arm for years but, in time, embraced her son as he was. Wyatt also learned to adapt. They tried a couple of prosthetics when he was younger and each time the toddler abandoned the false limb within months. ""His main interest was to create a shocking response from onlookers by pulling it off in the grocery store,"" Falardeau wrote on CNN iReport . In truth, she had been more concerned about getting him therapy for his autism-related delays -- the limb difference was secondary. So when a friend shared a story from the ""Today Show"" with Wyatt in mind, about a team of University of Central Florida (UCF) students and graduates that made an electronic arm for 6-year-old Pring using a three-dimensional printer on campus, Falardeau was defensive. ""He doesn't need this,"" she thought. Her fifth-grader had a different reaction: ""I want one of these robot arms!"" Falardeau remembers Wyatt telling her and her husband. ""I could ride a bike! I might even be able to paddle a kayak!"" There were other things the 12-year-old boy said he would do if he had two hands. A proper somersault. Clap with two hands. Dance with a pretty girl with one hand on her back and the other leading. Stuff she hadn't really thought about but he clearly had. Falardeau got in touch with the Orlando students through E-Nable , an online volunteer organization started by Rochester Institute of Technology research scientist Jon Schull to match people who have 3-D printers with children in need of hands and arms. The organization creates and shares bionic arm designs for free download at EnablingTheFuture.org that can be assembled for as little as $20 to $50. Middle and high school student groups and Girl and Boy Scout troops are among those donating their time and materials to assemble limbs for kids and give them to recipients for free. The UCF team, which operates a nonprofit called Limbitless Solutions , is special because it's the only group in the 3-D volunteer network making electronic arms. Most 3-D arms are mechanical, which presents a challenge for children without elbows. With mechanical arms, the child opens and closes their hand by bending their elbow. The students came up with the idea for an electronic arm with a muscle sensor that allows the child to open and close their hand by flexing their bicep. ""It's really just a step-by-step process of solving problems. The first problem we solved was: how do we make the hand move electronically? And then: how do we attach this arm to a child?"" said sophomore Tyler Petresky. ""It's just one problem after another we keep solving. That's what engineering is all about."" The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates about 1,500 babies in the United States are born with upper limb deformities each year. Comprehensive statistics aren't available for the number of children with amputations, such as Wyatt. The UCF project started when Albert Manero, an engineering doctoral student, heard a story on the radio about one of the inventors of the 3-D printed hand. He got involved with E-Nable and met Alex, a local boy teased because of his missing arm, and set about designing a robotic replacement. They gave it to Alex for free. ""My mother taught us that we're supposed to help change the world,"" Manero said at the time. ""We're supposed to help make it better."" The students were blown away by what happened after that. The ""Today Show"" and other national news outlets featured stories about Alex and Manero, and then they got international attention. Families in more than 25 countries have asked the UCF students to help their children. In February, Microsoft highlighted the team in a social media campaign celebrating students using technology to change the world. Each electronic limb takes about 30 to 50 hours to make and assemble. The students use the printer in the school's manufacturing lab and cover the cost of materials -- about $350 -- through donations. Petresky got involved with the design of Pring's hand because Manero knew he was good with electronics. ""He bribed me with some pulled pork sandwiches. I went over to his house and helped him out with electronics,"" he said. ""I found out he was working on an arm, and I thought that was the coolest thing in the world."" Eventually Manero moved to Germany for a Fulbright scholarship and left Petresky in charge of running the operations in Orlando. Petresky says they ask every family about the child's favorite color, superhero and interests, so the new limb can ""not just be a piece of plastic ... but be a part of them."" As they've designed the bionics, they've learned that kids don't necessarily want to blend in. Children have requested colorful designs inspired by superheroes, Disney's ""Frozen,"" and in Wyatt's case, the blue-skinned men from ""Blue Man Group."" For Christmas, the group upgraded Alex's plain vanilla white arm to a new one resembling Optimus Prime from ""Transformers."" ""We quickly found out this is much less about fitting in and feeling normal, and much more about expressing yourself,"" Petresky said. ""There's a large aspect of being artistic and being creative."" The team has made electronic arms for five children and are working with three more kids including Wyatt. He traveled with his mom to UCF last week and practiced flexing his muscle to make the hand open and close. He expects to get fitted with his new arm later this month. His mom, Cynthia, was most excited about seeing Wyatt being celebrated for who he is. ""The adoration of college students was an affirmation that money can't buy. He was wrapped in the joy of leading and advising students on how to help children like himself,"" she wrote in her iReport. ""Wyatt felt like he was making a difference for himself and other children."" As they got ready to leave the campus, her son told her he can't wait to see what he will accomplish with his new arm. And someday, he said, he wants to go to UCF and help other kids like him.",0,story_reviews_00660
"Going for a jog on a treadmill can predict how long you're going to live, a large new study suggests. Researchers from Johns Hopkins Medicine looked at standard treadmill stress test results for more than 58,000 subjects, ages 18 to 96. After age and sex, the two best predictors of whether the patient would be alive in ten years was how highly activated their metabolism was and how fast their heart would beat during the test. Metabolism was calculated using ""metabolic equivalent of tasks"" or METs, a measure of how much energy someone expends during a task. The higher MET level achieved, the more likely it was the subject would last another decade. The closer someone came to reaching their maximum heart rate as they ran, the less likely they were to die within ten years, compared to someone who only reached about 85 percent of their maximum heart rate during the test. Maximum heart rate was determined by subtracting the subject's age from 220, a formula that's been used for decades by exercisers and doctors alike. Dr. Jennifer Ashton, ABC News medical contributor, explained the science behind the test on ""Good Morning America."" ""In medicine we usually base predictions of survival on the absence or presence of a disease state,"" she said. ""What's new here is that there is now a fancy equation doctors can use to compare the chances of survival for one 50-year-old woman against another 50-year-old woman."" Rather than being viewed as morbid, experts should be able to use this information to motivate people to change their behavior, Ashton said. Everyone can improve their survival score by exercising more often and pushing it a little harder when they do, she added. ""This is in your power to change and improve your numbers. You can actually change your own destiny,"" she said.",0,story_reviews_00666
"""Sometimes serious addiction needs to be coaxed down the stairs one at a time, not thrown off the top floor,"" said Dr. Abrams, who was not involved in the study. The study was funded by Pfizer, the drug company that makes Chantix, a treatment that costs about $250 a month. Federal regulators require companies to conduct studies proving the effectiveness of such therapies, and monitor them closely. The practice is common for smoking cessation therapies, said Robert West, director of tobacco studies at University College London, who was among the study's authors. If such studies were funded by the government, which sustains a lot of academic research, taxpayers would bear the burden for what the company would eventually profit from, he said. Still, some researchers not involved in the study said the topic required more work. ""The approach taken here is a very reasonable one that appears to have been successful,"" said Gary A. Giovino, a professor of health behavior at the State University of New York at Buffalo. ""But the findings from one study do not make a fact. We need more studies, funded by someone other than the company that makes the product."" Smoking is the largest cause of preventable death in the United States, killing more than 480,000 Americans a year. The smoking rate has declined substantially since the 1960s, but the pace of decline has slowed in recent years and health experts are trying to figure out how to get more smokers to quit. About 1,500 patients at 61 clinics in the United States and abroad participated in the study. None were willing to quit immediately, but all said they wanted to smoke less and to quit for good within three months. They were randomly assigned to two groups.

"In most patients suffering a potentially devastating stroke triggered by a blood clot, retrieval of the clot with a medical device along with the standard drug therapy restored blood flow to the brain and reduced rates of death and disability, four new clinical trials have demonstrated. The latest research confirms that, compared with patients who get clot-dissolving medicine alone, those who also get the treatment known as intra-arterial intervention are more likely to be discharged from the hospital, and to go home in better shape. Intra-arterial stroke treatment uses either a suction or stenting device to capture and withdraw blood clots lodged in the vessels leading to the brain. The devices are already in use at some comprehensive stroke centers across the United States, and three designs are approved here. But many centers, citing mixed findings on the devices' benefits, have either abandoned or have been reluctant to offer the treatment, which is costly and complex to provide. Insurers also have been skeptical of the procedure's value, and many refuse to pay for it. Advertisement The results of two of the clinical trials were published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine and presented at an international conference on stroke in Nashville. Two more studies described at the meeting offered further confirmation of the clot-retrieval devices' benefits. The new studies were hailed by some as ""game changers"" in stroke care: UCLA stroke specialist Dr. Sidney Starkman said the presentations were greeted with standing ovations among neurologists and neurosurgeons at the conference. At UCLA's Stroke Center, Starkman said, ""we've seen how well it works and have a team and a system that's really ready"" to provide intra-arterial stroke treatment. ""We were enthusiastic all along and wanted to get others to do the same."" The new research is expected to usher in more widespread use of clot-grabbing technologies at stroke centers across the nation. It comes just a year after a three widely cited studies — also published in the New England Journal of Medicine — failed to show benefits for stroke patients who got the additional therapy. Advertisement In the two large studies published Wednesday, researchers showed that more careful selection and speedy treatment of patients who got intra-arterial therapy yielded clearer evidence of the treatment's benefits. In both of the large clinical trials — one conducted in Canada, the United States, South Korea, Ireland and Britain, and the other in Australia and New Zealand — stroke patients needed to arrive at a participating hospital with a portion of their brain still undamaged by the lack of blood flow. Each of the hospitals performed extensive radiological scans to assess the extent of damage to the brain and locate and evaluate the size of the clot. Treatment also had to come quickly. The use of alteplase, a clot-dissolving medication also known as tPA, is limited to otherwise healthy patients who arrive at a hospital within 3 to 4.5 hours of stroke onset. In the Australia/New Zealand study, treatment with a clot-retrieving device had to be initiated within six hours of the onset of stroke symptoms and completed within eight hours. Compared with the 35 stroke patients who got clot-dissolving medicine alone, the 35 who got the two-pronged treatment were nearly twice as likely to regain some neurological function after three days. Imaging results revealed that for those who got both treatments, 100% of the brain tissue initially affected by a clot had blood flowing to it after 24 hours. Among the subjects who only got alteplase, the median level of restored blood flow was 37%. In the other study, involving 238 stroke patients treated with alteplase, 90% of those who were also treated with an intra-arterial device were still alive 90 days later and 53% were considered functionally independent. Among the rest, 81% survived to 90 days and 29% were functionally independent. Both clinical trials were ended early when it became clear that the dual therapy was superior to clot-dissolving medication alone. ""These are overwhelmingly, unequivocally positive numbers,"" said Dr. J Mocco, director of cerebrovascular surgery for Mt. Sinai Health System in New York City. The studies suggest that, on average, for every 2.5 to 4 patients treated with intra-arterial therapy, one could be expected to have an outcome better than they would have had with alteplase alone. ""This is radically better than anything we've had,"" said Mocco, who was not involved with either trial. The studies' ethnically diverse patient population also means the findings are likely to be widely applicable. Advertisement At the same time, Mocco cautioned that few U.S. hospitals — including those with specialized stroke centers — were ready to offer intra-arterial stroke treatment. ""There are a great many centers that will report they have the capability to provide these services,"" he said. ""But there are truthfully relatively few that have put in the effort and expertise to create the comprehensive team-based work flow needed to rapidly evaluate and treat these patients safely and efficiently."" In the United States, three clot-retrieval devices are approved for marketing. Two are designed to capture a clot in a mesh pouch: the Solitaire Flow Restoration stent retriever made by Covidien and the Trevo stent device made by Stryker Corp. The third is the Penumbra thromboaspiration device from Penumbra Inc., which suctions up a blood clot instead. The Canada-led trial was funded in part by the University of Calgary, Alberta Health Services and the Heart and Stroke Foundation of Canada. The Australia/New Zealand trial was paid for by the Australian National Health and Medical Research Council, the Royal Australasian College of Physicians, the Royal Melbourne Hospital Foundation and the Heart Foundation of Australia. Both trials also received financial and infrastructure support from Covidien, the maker of one of the devices. melissa.healy@latimes.com Twitter: @LATMelissaHealy",0,story_reviews_00686
"Whether you're an athlete or a white-collar worker, most Americans have suffered minor to severe knee pain at some point, especially as they age— even everyday wear and tear can damage a healthy set of knees. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), nearly 1 in 2 people may develop symptomatic knee osteoarthritis by the age of 85. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT While there are several types of treatments to help, such as physical therapy, surgery and medications, there are still no guarantees. Essie Jarrett, 54, of Brooklyn, N.Y., has undergone knee surgery nine times to treat her chronic knee pain. ""I had surgery, but the pain, it wasn't getting better, it was getting worse,"" Jarrett told FoxNews.com. ""And no matter what they tried on me, it didn't work. Nothing worked."" Frustrated with living a life in pain, Jarrett turned to Dr. Halland Chen, a knee specialist in New York City, who offered a new non-surgical treatment known as the iovera system. ""The iovera works in a very novel fashion. It actually harnesses the power of focus cold therapy,"" Chen told FoxNews.com. The iovera treatment uses a handheld device with nitrous oxide canisters to freeze short needle probes to negative 126 degrees. Once injected into the skin, the cold therapy kills away targeted sensory nerves around the knee-- which prevents the nerve from sending pain signals. ""Within 15 to 25 minutes we've frozen away the nerve and the patient will know immediately if they have good results,"" Chen said. Chen says he typically sees people with arthritis or those who have had total knee replacements and still struggle with residual pain. The iovera treatment is cleared by the FDA, and is designed to provide temporary pain relief for up to six months after a single session. ""The interesting thing that makes it very safe is one of the reasons why it doesn't last forever— because you're not permanently damaging or killing off the nerves, [the nerves] do regenerate and grow back over time,"" Chen said. Even though the procedure does not correct or cure a patient's knee problem, Chen says it allows them to regain function and mobility so they can get through physical therapy and regain strength. And as for the pain you might feel during the treatment, patient Charles Bradshaw, 39, said it didn't hurt at all. ""No discomfort at all; it's easier than getting a tattoo,"" Bradshaw, who recently received the iovera treatment, told FoxNews.com. For comfort, local anesthesia is applied to the area before treatment. ""It's been three months since I had the treatment, my knee is fine, [and] it doesn't hurt. And I do so much more--so much more. I go out a lot, I play with my grandkids. Everything that I had trouble doing before, I do it now,"" Jarrett said. Most insurance companies do not cover the procedure, and payment can cost around $1,000 per treatment. For more information visit ioverahealth.com.",0,story_reviews_00691
"As a young girl, Rachel Brathen lived with crippling back pain. Born with scoliosis, a curvature of the spine, she was later in a car accident, then a white-water rafting accident that made her back problems worse. ""I had so much pain that I would wake up and reach my arm out to touch my alarm … and something would just snap,"" the 26-year-old who now lives in Aruba said. When she was a teen, doctors recommended surgery to straighten her spine. Both her aunt and grandmother also were diagnosed with scoliosis. Her aunt opted for the back surgery, which helped alleviate pain but also left her with very limited movement in her spine. Then, a friend suggested Brathen try yoga. She decided to try a few classes before undergoing the knife. More than 22 million people practice yoga in the United States, according to the Sporting Goods Manufacturers Association. Many of them practice to improve flexibility and find pain relief, according to the Yoga Journal. But as Dr. Richard Besser, ABC News chief health and medical editor, noted, it's difficult to pin down whether yoga is effective at easing symptoms of those who have back pain. ""There are many types of yoga and so many different causes of back pain,"" he said. Despite the lack of conclusive research, Besser said, there is some recent evidence to suggest that people with chronic low-back pain who do a carefully adapted set of yoga poses may experience less pain and improve their ability to walk and move. Ben Kane In one randomized controlled trial published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, back pain patients who learned yoga had better back function and were better able to manage their pain. Another study in the same journal showed that yoga improved disability from chronic back pain more than exercise or self-care instructions. There is also a close relationship between yoga and stress, so taking yoga might reduce stress and, in turn, provide some relief to someone with a tense, achy back, noted Dr. Amit Sood, professor of medicine at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minnesota. But as good as yoga may be for soothing stress and a sore back, Sood recommended getting medical clearance first and taking it slow and easy to start. That's exactly what Brathen did. She started with gentle, restorative classes that focused on improving the core strength of her middle muscles. Little by little she noticed the pain was less intense and less frequent. She said it took years to move from a slow, meditative practice to more rigorous poses. Today, she is not only nearly pain free, she is able to do advanced moves like handstands and acrobatic arm balances. Brathen said she is so grateful for her yoga practice, she became an instructor. Now she travels the world teaching yoga and sharing her story. She started a social media challenge with the hashtag #yogaeverydamnday that has 1.6 million fans on Instagram. But she said yoga has done more for her than just heal her lower back. ""Yoga helps with a feeling of well-being on so many levels,"" she said.

"Numerous studies in recent years have suggested that vitamins and supplements have no beneficial effect on your health. Some researchers have gone as far as to warn that popping them may be harmful. But the fact is that most of us cannot get the vitamins and minerals we need from food alone, and multivitamins are vital to bridging that gap. According to a study published in the January 2015 edition of the Journal of the American College of Nutrition, roughly 40 percent of adults are deficient in vitamin A, C, D, E, calcium and magnesium. These findings suggest many people may not even have the nutrient levels they need to stave off disease— let alone thrive and live in optimal health. As I see it, everyone needs a multivitamin for disease prevention, and new research agrees. ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT Another study, published in the January 2015 edition of the journal Postgraduate Medicine, suggests that 68,000 cancers per year would be prevented with daily multivitamin use. The study followed only men, but my take is there's no reason to assume this doesn't apply to women as well. In the study, multivitamins lowered cancer risk by 27 percent among men with a history of cancer and by 8 percent among men with no history of the disease. This new study used a randomized, controlled trial design— a method that is considered to be the ""gold standard"" for proof in medical science. I've always recommended targeted vitamin supplementation to my patients because when you boost levels of key nutrients in your body, you give yourself the best chances of preventing cancer, heart disease, dementia and other diseases. While several previous studies failed to prove the benefits of some vitamins, the fact is, many of those studies have been criticized for poor design and are the reason fewer tangible benefits have been proven. At the very least, you should be taking a multivitamin every day. That said, not all multivitamins are created equal— some contain cheaper and less absorbable forms of nutrients, so you won't get their full benefits, and others have ingredients you should be wary of. Here are a few tips for selecting a high-quality multivitamin that will help you look and feel your best: Go for high quality When you look at a typical multivitamin label at the drugstore, you'll see it has about 100 percent of the daily values recommended for a nutrient. The federal government developed these values during World War II to prevent widespread nutrient deficiency— so while that amount should be enough to make sure you have what you need to survive, it won't necessarily be enough for optimal health. In some of the higher-quality supplements, you'll see things like Vitamin B-6 at 2,500 percent of your daily value. That may sound wacky, but keep in mind that 100 percent is just the level for basic survival— and that 2,500 percent is going to give you more of what you actually need to feel good. Look for high-quality brands with these higher doses. Because I know there can be a lot of guesswork when it comes to finding a good multivitamin, I created my own formula specifically designed to provide key nutrients that boost your energy, which is available on my website. Get one that will be absorbed well by your body Some forms of vitamins are better absorbed in your body. When scanning the label, look for B12 as methylcobalamin as opposed to cyanocobalamin, and when it comes to folic acid, look for methyltetrahydrofolate (MTHF) rather than straight folic acid. Both are forms of B9, but MTHF is the form of B9 found in nature. For vitamin A, look for beta carotene and mixed carotenoids, which are derived from plants and are water soluble. And look for vitamin D3 as opposed to D2. Seventy years ago, these two forms of vitamin D were seen as equals, but recent research has shown that D3 is a more potent form of D. Avoid toxic fillers Some vitamin companies use colorants and coatings that may be harmful. These include hydrogenated oils, artificial colors, magnesium stearate and titanium dioxide. Magnesium stearate could even compromise your immunity— a study in the journal Immunology found that stearic acid suppresses T cells, a key part of your immune system. The vitamins you take should enhance your health, so be sure to scan the labels for these cheap additives and steer clear of them.

"LONDON (Reuters) - First results from a human trial of an Ebola vaccine from GlaxoSmithKline show it is safe and generates an immune response, scientists said on Wednesday, but larger trials are needed to see if it protects and if a booster is needed. The vaccine is being developed by the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) and GSK against the Zaire strain of Ebola — the one circulating in West Africa — and the first doses for a larger trial arrived in Liberia last week. That trial is the first of several mid-stage studies planned for West Africa and aims to test GSK's vaccine and one from Merck and NewLink. Johnson & Johnson and Bavarian Nordic have a vaccine in early-stage clinical tests. The early-stage Phase I trial of GSK's vaccine was primarily designed to test safety, but Adrian Hill, who led the work at Oxford's Jenner Institute, said it was ""encouraging"" that the shot also prompted responses from the immune system. ""The safety profile is pretty much as we'd hoped and the immune responses are okay, but not great,"" he told Reuters. The data, published in the New England Journal of Medicine, were from 60 healthy volunteers given the vaccine in Britain between Sept. 17 and Nov. 18 last year. The volunteers got one of three doses - low, medium, or high - and data from 28 days after vaccination showed the shot was safe at these doses, with only mild side effects. ""People typically experienced mild symptoms that lasted for one or maybe two days, such as pain or reddening at the injection site, and occasionally people felt feverish,"" Hill said. However, the antibody response was weaker than was found in a trial of the same Ebola vaccine in macaque monkeys, in which the animals were also found to be protected. Hill said the lower antibody levels, together with a lower response detected in the immune system's T-cells, suggested to him that a booster may well be needed. Jeremy Farrar, director of the Wellcome Trust charity which helped fund the trial, said it provided ""good initial evidence that the GSK vaccine will be safe to use in people"". ""However, we still don't know whether it will provide protection against Ebola infection in a real-world situation,"" he said. ""That's why trials in West Africa of this, and the other vaccines in development, must begin as soon possible.""",0,story_reviews_00699
"(Reuters Health) – - Adding spice – in the form of curcumin supplements – to the daily diets of people with risk factors for heart disease may lower inflammation, a new study suggests. Inflammation is implicated in a wide range of illnesses, from heart disease to cancer and joint pain. In the eight-week trial, researchers found significant reductions in signs of inflammation, such as C-reactive protein and other blood markers. ""Curcumin is the active ingredient of the famous spice turmeric and has a long history of culinary and medicinal use in the Asian countries,"" said the study's senior author Amirhossein Sahebkar. ""Two key effects of curcumin that account for most of the therapeutic effects of this compound are its strong antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties,"" said Sahebkar researcher at the Mashhad University of Medical Sciences in Iran, in an email. These properties of curcumin have been shown in several animal studies, he noted, but there have been relatively few studies in people. So his team designed a randomized controlled clinical trial to see if short-term use of a curcumin supplement could reduce inflammation in people with metabolic syndrome, a cluster of risk factors for heart disease. Having a large waistline, high blood pressure, high blood sugar, low levels of HDL (good) cholesterol and high levels of triglycerides, are among the factors that make up metabolic syndrome. People with three or more of these classic traits are at higher than average risk of developing heart disease or diabetes or both. Inflammation is also emerging as a feature of metabolic syndrome, Sahebkar's team writes in the journal Clinical Nutrition. They set out to see if curcumin supplements could at least roll back that risk factor by enrolling 117 participants who had been diagnosed with metabolic syndrome for their study. Half were given pills containing one gram of curcumin powder, and the other half were given similar looking pills with no curcumin inside. All the participants took the supplements every day for eight weeks. At the beginning of the study and again at the end, the researchers measured levels of three blood markers of inflammation, including C-reactive protein (CRP), which even on its own has been linked with heart disease risk. They found that the people who took curcumin had improved blood levels of all three biomarkers as well as reduced fasting blood sugar and hemoglobin A1c, a measure of long-term blood sugar levels. The comparison group had higher glucose and levels of one of the inflammation markers, and no changes in the other markers. The study team also analyzed data from eight previous studies and confirmed that curcumin had shown a significant reduction of CRP concentrations in a total of 281 patients. ""The findings of our studies, along with clinical findings reported by other groups, indicate the usefulness of daily use of curcumin supplement for the prevention and treatment of several diseases,"" Sahebkar said. The researchers didn't examine the effect of curcumin on any diseases, and it was a fairly brief study, so it's not clear what the long-term implications may be they caution in their report. The study was funded by the Clinical Trial Research Center in Tehran and the Iran National Science Foundation. One of the authors is CEO of Sabinsa Corporation and Sami Labs Ltd, manufacturers of curcumin supplements. Sahebkar said most of the clinical benefits reported for curcumin have been achieved when curcumin was added to a standard drug therapy regimen, and patients should be careful not to replace their prescribed drugs with curcumin without prior consultation with their physician. ""Curcumin is a very safe natural supplement, and there is no severe adverse event associated with its use, even at high doses,"" Sahebkar said. However, owing to limited safety information, pregnant and lactating women should avoid using this supplement, Sahebkar said. ""In addition, patients with malabsorption syndrome, gall bladder problems, gastric ulcer, bleeding problems as well as those who are undergoing surgery, and those who have a history of hypersensitivity to herbal products should be cautious and consult with their physician before taking this supplement,"" Sahebkar said. Sahebkar added that he is often asked about the possibility of using turmeric instead of pure curcumin supplements. ""Whilst turmeric is known to have several medicinal properties, and its regular use in diet is strongly suggested, it cannot be regarded as an equivalent substitution of curcumin,"" he said. Sahebkar said turmeric contains very low quantities of curcumin, usually less than 5 percent, and curcumin has a very low absorption in its raw form, usually less than one percent of raw curcumin is absorbed when taken orally.

"Because of the widespread impact of high blood pressure, researchers are likely to investigate in some depth any simple dietary interventions that could potentially benefit the wider population. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), high blood pressure is either the primary cause of or contributes to more than 1,000 deaths in the United States every day. Researchers have concluded that one glass of beetroot juice a day is enough to significantly reduce blood pressure in people with high blood pressure . They conducted a placebo-controlled trial with dozens of participants. Medical researchers have recently returned to this plant product to investigate its effect on blood pressure and explore opportunities to put it to use in modern medicine and the home management of conditions. Beetroot has been used since the Middle Ages as a treatment for ailments, particularly those relating to the blood and digestion. If you buy something through a link on this page, we may earn a small commission. How this works. High blood pressure is a serious public health concern. It increases the risk of more dangerous health conditions, such as heart attack, stroke, and chronic heart failure. High blood pressure is also a major risk factor for kidney disease. Share on Pinterest Beetroot juice has been investigated for the powerful effect of its nitrate content on blood pressure. Beetroot contains high levels of dietary nitrate (NO3), which the body converts into biologically active nitrite (NO2) and nitric oxide (NO). In the human body, NO relaxes and dilates blood vessels. Other leafy vegetables, such as lettuce and cabbage, also have high levels of the compound. They take it up from the soil through their roots. A meta-analysis of 16 trials was published in The Journal of Nutrition in 2013. The researchers found that ""Inorganic nitrate and beetroot juice supplementation was associated with a significant reduction in systolic blood pressure."" One major trial was carried out at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL) in the United Kingdom and published in the journal Hypertension. The research was funded by the British Heart Foundation. They found the following results: ""This interesting study builds on previous research by this team and finds that a daily glass of beetroot juice can lower blood pressure in people with hypertension - even those whose high blood pressure was not controlled by drug treatment."" Dr. Shannon Amoils, British Heart Foundation, senior research advisor For the trial, Prof. Amrita Ahluwalia of the vascular pharmacology department at QMUL and her colleagues recruited 64 people aged between 18 and 85 years. Half of the participants were taking prescribed medication for high blood pressure but did not reach their target blood pressure, and the rest had been diagnosed with high blood pressure but were not yet taking medication for it. The participants were randomly assigned to one of two groups. One group consumed a 250-milliliter (ml) glass of beetroot juice, and the other group had the same, except their beetroot juice was nitrate-free. The nitrate-free beetroot juice was the basis of the placebo group. All groups consumed the juice daily for 4 weeks. They were also monitored for 2 weeks before and after the study, bringing the total trial period to 8 weeks. The trial was double-blind, which means neither the administering clinicians nor the patients knew whether the beetroot juice they were given was the placebo or the active supplement. During the 4 weeks in which they were taking the juice, patients in the active supplement group, whose beetroot juice contained inorganic nitrate, experienced a reduction in blood pressure of 8/4 millimeters of mercury (mmHg). The first figure is systolic pressure, generated when the heart is pumping, and the second figure is diastolic pressure, created when the heart is relaxing and filling with blood. The 8/4-mmHg reduction brought the blood pressure of many participants back into the normal range. In the 2 weeks after they stopped drinking the juice, their blood pressure returned to the higher levels noted at the start of the study. This is the first study that shows evidence of dietary nitrate supplementation's long-lasting benefit in a group of patients with high blood pressure. Share on Pinterest High blood pressure is a common health issue in the U.S., and beetroot juice acts as a natural aid. The patients in the active supplement group also experienced a 20 percent or so improvement in blood vessel dilation capacity, and their artery stiffness reduced by around 10 percent. Studies show that these changes are linked to a reduced risk of heart disease. There were no changes in blood pressure, blood vessel function, or artery stiffness in the placebo group. The authors note that the reduction achieved in the active supplement group is close to that achieved by medication. The average reduction in blood pressure caused by a single anti-hypertension drug is 9/5 mmHg. The study concludes: ""These findings suggest a role for dietary nitrate as an affordable, readily-available, adjunctive treatment in the management of patients with hypertension."" To put the importance of these findings in context: The authors note that large-scale observational studies show that for every 2 mmHg increase in blood pressure, the risk of death from heart disease goes up 7 percent and the risk of stroke by 10 percent.",0,story_reviews_00710
"When Bariatric Surgery's Benefits Wane, This Procedure Can Help Enlarge this image toggle caption ImageZoo/Corbis ImageZoo/Corbis For most of her life Fran Friedman struggled with compulsive eating. At 59 years old she was 5 foot 2 and weighed 360 pounds. That's when she opted for bariatric surgery. The surgery worked. Friedman, who is now 70 and lives in Los Angeles, lost 175 pounds. ""It was a miracle,"" Friedman says, not to feel hungry. ""It was the first time in my life that I've ever lost a lot of weight and was able to maintain it."" Friedman kept the weight off for almost 10 years. But then to her dismay she started to gain it back. ""I thought I was cured,"" she says. ""I thought I could eat like regular people."" She's not alone, says Dr. Rabindra Watson, Assistant Clinical Professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, Division of Digestive Diseases. About one in three patients regain significant amounts of weight a few years after surgery to reduce the size of the stomach pouch. Bariatric surgery shrinks the stomach to about the size of an egg, so people feel full from eating very little food. The problem is that over the years the stomach stretches, and when that happens, Watson says, ""Patients are able to eat more at one sitting and they feel hungrier more often."" At the same time, hormonal changes that reduce the appetite and take effect immediately after the surgery begin to decline. Watson says we don't know for sure, but it's possible the body begins to adapt to those changes, which is why the weight loss is reversed over time. For Fran Friedman, it meant a 20-pound weight gain and a bout of depression. ""The reality hits,"" she says. ""Do I want to go back to where I was or do I want to maintain this level of quality of life?"" So Friedman opted for a less invasive procedure to make her stomach smaller again. It's called Transoral Outlet Reduction – or TORe for short. It's one of several procedures designed to help people maintain the benefits of bariatric surgery. This procedure involves inserting an endoscope through the mouth into the stomach while the patient is under anesthesia. It costs $8,000 to $13,000 and insurance coverage varies. If the stomach pouch has stretched, new sutures are put in place to once again reduce the size of the stomach. After the surgery, Watson says, patients report feeling fuller and less hungry and they ultimately gain greater control over what they are eating. And research conducted over the past decade suggests it works. There are no significant side effects to the surgery, and patients can return to work the day after they have the procedure. For Friedman, it did the trick. She has lost 30 pounds since her second surgery. And now, she says, with the help of a support group she is recommitted to watching what she eats and how much she exercises. She wants to lose another 20 pounds. And more importantly, she wants to keep the weight off.",0,story_reviews_00712

"Photo Phys Ed Gretchen Reynolds on the science of fitness. Active older people resemble much younger people physiologically, according to a new study of the effects of exercise on aging. The findings suggest that many of our expectations about the inevitability of physical decline with advancing years may be incorrect and that how we age is, to a large degree, up to us. Aging remains a surprisingly mysterious process. A wealth of past scientific research has shown that many bodily and cellular processes change in undesirable ways as we grow older. But science has not been able to establish definitively whether such changes result primarily from the passage of time — in which case they are inevitable for anyone with birthdays — or result at least in part from lifestyle, meaning that they are mutable. This conundrum is particularly true in terms of inactivity. Older people tend to be quite sedentary nowadays, and being sedentary affects health, making it difficult to separate the effects of not moving from those of getting older. In the new study, which was published this week in The Journal of Physiology, scientists at King's College London and the University of Birmingham in England decided to use a different approach. They removed inactivity as a factor in their study of aging by looking at the health of older people who move quite a bit. ""We wanted to understand what happens to the functioning of our bodies as we get older if we take the best-case scenario,"" said Stephen Harridge, senior author of the study and director of the Centre of Human and Aerospace Physiological Sciences at King's College London. To accomplish that goal, the scientists recruited 85 men and 41 women aged between 55 and 79 who bicycle regularly. The volunteers were all serious recreational riders but not competitive athletes. The men had to be able to ride at least 62 miles in six and a half hours and the women 37 miles in five and a half hours, benchmarks typical of a high degree of fitness in older people. The scientists then ran each volunteer through a large array of physical and cognitive tests. The scientists determined each cyclist's endurance capacity, muscular mass and strength, pedaling power, metabolic health, balance, memory function, bone density and reflexes. They also had the volunteers complete the so-called Timed Up and Go test, during which someone stands up from a chair without using his or her arms, briskly walks about 10 feet, turns, walks back and sits down again. The researchers compared the results of cyclists in the study against each other and also against standard benchmarks of supposedly normal aging. If a particular test's numbers were similar among the cyclists of all ages, the researchers considered, then that measure would seem to be more dependent on activity than on age. As it turned out, the cyclists did not show their age. On almost all measures, their physical functioning remained fairly stable across the decades and was much closer to that of young adults than of people their age. As a group, even the oldest cyclists had younger people's levels of balance, reflexes, metabolic health and memory ability. And their Timed Up and Go results were exemplary. Many older people require at least 7 seconds to complete the task, with those requiring 9 or 10 seconds considered to be on the cusp of frailty, Dr. Harridge said. But even the oldest cyclists in this study averaged barely 5 seconds for the walk, which is ""well within the norm reported for healthy young adults,"" the study authors write. Some aspects of aging did, however, prove to be ineluctable. The oldest cyclists had less muscular power and mass than those in their 50s and early 60s and considerably lower overall aerobic capacities. Age does seem to reduce our endurance and strength to some extent, Dr. Harridge said, even if we exercise. But even so, both of those measures were higher among the oldest cyclists than would be considered average among people aged 70 or above. All in all, the numbers suggest that aging is simply different in the active. ""If you gave this dataset to a clinician and asked him to predict the age"" of one of the cyclists based on his or her test results, Dr. Harridge said, ""it would be impossible."" On paper, they all look young. Of course, this study is based on a single snapshot of an unusual group of older adults, Dr. Harridge said. He and his colleagues plan to retest their volunteers in five and 10 years, which will provide better information about the ongoing effects of exercise on aging. But even in advance of those results, said Dr. Harridge, himself almost 50 and an avid cyclist, this study shows that ""being physically active makes your body function on the inside more like a young person's.""",0,story_reviews_00724
"Liz Szabo USA TODAY Becky Herry has tried nearly every drug available for melanoma. A few years ago, that would have been a very short list. Until recently, people with advanced melanoma often died within a year of diagnosis, even with chemotherapy. For the first time, however, patients such as Herry have options. The Food and Drug Administration approved two new melanoma drugs in 2011 — the first new therapy for the disease in more than a decade — and approved two from GlaxoSmithKline on Wednesday. All improve survival by a few months. The FDA also has put a Merck melanoma drug, lambrolizumab, on a fast track to approval by designating it a ""breakthrough"" therapy. Several other drug companies are also working on melanoma therapies. Melanoma research will take center stage at the four-day annual meeting of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, which begins Friday in Chicago.

More time, quality of life No one can claim to have cured melanoma, the most aggressive form of skin cancer, which is diagnosed in 77,000 Americans a year and kills more than 9,400. But after decades of failure, the spate of new drugs is helping more patients than ever before, giving people like Herry more time and better quality of life, Schuchter says. Doctors now dare to hope that giving these new drugs in sequence, or in combination, will help people with melanoma live for years while feeling relatively good. Unlike traditional chemo, which indiscriminately kills growing cells, the new generation of melanoma drugs work in a precise way, based on a better understanding of the specific genes and proteins that drive cancer growth, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation. ""The reason we're seeing these breakthroughs is because we did the basic science research to help us understand how this cancer happens, how it escapes therapy and how it progresses,"" Turnham says. Many of the new drugs aim to remove melanoma's ""cloaking device,"" allowing it to be recognized and killed by the immune system, says Roy Herbst, chief of medical oncology at the Yale Cancer Center. Other drugs — such as the two approved Wednesday, trametinib and dabrafenib — target growth signals within cancer cells. New drugs have fewer side effects Herry has tried two of the newer drugs from Bristol-Myers Squibb: ipilumumab, approved in 2011, and an experimental drug called nivolumab. Although her tumors increased while taking ipilumumab, Herry says a CT scan earlier this year found they had shrunk by half after beginning nivolumab. The most noticeable side effects from nivolumab have been moderate fatigue and vitiligo, a loss of pigment on some areas of her hands and arms, says Herry, 57, from Santa Cruz, Calif. She's been able to continue working as a registered nurse throughout these latest treatments. Older melanoma therapies — including interferon, interleukin-2 and five chemo drugs — caused much more serious side effects, leaving her too sick to work, Herry says. When the new immune therapies work, they often keep cancer at bay for a long time, says Schuchter, who has patients whose cancer has been controlled by ipilumumab for three years. At the cancer meeting, featured presentations include a study by researcher Mario Sznol, of the Yale Cancer Center, who will discuss long-term results of nivolumab. Researcher Stephen Hodi, of Boston's Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, will present the results of combining ipilumumab with an immune-stimulating drug. Doctors from New York's Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center will present research on uveal melanoma, which occurs in the eye, and affects about 1,200 Americans a year. Other studies released in advance of the conference have shown positive results. A small study of 86 melanoma patients combined ipilumumab and nivolumab, allowing some patients to take the drugs sequentially, and others to take them at the same time. In a subgroup of patients who combined the drugs at the highest dose, 53% saw their tumors shrink by 80% or more, says study co-author Jedd Wolchok of New York's Memorial-Sloan Kettering Cancer Center. In a study of 122 patients, a Genentech immunotherapy shrank tumors in 39% of patients whose tumors made lots of a particular protein but only 13% of patients whose tumors lacked this marker. While many of these patients had melanoma, the drug — a manmade antibody to block a protein called PD-L1 — also helped control tumors in the lung, kidney, bladder and other organs, Herbst says. None of the new drugs works for everyone. And none are risk-free. Ipilumumab can cause severe side effects, created when the immune system attacks the body itself, Schuchter says. Vemurafenib, approved in 2011, can cause non-lethal skin cancers. ""Doctors will say, 'There are side effects, but they are manageable,'"" Turnham says. ""Well, 'manageable' can mean something different to patients."" Turnham knew a 19-year-old woman with melanoma who ""woke up bleeding every morning"" because of rashes caused by one of the new drugs, which targets mutations in a gene called MEK. The woman died a year later. Drugs such as ipilumumab can seem like breakthroughs to doctors because they help 15% of patients. Patients with a limited time to live may not be so positive, Turnham says. ""If you are a patient and someone says, 'There is an 85% chance of you spending $120,000 on a drug, and spending four months of your life being sick, with no benefit,' you're not going to be so excited.""",0,story_reviews_00728
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Doctors can use a patient's abdominal CT scans to also check for signs of the bone-weakening disease osteoporosis, according to a new study. The researchers, who published their findings in the Annals of Internal Medicine on Monday, compared patients' CT scans to their dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), which is traditionally used to diagnose osteoporosis. ""What we found is that there is pretty good correlation,"" said the study's lead author Dr. Perry Pickhardt, professor of radiology at the University of Wisconsin School of Medicine and Public Health in Madison. The idea, say the researchers, is doctors can use patients' CT scans that are ordered for another reason - such as looking for tumors - to also check for signs of osteoporosis. That may spare the patients from additional testing and additional costs. In an editorial accompanying the study, however, experts wrote that using CT scans to gauge bone density could lead to some people being incorrectly diagnosed, particularly if people at low risk are tested. In this study, the average age was about 59 years old - six years younger than the age at which the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a government-backed panel, recommends all women begin being screened for osteoporosis. The disease affects over 12 million Americans over 50. The panel also suggests younger women at an increased risk for bone fractures should be screened, but there's no recommendation for men of any age. Despite DXA scans being safe and cost effective, Pickhardt and his colleagues say the test is underused. CT scans, however, are considered overused - with more than 80 million performed in the U.S. during 2011. ‘INCIDENTALOPOROSIS?' For the new study, the researchers analyzed test results from 1,867 patients, who had both types of scans performed within six months of each other over a 10-year period, to see if their CT scans showed osteoporosis as well as the DXAs. Overall, about 23 percent of the people were diagnosed with osteoporosis, about 45 percent were diagnosed with some bone-weakening and about 32 percent were healthy based on their DXAs. The researchers then found that their ability to accurately diagnose those same patients with osteoporosis from a CT scan depended on what threshold for bone density they used. Dr. Sumit Majumdar, who wrote an editorial accompanying the new study, said a lower threshold for bone density would catch most cases of osteoporosis and limit ""incidentaloporosis"" - incorrect osteoporosis diagnoses ""discovered"" while doctors were looking for something else. At the lower threshold, the researchers found 9 percent of those diagnosed with osteoporosis were misdiagnosed. Pickhardt said the screenings would have to target the right groups of people to prevent overdiagnosis. ""Obviously it's something we need to worry about, but if you apply it to a population that's suitable for diagnosis you wouldn't run that risk,"" he said. CT v. DXA Majumdar, a professor of medicine at the University of Alberta in Canada, said CT scans are better tests, but stomach scans don't include the hip - like a DXA would. A DXA can cost a couple hundred dollars, while a CT scan can cost about $500. Both involve radiation. Dr. Beatrice Hull, from the Center for Osteoporosis and Bone Health at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, told Reuters Health that she'd want her patients to have a DXA scan even with a diagnosis from a CT scan. ""I don't think at this point this one test is going to prevent further testing. I think it will identify patients who are at a higher risk and need more testing,"" said Hull, who wasn't involved with the new research.

"En Español By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, April 3, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- A new class of sleep medications appears to help people fall asleep without causing grogginess the next day, researchers say. These new medications -- known as dual orexin receptor antagonists (DORA) -- target a more specific region of the brain than popular sleep drugs such as Ambien and Lunesta, promoting sleep without affecting learning and memory (also called ""cognition""), according to the new research. ""We've shown that these compounds improve sleep at doses that don't impact cognition,"" said Jason Uslaner, lead author of a study published in the April 3 issue of Science Translational Medicine. Uslaner is director of In Vivo Pharmacology at Merck & Co., which funded the study. Merck already has one such drug, suvorexant, under review by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). More than 30 million Americans struggle to get a good night's sleep, and about one-third of these use drugs to help the process, the study authors pointed out. But widely prescribed sleep medications such as Ambien (zolpidem) and Lunesta (eszopiclone) can leave people feeling hung over and inattentive the next day. So much so that the FDA recently cut recommended doses of Ambien and other drugs that contain zolpidem for fear that their use, even the night before, might impair driving or other activities the next day. Lunesta and Ambien affect GABA receptors, which are found throughout the brain and are associated with side effects, including thinking disturbances, and deficits in attention and memory, explained Uslaner. About 15 years ago, scientists discovered chemical messengers known as orexins, which are released by a relatively small brain region known as the lateral hypothalamus. This area of the brain releases orexins during the day to keep us awake and lowers levels at night so we can sleep. The appeal of orexin antagonists, said Dr. Michael Thorpy, director of the Sleep-Wake Disorders Center at Montefiore Medical Center in New York City, is that they ""target a system that's more specific for sleep."" That means, theoretically, fewer side effects and perhaps less of a tendency to be habit forming, Thorpy explained. Uslaner and his colleagues investigated a compound called DORA-22, which has the same mechanism of action as suvorexant, to see how it fared alongside not only Ambien and Lunesta but also diazepam (Valium) in rats and rhesus monkeys. DORA-22 did not lead to the same mental impairments as the other three drugs. Rhesus monkeys and rats performed just as well on memory and attention tasks shortly after being administered DORA-22 as they did on an inactive placebo. In each case, the minimum dose to achieve sleep was compared with the minimum dose that altered memory and thinking. DORA-22 promoted sleep at lower doses than those that impaired mental skills when compared with the ""control"" drugs. This is the first time in years that scientists have targeted a totally different receptor in the quest to combat insomnia, said Dr. Alexandre Abreu, co-director of the UHealth Sleep Center at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. But many questions remain: Do the drugs truly have fewer side effects? Will they be habit forming? And will they change the quality of sleep in any way? Those questions will only be answered with more testing and use in humans, he said. Experts note that findings from animal studies do not always hold up in human trials.

"En Español By Alan Mozes HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, March 25, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- An experimental breath test, designed to quickly identify patients suffering from heart failure simply by analyzing the contents of a single exhaled breath, has demonstrated promise in early trials, a team of researchers says. The investigators stressed that their evaluation is based on a small group of participating patients, and that more extensive research will have to be done to confirm their initial success. But by subjecting a patient's breath to a rigorous but fast analysis of the hundreds of so-called volatile organic compounds contained therein, the study team said it has so far been able to correctly diagnose heart failure among newly hospitalized patients with a 100 percent accuracy. ""Every individual has a breath print that differentiates them from other people, depending on what's going on in their body,"" explained study lead author Dr. Raed Dweik, a staff physician in the department of pulmonary, allergy and critical care medicine with the Respiratory Institute at Cleveland Clinic. ""And that print can tell us a lot about a person, what they've been exposed to and what disease they have,"" he added. ""That's what makes the new field of breath testing so promising, because it is non-intrusive, so there is no risk involved,"" Dweik said. ""And you can do it anywhere, in a clinic, in a hospital, anywhere."" The findings were published March 25 in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The study authors pointed out that the most common reason American patients are admitted to a hospital is when there is a suspicion of heart failure -- a tough-to-treat condition in which the heart's pumping action grows gradually weaker over time. Currently, a diagnosis of heart failure comes from a variety of factors, according to the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute. These include medical history and symptoms, and a physical exam in which a doctor will listen to a patient's heart and lung sounds, and check ankles, feet, legs and abdomen for signs of fluid buildup. Blood tests and an electrocardiogram can help confirm that heart failure exists. In the new study, to gauge how well the noninvasive breath test could identify heart failure, the team collected exhaled breath samples from 41 patients who had been admitted as in-patients to the Cleveland Clinic. Of those, 25 had been admitted with a primary diagnosis of ""acute decompensated heart failure"" while another 16 patients had shown no signs of heart failure but did have other cardiovascular issues. A single breath sample was obtained from each of the patients within 24 hours of admission, as well as from an additional 36 patients with acute decompensated heart failure as an independent point of comparison. Within two hours of collection, all the samples were subject to the breath test analysis, which relied upon ""mass spectrometry"" technology to scan the samples for their molecular and chemical compound content. Some of those compounds had been pegged as potential telltale signs of heart failure. The result: The breath test correctly identified all the patients with heart failure, clearly distinguishing them from those cardiac cases where heart failure was not an issue. Dr. Gregg Fonarow, a professor of cardiology at the University of California, Los Angeles, said that if further research were able to establish its effectiveness, a breath-driven tool for identifying heart failure would be a helpful diagnostic innovation -- but more so in a doctor's office or clinic than in the hospital. ""If it is clear that it is highly reliable and specific and sensitive, then yes, it would be a welcome advance,"" he said. ""But I would say it would be perhaps more helpful for primary care physicians in an outpatient setting, because that is where it's most challenging to identify heart failure. Today a diagnosis in that environment is based on a patient's history and exam, but symptoms for heart failure can easily overlap with a lot of other diagnoses. And the blood work that would be taken in a doctor's office might not come back until the next day, delaying identification,"" he noted. ""So a breath test would be most useful in that kind of challenging situation,"" Fonarow said. ""But in an emergency room, while there are challenges as well, bedside blood tests are much more readily drawn and quickly analyzed so you can often get the results in minutes. So there may be potentially less of a role for a breath test in that kind of setting."" Study author Dweik added that the test is ""theoretically cheap. But of course we're still early in the process of exploring its potential. This study is really a proof of concept. There is much more work that needs to be done to get it to the point where it would become widely available.""

"You might not want to rush into knee surgery. Physical therapy can be just as good for a common injury and at far less cost and risk, the most rigorous study to compare these treatments concludes. Therapy didn't always help and some people wound up having surgery for the problem, called a torn meniscus. But those who stuck with therapy had improved as much six months and one year later as those who had arthroscopic surgery right away, researchers found. ""Both are very good choices. It would be quite reasonable to try physical therapy first because the chances are quite good that you'll do quite well,"" said one study leader, Dr. Jeffrey Katz, a joint specialist at Brigham and Women's Hospital and Harvard Medical School. He was to discuss the study Tuesday at an American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons conference in Chicago. Results were published online by the New England Journal of Medicine. A meniscus is one of the crescent-shaped cartilage discs that cushion the knee. About one-third of people over 50 have a tear in one, and arthritis makes this more likely. Usually the tear doesn't cause symptoms but it can be painful. When that happens, it's tough to tell if the pain is from the tear or the arthritis — or whether surgery is needed or will help. Knee surgery for a torn meniscus is done about half a million times each year in the U.S. The new federally funded study compared surgery with a less drastic option. Researchers at seven major universities and orthopedic surgery centers around the U.S. assigned 351 people with arthritis and meniscus tears to get either surgery or physical therapy. The therapy was nine sessions on average plus exercises to do at home, which experts say is key to success. After six months, both groups had similar rates of functional improvement. Pain scores also were similar. Thirty percent of patients assigned to physical therapy wound up having surgery before the six months was up, often because they felt therapy wasn't helping them. Yet they ended up the same as those who got surgery right away, as well as the rest of the physical therapy group who stuck with it and averted an operation. ""There are patients who would like to get better in a 'fix me' approach"" and surgery may be best for them, said Elena Losina, another study leader from Brigham and Women's Hospital. However, an Australian preventive medicine expert contends that the study's results should change practice. Therapy ""is a reasonable first strategy, with surgery reserved for the minority who don't have improvement,"" Rachelle Buchbinder of Monash University in Melbourne wrote in a commentary in the medical journal. As it is now, ""millions of people are being exposed to potential risks associated with a treatment that may or may not offer specific benefit, and the costs are substantial,"" she wrote. Surgery costs about $5,000, compared with $1,000 to $2,000 for a typical course of physical therapy, Katz said. One study participant — Bob O'Keefe, 68, of suburban Boston — was glad to avoid surgery for his meniscus injury three years ago. ""I felt better within two weeks"" on physical therapy, he said. ""My knee is virtually normal today."" He still does the recommended exercises several times a week. Robert Dvorkin had both treatments for injuries on each knee several years apart. Dvorkin, 56, director of operations at the Coalition for the Homeless in New York City, had surgery followed by physical therapy for a tear in his right knee and said it was months before he felt no pain. Then, several years ago, he hurt his left knee while exercising. ""I had been doing some stretching and doing some push-ups and I just felt it go 'pop.'"" he recalls. ""I was limping. It was extremely painful."" An imaging test showed a less severe tear and a different surgeon recommended physical therapy. Dvorkin said it worked like a charm — he avoided surgery and recovered faster than from his first injury. The treatment involved two to three hour-long sessions a week, including strengthening exercises, balancing and massage. He said the sessions weren't that painful and his knee felt better after each one. ""Within a month I was healed,"" Dvorkin said. ""I was completely back to normal.""",0,story_reviews_00746
"By Barbara Bronson Gray HealthDay Reporter FRIDAY, Feb. 8, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- For people with celiac disease, everyday foods such as bread, pizza crust and muffins are potential enemies. But scientists anticipate that some day a simple pill could help prevent the digestive upsets caused by ingesting the gluten in wheat, rye or barley products. The only current treatment for celiac disease is a gluten-free diet. A new study, however, offers some potential for hope. Researchers have re-engineered a naturally occurring enzyme, kumamolisin-As, to break down gluten in the stomach into much smaller protein pieces, called peptides. They say these are less likely to trigger the autoimmune response that can create a wide range of painful and irritating symptoms. The re-engineered enzyme, named KumaMax, appears to be highly effective, at least in a test tube. It dismantled more than 95 percent of a gluten peptide that is thought to cause celiac disease, according to the study, which was published recently in the Journal of the American Chemical Society. Ideally, the team could develop the enzyme into a food additive such as the gas remedies Beano or Gas-X and offer it without a prescription, said lead study author Justin Siegel, assistant professor of chemistry and biochemistry at the University of California, Davis. But this could take a few years to develop. If the researchers opt to make a prescription drug, the process of clinical trials and obtaining U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval could take a decade or more, he said. An enzyme is a protein that performs a chemical reaction. Proteins are the workhorses in every cell of every living thing, and their function is defined by their shape and structure. In this case, the researchers re-engineered the natural enzyme to recognize the peptide that triggers celiac disease and modified the protein in the laboratory so it would survive the acidic stomach environment. ""We did the engineering to change the genes and sent that into standard microorganisms to create the protein,"" Siegel said. The next step is to show that the enzyme is not toxic and functions as designed in animals. ""It shouldn't be toxic; it's just a protein you're eating,"" Siegel said. How effective might the enzyme be? ""For some people, even flour in the air makes them stop breathing. Some are very sensitive, and in some it just upsets their stomach a little,"" Siegel said. ""For those who are hypersensitive, this probably is not going to solve the problem, but it would allow them to go to dinner, and in case any gluten ended up in their meal, they wouldn't have to worry about it."" ""For those less sensitive, they could pop one before each meal and eat anything they want,"" he added. The process of identifying the precise trigger for a disease or condition and engineering a drug to circumvent the disease-causing process is part of what some call the personalized medicine revolution, Siegel said. ""We can design a small molecule, a pill, that can be specific to an exact target and have few side effects, if any,"" he said. Some experts identified limitations to the research. ""This is the earliest phase, and you now have to show that it actually breaks down the gluten peptides that trigger a response in the stomach at a speed that will protect the human,"" said Dr. Joseph Murray, a professor of medicine in the division of gastroenterology and the department of immunology at the Mayo Clinic, in Rochester, Minn. ""Let's see how it goes with a whole slice of bread."" Murray said that dismantling 95 percent of the protein component that is thought to trigger celiac disease may still not be enough to provide celiac patients protection. ""It will probably be helpful to someone who gets a low-level exposure [to glutens] by accident,"" he said. But celiac disease is a common problem, with about 2 million to 3 million Americans suffering from it. ""People need alternatives, and this is an example of the scientific community taking novel approaches to helping people with celiac disease,"" Murray said.

"By Kathleen Doheny HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, Jan. 28, 2013 (HealthDay News) -- Breast-conserving surgery for early stage breast cancers may result in better survival than mastectomy, according to a new study. For those with early stage breast cancer, ""lumpectomy is just as effective if not more effective than mastectomy,"" said researcher Dr. Shelley Hwang, chief of breast surgery at Duke Cancer Institute in Durham, N.C. ""There are lots of women who think the more [treatment] they do, the better they will do,"" she said. ""This refutes that."" The findings, published online Jan. 28 in the journal Cancer, are especially strong for women over 50 with hormone-sensitive cancers, the researchers found. Earlier research had also concluded that the two procedures are similarly effective, but Hwang's is a more ""real-world"" study. Hwang's team looked at 14 years of data from the California Cancer Registry, following more than 112,000 women with early stage breast cancer (stages 1 or 2) between 1990 and 2004. Ages ranged from 39 to 80. More than half (55 percent) had lumpectomy and radiation, while 45 percent had mastectomy (complete breast removal) alone. Hwang compared lumpectomy and radiation with mastectomy alone, not mastectomy plus radiation. ""We wanted to look at early stage disease, and those patients typically don't get radiation after mastectomy,"" she said. The researchers tracked the women's progress for a median of more than nine years (half followed longer, half less). During that time, more than 31,000 women died, nearly 40 percent of them from breast cancer. The others died of other causes. For the first three years after treatment, those who had a mastectomy had a higher risk of dying from heart disease and other ailments than those who had lumpectomy. This may indicate that the women who underwent lumpectomy were generally healthier, Hwang said. Over the entire follow-up, those who underwent lumpectomy were more likely to survive the breast cancer. ""The group that benefited the most -- who had the biggest difference in breast cancer survival -- were those women over 50 with estrogen-receptor positive disease,"" Hwang said. This means their cancer depends on estrogen to grow. Among those women, the lumpectomy group had a 13 percent lower risk of death from breast cancer and a 19 percent lower risk of death from any cause than those who had a mastectomy. Not all women with early stage breast cancers can have a lumpectomy, Hwang said. In this procedure, just the tumor and some healthy tissue are removed, sparing the rest of the breast. Among the exceptions are those whose cancers are too large, or those who have different cancers in the same breast. The percent of women with early breast cancers choosing a mastectomy has risen recently, after a dip in previous years. Hwang and others suspect that women told they could safely opt for lumpectomy were still afraid to try it. The new research, which was funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, suggests that if a lumpectomy is possible, it may actually increase survival, Hwang said. The findings may reverse the mastectomy trend, said Dr. Laura Kruper, co-director of the breast oncology program at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., who was not involved in the study. The study is scientifically sound in many ways, Kruper said. ""They broke it down by year of diagnosis and by age category,"" she said. ""They looked at socioeconomic status, and they kept it early stage."" Dr. Wendy Woodward, section chief for breast radiation oncology at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, said that for women with early cancers, the study ""clearly reiterates there is no detriment to cancer control in having a lumpectomy and radiation for breast-conserving surgery candidates."" But, Woodward added, ""I am not sure the study convinces us that lumpectomy and radiation is better for breast cancer survival, but it may be."" The study was observational, Hwang stressed. It found a link or association but could not provide cause-and-effect proof that the breast-conserving treatment is more effective than mastectomy in early stage breast cancer. Hwang believes the study does arm women with valuable information. However, ""I don't want women who chose mastectomy to think they did the wrong thing,"" Hwang said. ""At the end of the day, personal preference trumps everything else. I fully support the patient's options to choose the best treatment for themselves.""

"Jan. 4, 2013 -- A new study from Australia may offer a new way of identifying people at risk of glaucoma years before vision loss happens. Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness. But because vision damage often occurs gradually, most people with the eye disease do not realize they have it until a good deal of their sight has been lost. If caught early, though, there are medications and procedures that may help treat glaucoma. In the study, researchers were able to predict who was at increased risk of developing the eye disease with some accuracy by measuring blood vessel thickness in the retinas of study participants using a computer-based imaging tool. Those with the narrowest vessels at the beginning of the study were four times more likely to have developed glaucoma a decade later. Glaucoma a ‘Vision Thief' About 3 million Americans and 60 million people worldwide have glaucoma, and the numbers are projected to rise over the next few decades as the population ages. The disease involves damage to the optic nerve, which relays images from the retina to the brain. Early detection is key, but without regular eye exams, most people don't know they have a problem, says ophthalmologist Andrew Iwach, MD. He is the executive director of the Glaucoma Center of San Francisco and an associate clinical professor of opthalmology at the University of California, San Francisco. ""We call this disease a ‘thief of vision' because most people with it have no idea that they have lost sight until it is too late to bring it back,"" Iwach says.",0,story_reviews_00767
"She is among just a dozen patients with advanced leukemia to have received the experimental treatment, which was developed at the University of Pennsylvania. Similar approaches are also being tried at other centers, including the National Cancer Institute and Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ""Our goal is to have a cure, but we can't say that word,"" said Dr. Carl June, who leads the research team at the University of Pennsylvania. He hopes the new treatment will eventually replace bone-marrow transplantation, an even more arduous, risky and expensive procedure that is now the last hope when other treatments fail in leukemia and related diseases. Three adults with chronic leukemia treated at the University of Pennsylvania have also had complete remissions, with no signs of disease; two of them have been well for more than two years, said Dr. David Porter. Four adults improved but did not have full remissions, and one was treated too recently to evaluate. A child improved and then relapsed. In two adults, the treatment did not work at all. The Pennsylvania researchers were presenting their results on Sunday and Monday in Atlanta at a meeting of the American Society of Hematology. Despite the mixed results, cancer experts not involved with the research say it has tremendous promise, because even in this early phase of testing it has worked in seemingly hopeless cases. ""I think this is a major breakthrough,"" said Dr. Ivan Borrello, a cancer expert and associate professor of medicine at the Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. Dr. John Wagner, the director of pediatric blood and marrow transplantation at the University of Minnesota , called the Pennsylvania results ""phenomenal"" and said they were ""what we've all been working and hoping for but not seeing to this extent."" A major drug company, Novartis , is betting on the Pennsylvania team and has committed $20 million to building a research center on the university's campus to bring the treatment to market. Hervé Hoppenot, the president of Novartis Oncology, called the research ""fantastic"" and said it had the potential — if the early results held up — to revolutionize the treatment of leukemia and related blood cancers. Researchers say the same approach, reprogramming the patient's immune system, may also eventually be used against tumors like breast and prostate cancer . Advertisement Continue reading the main story To perform the treatment, doctors remove millions of the patient's T-cells — a type of white blood cell — and insert new genes that enable the T-cells to kill cancer cells. The technique employs a disabled form of H.I.V. because it is very good at carrying genetic material into T-cells. The new genes program the T-cells to attack B-cells, a normal part of the immune system that turn malignant in leukemia. The altered T-cells — called chimeric antigen receptor cells — are then dripped back into the patient's veins, and if all goes well they multiply and start destroying the cancer. The T-cells home in on a protein called CD-19 that is found on the surface of most B-cells, whether they are healthy or malignant. A sign that the treatment is working is that the patient becomes terribly ill, with raging fevers and chills — a reaction that oncologists call ""shake and bake,"" Dr. June said. Its medical name is cytokine-release syndrome, or cytokine storm, referring to the natural chemicals that pour out of cells in the immune system as they are being activated, causing fevers and other symptoms. The storm can also flood the lungs and cause perilous drops in blood pressure — effects that nearly killed Emma.

But at the 11th hour, a battery of blood tests gave the researchers a clue as to what might help save Emma: her level of one of the cytokines, interleukin-6 or IL-6, had shot up a thousandfold. Doctors had never seen such a spike before and thought it might be what was making her so sick. Dr. June knew that a drug could lower IL-6 — his daughter takes it for rheumatoid arthritis . It had never been used for a crisis like Emma's, but there was little to lose. Her oncologist, Dr. Stephan A. Grupp, ordered the drug. The response, he said, was ""amazing."" Within hours, Emma began to stabilize. She woke up a week later, on May 2, the day she turned 7; the intensive-care staff sang ""Happy Birthday."" Since then, the research team has used the same drug, tocilizumab, in several other patients. In patients with lasting remissions after the treatment, the altered T-cells persist in the bloodstream, though in smaller numbers than when they were fighting the disease. Some patients have had the cells for years. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Michel Sadelain, who conducts similar studies at the Sloan-Kettering Institute, said: ""These T-cells are living drugs. With a pill, you take it, it's eliminated from your body and you have to take it again."" But T-cells, he said, ""could potentially be given only once, maybe only once or twice or three times."" The Pennsylvania researchers said they were surprised to find any big drug company interested in their work, because a new batch of T-cells must be created for each patient — a far cry from the familiar commercial strategy of developing products like Viagra or cholesterol medicines, in which millions of people take the same drug. But Mr. Hoppenot said Novartis was taking a different path with cancer drugs, looking for treatments that would have a big, unmistakable impact on a small number of patients. Such home-run drugs can be approved more quickly and efficiently, he said, with smaller studies than are needed for drugs with less obvious benefits. ""The economic model is totally acceptable,"" Mr. Hoppenot said. But such drugs tend to be extremely expensive. A prime example is the Novartis drug Gleevec, which won rapid approval in 2001 for use against certain types of leukemia and gastrointestinal tumors. It can cost more than $5,000 a month, depending on the dosage. Dr. June said that producing engineered T-cells costs about $20,000 per patient — far less than the cost of a bone-marrow transplant. Scaling up the procedure should make it even less expensive, he said, but he added, ""Our costs do not include any profit margin, facility depreciation costs or other clinical care costs, and other research costs."" The research is still in its early stages, and many questions remain. The researchers are not entirely sure why the treatment works, or why it sometimes fails. One patient had a remission after being treated only twice, and even then the reaction was so delayed that it took the researchers by surprise. For the patients who had no response whatsoever, the team suspects a flawed batch of T-cells. The child who had a temporary remission apparently relapsed because not all of her leukemic cells had the marker that was targeted by the altered T-cells. It is not clear whether a patient's body needs the altered T-cells forever. The cells do have a drawback: they destroy healthy B-cells as well as cancerous ones, leaving patients vulnerable to certain types of infections, so Emma and the other patients need regular treatments with immune globulins to prevent illness. So far, her parents say, Emma seems to have taken it all in stride. She went back to school this year with her second-grade classmates, and though her grades are high and she reads about 50 books a month, she insists impishly that her favorite subjects are lunch and recess. ""It's time for her to be a kid again and get her childhood back,"" Mr. Whitehead said.",0,story_reviews_00774
"Nov. 5, 2012 (Los Angeles) -- An IV infusion of ""good"" HDL cholesterol seems to rapidly remove cholesterol out of plaque-clogged arteries following a heart attack, a small, early study suggests. The goal of the new treatment is to reduce the high risk of a second heart attack in people who have had a heart attack. In the year after a heart attack, about 12% of people have a second heart attack or stroke. And half of them happen in the first month, says researcher Andreas Gille, MD, PhD. Gille is head of clinical and translational science strategy at CSL Limited (which funded the study) in Parkville, Australia. Standard heart attack medications, such as aspirin and anti-clotting drugs, prevent clotting but don't eliminate an underlying factor: cholesterol that has built up on artery walls, he says. HDL removes cholesterol from artery walls, but current HDL-boosting drugs, such as niacin and fibrates, take years to work, according to Gille.",0,story_reviews_00793
"Liz Szabo, USA TODAY A heart disease study presented Sunday is being called a $32 million waste of time — and even a danger to public health — by some of the country's leading health experts. The taxpayer-funded study tested whether a controversial alternative therapy, called chelation, could reduce heart attacks and other cardiovascular problems in people who had already survived a heart attack. Chelation therapy, which can remove metals from the blood, is a risky procedure approved to treat rare, life-threatening cases of heavy metal poisoning. Tens of thousands of patients a year undergo the procedure ""off-label,"" however, paying around $5,000 out-of-pocket, based on the claims of doctors who say it can cure everything from Alzheimer's to autism. National Institutes of Health officials say they launched the study because there has never been any evidence that the practice is effective or safe. In a presentation Sunday, doctors said the trial found a small overall benefit to chelation, mainly because it prevented heart problems in people with diabetes. Elliott Antman, chair of the American Heart Association's Scientific Sessions program committee, praised NIH for doing the study. ""Kudos for funding a trial that says, 'OK, if people are lining up to have this done, let's let it undergo rigorous clinical trials,'"" Antman said in an interview before the results were unveiled. In a statement after the study was presented, Antman, a cardiologist at Boston's Brigham and Women's Hospital and professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, added, ""Intriguing as the results are, they are unexpected and should not be interpreted as an indication to adopt chelation therapy into clinical practice."" Yet some doctors say the study was far from rigorously performed, and so badly run that its marginally positive results are meaningless. Cardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic, one of the USA's most respected heart experts, says he's concerned the study will encourage more patients to get off-label chelation instead of taking proven medications or making lifestyle changes that clearly have been shown to reduce heart disease. ""This study has the potential to be extremely dangerous,"" Nissen says. Chelation ""should not be administered to any patients for the indication of heart disease. ... There are a lot of people, including me, who believe this was a poor use of taxpayer dollars."" At least 30 patients have died from off-label chelation therapy since the 1970s, including an autistic 5-year-old Pennsylvania boy, according to a 2008 report in The Medscape Journal of Medicine. Even the study's lead author says the research should not be used to recommend chelation therapy, and he acknowledges that its findings could have been due to chance. ""A definitive answer on chelation therapy will take much additional research,"" Gervasio Lamas, chief of the Columbia University division of cardiology at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Miami Beach, Fla., said in a statement. ""The most exciting part of this study is that there may be an unexpected signal of benefit. We need to understand whether the signal is true, or whether it occurred by chance."" The trial, known as the Trial to Assess Chelation Therapy, or TACT, has been dogged by accusations of safety and ethical problems from its beginnings 10 years ago. The study was temporarily halted in 2008 because of concerns over ethics and patient safety. An investigation by the federal Office for Human Research Subject Protections, which is charged with protecting patients, found that patients may not have been properly informed of chelation's risks. In response to such concerns, researchers revised their consent forms — the documents that explain a study's risks and benefits to patients — which had failed to mention the risk of death in chelation therapy. Federal officials also ordered researchers to notify patients that the drug they were receiving had never been approved for lead poisoning, as implied in the consent form, and that the Food and Drug Administration had taken the study drug off of its list of approved medications. Stephen Kopecky, a Mayo Clinic cardiologist who participated in the trial, says he's also concerned about the reliability of its findings. The overall benefits were very small, with 26.5% of those randomly assigned to chelation experiencing a cardiovascular problem, compared with 30% of those randomly assigned to a placebo infusion. Even more concerning, that benefit passed the bar for statistical significance — the standard for judging whether a result is real or a fluke — by only 0.001. Further analysis showed the benefits were limited to those with diabetes, rather than for patients overall. Under the best of circumstances, that's not a strong result, says anesthesiologist Kimball Atwood of Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Massachusetts, who has followed the study from its beginning. This study's findings are even more questionable, however, Kopecky says, because patients who got chelation had lower bad cholesterol levels than the placebo group at the start of the trial. That could explain most of their reduced risk for a second heart attack, says Kopecky, president of the American Society for Preventive Cardiology. In addition, 30% of patients stopped getting their assigned treatments, and 17% withdrew their consent, preventing doctors from including their data or even contacting them to see if they were still alive, Kopecky says. That large of a dropout rate — which is normally no more than about 3% — could skew the study's findings, Kopecky says. ""That's a big concern any time a study shows a benefit on something that's not highly regulated by the FDA,"" Kopecky says. Kopecky also acknowledges that there's no known biological basis for why removing metals from the blood would help heart disease. ""That is a million-dollar question,"" he said. More than half the trial sites were led by doctors who practice chelation, says Paul Armstrong, a professor of cardiology at the University of Alberta, chosen to discuss the study on a panel at the heart meeting. That could lead to a bias in favor of chelation, Atwood says. ""All of these factors call into question the results,"" says Michael Carome, deputy director of the advocacy group Public Citizen's Health Research Group. NIH officials say the trial was worthwhile. Gary Gibbons, director of the National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, says the study was a ""breakthrough"" not for proving that chelation works, but for ""establishing that this chelation therapy regimen can be administered in a safe manner in the context of a clinical trial.""",0,story_reviews_00797
"TEL AVIV (Reuters) - Israel-based Neuronix, which has developed a non-invasive medical device to help to treat Alzheimer's disease, expects the system to be approved by the U.S. Food & Drug Administration in late 2014. Neuronix CEO Eyal Baror poses for a photo next to a newly-developed device to treat Alzheimer's disease at Assaf Harofeh Medical Center near Tel Aviv October 24, 2012. REUTERS/Nir Elias The device, which combines electromagnetic stimulation with computer-based cognitive training, is already approved for use in Europe, Israel and several Asian countries such as Singapore. ""You stimulate the brain on a biological level as well as on a cognitive level,"" Neuronix CEO Eyal Baror told Reuters, saying this double approach created longer-lasting benefits. The device, which consists of a chair containing an electronic system and software in the back and a coil placed at the head, has been tested on mild to moderate Alzheimer's patients who suffer from dementia but are not totally dependent. The system is in trials at Harvard Medical School/Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Centre. Patients are treated for one hour a day, five days a week over six weeks. ""We see improvement lasting for 9-12 months and the good thing is that patients can return and undergo treatment again,"" Baror said. ""If out of 10 years the patients have left to live we can keep them at home in a relatively mild state of the disease for three, four, five years, it's a lot."" According to Alvaro Pascual-Leone, director of the hospital's Berenson-Allen Centre for Non-invasive Brain Stimulation, brain stimulation - or transcranial magnetic stimulation - involves a very low current applied to a specific part of the brain and is approved by the FDA for treatment of a variety of ailments and diagnostic applications. ""The application in Alzheimer's disease and in combination with cognitive training is novel,"" Pascual-Leono said in a phone interview from Boston. About 20 percent of patients experience a mild headache but there are no long-term negative effects, he said. Pascual-Leone, who is principal investigator in the Harvard trial, said that of 12 patients in the study, six received the real treatment and all showed cognitive improvement. Their improvement was significantly more than the average seen in patients taking just medication, he said. The study's results will be submitted for publication in the coming weeks and a follow-up study on 30 patients is planned. Neuronix received European approval several months ago and has installations in the UK and Germany. In Israel, a few dozen patients are being treated with the device. The U.S. trials are expected to run till the end of 2013. Neuronix is also running a trial in Israel for pre-Alzheimer's patients. The company expects to sell half a dozen systems in the second half of 2012 and three dozen in 2013. In Israel, the treatment costs $6,000. ""Our target for becoming profitable is in parallel to entering the U.S. market around 2015,"" Baror said. Neuronix has raised $8 million from private individuals as well as in grants from the Israeli Chief Scientist's Office and is exploring options to raise more money in the coming year, including the possibility of going public.",1,story_reviews_00802
"A diet that includes tomatoes could lower the chance of having a stroke. A new study shows that men who had the highest levels of lycopene—an antioxidant found in tomatoes—had fewer strokes than men who had the lowest level of lycopene in their blood. Overall, the risk of strokes was reduced by 55%. The study, based in Finland, will be published in the Oct. 9 issue of the medical journal Neurology. Lycopene is found in the highest concentrations in cooked tomato products like paste, puree and sauce, according to the United States Department of Agriculture's national nutrient database. Cooked tomato sauces have more lycopene than raw tomatoes. Corbis Tomatoes contain lycopene, which a new study shows may decrease stroke risk. Getty Images A cup of ready-to-serve marinara sauce has more than 31,000 micrograms of lycopene while the average raw tomato has about 3,165 micrograms, according to USDA. A slice of fast food pizza has 2,074 micrograms of lycopene. A tablespoon of catsup has 2,146 micrograms of lycopene. Lycopene is also found in watermelon, grapefruit, papaya and mango. There are no government recommendations specific to lycopene consumption, but U.S. dietary guidelines have traditionally recommended Americans consume at least five to nine servings of fruits and vegetables per day. In 2010, the U.S. updated its dietary guidelines, stating Americans should ""increase"" fruit and vegetable intake, noting that at least 2½ cups of fruits and vegetables per day was associated with a reduced risk of heart attacks and strokes. There have also been some studies that suggest lycopene can cut the risk of prostate and other types of cancer. Dr. Rafael Ortiz, director of the Center for Stroke and Neuro-Endovascular Surgery at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York, who wasn't involved in the lycopene study, said it shows ""diet is very important"" for cutting stroke risk along with exercising and not smoking. He said lycopene reduces inflammation and prevents blood clots from forming. The Finnish study involved 1,031 men who were part of a larger study looking at risk factors for the development of cardiovascular disease.

Samples of blood were taken at the study's start and seven years later for most men. The men were followed an average of 12 years. Jouni Karppi, the study's lead author who is affiliated with the University of Eastern Finland's Department of Medicine, said that the main goal of the study was to look at whether other substances such as retinol, or vitamin A, and alpha-tocopherol, a type of vitamin E, impacted stroke rates. They found no association with the levels of vitamin A or E, but instead found men who had the highest level of lycopene in their bodies were 55% less likely to have a stroke than men with the lowest amount of lyocopene. They were 59% less likely to have a type of stroke called an ischemic stroke, the most common type of stroke that is caused by a blood clot. Overall, there were 67 strokes among the 1,031 men in the study. Of those, 50 were ischemic. There were 25 strokes among 258 men who were considered to have the lowest levels of lycopene while there were 11 strokes among men with the highest lycopene levels. The men were divided into four groups by lycopene levels. The study was funded by Lapland Central Hospital in Finland.

"Oct. 8, 2012 -- Men who eat lots of tomatoes and tomato-based products may have a lower risk for stroke, a new study suggests. Tomatoes are rich in the antioxidant lycopene. Men who had the highest levels of lycopene in their blood were 55% less likely to have a stroke, compared with men who had the lowest levels of the antioxidant in their blood. The lowered risk was even greater for strokes caused by blood clots in the brain, called ischemic strokes. These are the most common type of stroke. Men who had the highest lycopene levels were 59% less likely to have this kind of stroke than men with the lowest levels. The findings appear in the Oct. 9, 2012, issue of Neurology. The new study included slightly more than 1,000 men from Finland aged 46 to 65. Researchers measured the level of lycopene in their blood when the study began and followed the men for about 12 years. During that time, 67 men had a stroke. ""This study adds to the evidence that a diet high in fruits and vegetables is associated with a lower risk of stroke,"" says researcher Jouni Karppi, PhD, of the University of Eastern Finland in Kuopio. ""The results support the recommendation that people get more than five servings of fruits and vegetables a day, which would likely lead to a major reduction in the number of strokes worldwide, according to previous research."" Other studies have shown that high lycopene levels may be linked to a reduced risk of certain cancers. Cooked tomatoes tend to have a greater effect on blood levels of lycopene than raw tomatoes or tomato juice. Tomatoes are not the only food that is rich in this antioxidant.

"""But the study offers evidence that targeting beta-amyloid can benefit patients,"" she says. Larger studies in many more patients are needed before the drug will be available, though, she says. The benefit is small and studies have been inconsistent, says researcher Rachelle Doody, MD, head of Alzheimer's disease research at Baylor College of Medicine. Called solanezumab, the drug attaches to a protein called beta-amyloid that builds up and clumps together to form sticky plaques that riddle Alzheimer's patients' brains. The drug is designed to prevent those clumps from forming. Oct. 8, 2012 (Boston) -- An experimental Alzheimer 's treatment slowed memory loss by about one-third in people with mild Alzheimer's , offering hope that the drug can alter the course of the progressive disease. 'Encouraging' Results Maria Carrillo, PhD, a neuroscientist and vice president for medical and scientific relations for the Alzheimer's Association, calls the results ""encouraging"" and says she hopes development will continue. ""While [beta-amyloid] is the leading hypothesis of what causes the disease, that has remained unproven. This study may not have hit on everything, and it is not the home run we wanted, but it is the first time we've seen cognitive benefit with an amyloid treatment,"" she says. The latest results come from a combined analysis of a 1,012-patient study and a 646-patient study, both of which involved people with mild to moderate Alzheimer's disease. When the findings of the two studies were looked at individually, patients given solanezumab for 18 months didn't do better on either a test used to measure patients' symptoms or a measure of how well patients are functioning than patients given a placebo. Combining the two studies to give them more statistical power showed that patients on solanezumab didn't lose their memories as quickly as those on placebo. The results really became clear when the researchers looked only at those patients with mild, early-stage disease. In the analysis, those given solanezumab had a 34% reduction in memory loss and other mental symptoms compared with those on placebo. There was even a hint that the drug helped to slow the decline in functioning. Asked if the 34% improvement in cognitive decline is meaningful to a patient, Carrillo said, ""I have a family member with AD. I would be happy with a sustained cognitive benefit for my mother-in-law."" The only side effect that happened more often in people on solanezumab than patients on placebo was chest pain: 1.1% vs. 0.2%.",0,story_reviews_00816
"-- A new study may reassure some women considering short-term use of hormones to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. Starting low-dose treatment early in menopause made women feel better and did not seem to raise heart risks during the four-year study. However, the research didn't address the risk of breast cancer, perhaps the biggest fear women have about hormones since a landmark study a decade ago. The new one was too small and too short for that. Still, it is the first fresh research in many years on the sometimes confusing effects of hormones on women's health. The advice remains the same: Use hormones only for severe symptoms – not to prevent bone loss or aging-related problems – at the lowest dose for the shortest time possible. ""The benefits outweigh the risks when hormone therapy is used for symptom management with relatively short-term treatment,"" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, preventive medicine chief at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. She was a study leader and will discuss results Wednesday at a conference of the North American Menopause Society in Orlando, Fla. For decades, doctors believed hormone pills helped prevent heart problems and were good for bones and minds. That changed in 2002, when a big federal study was stopped because women taking estrogen-progestin pills had higher rates of cardiovascular disease and cancer. Critics pounced on the study's limitations. Participants were well past menopause – 63 on average – and most were not seeking symptom relief. Many were overweight and smokers, and at higher risk of heart disease to start with. Only one type of pill in one dose was tested. Women who could take estrogen alone – those who had had hysterectomies – did not have the risks that women on the combination hormone pills did. In fact, they had lower rates of breast cancer. These factors led many experts to think some hormones might help certain women, and that the type and dose might matter. The new study tested that. It enrolled about 700 healthy women ages 42 to 58 within three years of menopause. They were given either low-dose estrogen pills (Premarin, made by Wyeth, now part of Pfizer Inc.), a low-dose estrogen skin patch (Climara, made by Bayer), or a placebo. Women on estrogen also received Prometrium, a progesterone that more closely mimics what the body makes. All women received a patch and two types of pills, but some of those were fake treatments and neither they nor their doctors knew who had the real medicine versus placebos until the study ended. That is standard study design to test who is really helped by a medication. The main goal was seeing whether hormones made a difference in hardening of the arteries, a precursor to heart disease, as seen on imaging tests. Other health measures also were tracked. After four years, doctors found: _No effect on blood pressure or artery hardening. _Both types of estrogen reduced hot flashes and improved bone density, mood and sexual health. _Estrogen pills raised good cholesterol and lowered the bad form, but also caused triglycerides (another type of fat in the bloodstream) to rise. _Estrogen patches did not affect cholesterol but improved blood-sugar levels and insulin sensitivity, possibly making them a better choice for overweight women at risk of diabetes. Patches and pills have different effects, said Dr. S. Mitchell Harman, an endocrinologist and director of the Kronos Longevity Research Institute, a Phoenix-based group with no industry ties that paid for the study. Oral estrogen goes straight to the liver, resulting in higher concentrations than when it's absorbed through the skin. That raises blood-clotting factors that might be especially harmful to smokers. But higher estrogen levels also cause the liver to make more HDL, or good cholesterol. So estrogen can have good and bad effects depending on the form, he said. Skin patches account for just 2 percent of hormone use, some studies estimate. Besides Climara, at least one other is on the market – Vivelle-Dot, sold by Novartis and Noven Pharmaceuticals Inc. A generic version is expected in about a year. Dr. Sanjay Asthana, a geriatrician at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, led a separate analysis that found estrogen pills and patches improved depression and anxiety but had no effect on cognition or memory. The National Institute on Aging paid for that study. Women need to realize the new study is much less definitive than the big federal one that found more lung and breast cancer deaths among women on estrogen-progestin pills, said one researcher involved in the earlier work, Dr. Rowan Chlebowski of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center. It would be unwise to try to prevent certain health problems by using a treatment ""that increased the two leading causes of cancer deaths in women,"" he said. Manson agreed that hormones should be used only for severe symptoms. Two study participants found they helped. ""My mood leveled out. I found that I was just generally calmer"" on the estrogen patch, said Kathy Smerko, 60, a nurse practitioner from Phoenix. Dianne Fraser, 56, an accountant from suburban Boston, said the patch eliminated the drenching sweats that woke her in the night. She was able to quit treatment after five years and seldom has problems now. ""It was enough to get me through that crazy period"" right after menopause began, she said. ___ Online: ___",0,story_reviews_00818
"A new, detailed mammography exam catches more cancers while causing fewer false alarms, according to the company that sells it. The downside, some physicians say, is that it costs more and delivers twice as much radiation as traditional mammograms. Tomosynthesis, or three-dimensional mammography, has been available in the U.S. since February from Hologic Inc., Bedford, Mass. In just a few months, radiologists say they are finding cancers they would have missed with the standard exam. Others, though, urge caution. ""We really have to wait for the scientific evidence,"" says Barbara Monsees, who heads the American College of Radiology's breast-imaging commission, adding that the technology looks ""promising."" Many digital mammogram centers are increasingly offering the option of paying a supplement out of pocket for a 3-D image. Standard mammograms miss 5% to 15% of tumors, in part because small ones can be hidden behind tissue. We discuss with Robert Cascella, CEO of Hologic, which manufactures a 3-D mammography machine. Photo: Hologic. A study of some 25,000 women, now under way by an international team of researchers and partially funded by Hologic, is examining whether 3-D mammography finds more cancers. Preliminary results, presented at a scientific meeting in November, showed a 47% increase in cancer detection, but no conclusion can be drawn until the full results are published in a peer-reviewed journal, says Dr. Monsees. The American Cancer Society recommends women get annual mammograms starting at 40 years old. A 3-D mammography machine is similar those used for standard 2-D mammography, but instead of taking just top and side pictures of each breast, the X-ray arm of a 3-D machine moves in an arc and collects detailed data used to create 50 or 60 razor-thin slices for each view. The 3-D scans show what breast tissue looks like at various depths. Radiologists say they can now see tumors that would have been obscured by surrounding tissue. ""I think we're going to find more cancers at an earlier stage"" says Liane Philpotts, chief of breast imaging at Yale School of Medicine in New Haven, Conn., adding that one recent tumor, difficult to see on a standard exam, ""jumped right out at us"" on a 3-D scan. The benefit is particularly noticeable in women with dense breasts, in which tumors can be hard to see, but the 3-D exam produces better results in all women, she says. The new exam will likely save lives by finding cancers earlier and give women ""more options,"" such as skipping chemotherapy or getting a lighter dose, says Laurie Margolies, director of Breast Imaging at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York. Dr. Margolies has briefly consulted for Hologic but has no continuing relationship with the company. In addition to finding more tumors, early experience shows the 3-D exam may reduce anxiety-producing ""recalls,"" in which women are told to return for a diagnostic work-up after the mammogram looks unclear or concerning; recalls are mostly false alarms. In a 7,529-woman study at Yale University, the recall rate of women screened with 3-D and 2-D mammography combined was 6.6%, compared with 11.1% for 2-D alone. The full exam typically includes a standard 2-D view as well as a 3-D one and has a patient under compression for a total of about 48 seconds, compared with 20 for a standard exam, Hologic says. Insurance often doesn't cover the 3-D portion so doctors say you often need to pay about $50 out of pocket. (The 2-D exam is done in part to aid in comparing results with earlier scans, Hologic says.) The combination exam delivers 8.8 milligray of radiation per exam, around double what is given during a standard exam on Hologic 2-D machines, the company says. The double radiation dose could potentially cause cancer in 1 in 1,000 women who get 3-D mammography annually from age 40 until 80 instead of the standard exam, according to the Food and Drug Administration. The more-detailed exam will save lives overall over the 2-D scan if at least 3% more cancers are detected, which appears likely from preliminary data, says Peter Soltani, senior vice president of breast health at Hologic. He adds that small amounts of radiation from mammography have never been proven to cause cancer. Hologic has applied to the FDA for approval to market a technology that would synthesize a 2-D image from detail taken in the 3-D sweep and which physicians say would significantly lower the radiation because you'd only have to take one set of images instead of two. General Electric Co. is also applying to the FDA for permission to market a 3-D mammography machine; the company declined to say when it expects a decision. —Email aches@wsj.com",0,story_reviews_00820
"MONDAY, Oct. 1, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A new anti-clotting drug called apixaban was better than warfarin at preventing stroke in patients with the heart rhythm disorder atrial fibrillation, a new study found. Data from more than 18,000 patients also found that apixaban was safer overall than warfarin, and tended to cause less bleeding in the skull in patients who faced the highest risk of bleeding. The findings suggest that the current risk scoring systems for tailoring anti-clotting (anticoagulant) treatment to individual patients may be less relevant when using apixaban for patients with atrial fibrillation who have at least one risk factor for stroke, according to the Duke University Medical Center researchers. ""The benefits of apixaban are preserved, regardless of the risk score used and regardless of the patient risk category,"" study author and cardiologist Dr. Renato Lopes said in a Duke news release. ""With new oral anticoagulants, such as apixaban, we might not need risk scores to guide treatment decisions for stroke prevention in patients with atrial fibrillation. This may simplify how physicians make decisions and also improve patient care."" Study co-investigator Dr. Jack Ansell agreed. ""This analysis provides further support for the benefit of apixaban, but given the very low risk of bleeding with apixaban, it also suggests that the current stroke and bleeding risk scores may not be sensitive enough to tease out those patients with the very lowest risk of stroke who might benefit from apixaban therapy,"" said Ansell, who is chairman of the department of medicine at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City and a consultant to Bristol-Myers Squibb and Pfizer, the companies that are marketing the drug as Eliquis. The drug has not yet been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration. The study was published online Oct. 1 in The Lancet. Apixaban showed a 21 percent relative reduction in the incidence of strokes or systemic embolisms (clots) when compared to warfarin, a 31 percent relative reduction in major bleeding and an 11 percent relative reduction in overall mortality, the researchers found. Atrial fibrillation affects more than 2.6 million people in the United States. In people with atrial fibrillation, disorganized electrical activity causes ineffective contraction of the upper chambers of the heart. This increases the risk for blood clots that can cause stroke. Current practice guidelines permit the use of either anti-clotting therapy with aspirin or warfarin. Aspirin is less effective than warfarin, but carries a lower risk of bleeding for patients with atrial fibrillation and one risk factor for stroke.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Acupuncture may help relieve chronic back, joint and shoulder pain, according to a new review of the evidence - but some of its benefit is likely due to the ""placebo effect,"" researchers concluded. A patient lies on a bed as he undergoes acupuncture treatment at Beijing's Capital Medical University Traditional Chinese Medicine Hospital April 6, 2010. REUTERS/David Gray In an analysis of 29 studies, they found people who got acupuncture typically reported more pain relief than those who didn't. But patients treated with fake or ""sham"" acupuncture - using retracting needles that don't stick in the skin, for example - estimated their pain at somewhere in between the other two groups, suggesting that they also got some benefit from the procedure. ""A doctor who has a patient in pain has a lot of options,"" such as medications and physical or talk therapy, said lead author Andrew Vickers, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York. ""This provides evidence that they would be justified in considering… acupuncture,"" he told Reuters Health. Acupuncture has been controversial among doctors as a possible treatment for a range of conditions including chronic pain and fibromyalgia. Some think it has potential as an add-on or alternative to standard treatment, while others argue any acupuncture-related benefits are likely the result of hopeful patients getting treatment they strongly believe will help them. That either means many of the three million Americans that get acupuncture every year are ""wasting their time"" - or others who forgo it are missing out on potential benefits, Vickers said. To try to help sort out which is the case, he and his colleagues analyzed 29 studies they deemed to be high-quality comparisons of acupuncture, fake acupuncture and no treatment. Those trials included close to 18,000 patients in the United States and Europe with back and neck pain, shoulder pain, chronic headaches or joint pain due to osteoarthritis. The researchers found that on average, people treated with acupuncture reported a ""modest"" improvement in symptoms compared to those who had sham treatment, and a larger effect compared to untreated patients. They estimated in their Archives of Internal Medicine report that about 50 percent of patients had their symptoms cut in half with acupuncture, compared to almost 43 percent of those treated with sham acupuncture and 30 percent with no acupuncture-like therapy. A typical acupuncture session runs for about $100 and is often not covered by health insurance. USUALLY NOT THE FIRST STEP ""I have a long list of chronic pain patients coming to seek acupuncture,"" said Jongbae Park, head of Asian Medicine & Acupuncture Research at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Medicine. It's usually ""not their first approach to address the condition,"" he said - rather people seek acupuncture when traditional care fails to stop their pain. Park, who was not involved in the new study, said acupuncture focuses on healing the underlying tissue injury that is causing pain, rather than treating the pain itself as medications would. ""I am a biased clinician,"" Park told Reuters Health. But, he added, ""I would sincerely say more than 75 percent of my patients will see improvement."" Vickers said people who are considering acupuncture should first make sure their acupuncturist is appropriately qualified and licensed. In those cases, he said, acupuncture is very safe - and the main downsides are costs and the inconvenience of getting to a clinic.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new study bolsters the case that daily aspirin may help protect against cancer, although the effect seems weaker than previously thought. An aerial view shows an administration building of the German Bayer AG chemical company in Leverkusen wrapped as giant ""Aspirin"" box. And the final chapter on the popular but controversial drug has yet to be written, experts say, because like earlier research the new work has considerable limitations. ""News about the cancer potential of aspirin use has been really encouraging lately,"" said Dr. Michael Thun of the American Cancer Society, who worked on the study. ""Things are moving forward, but it is still a work in progress."" Medical guidelines in the U.S. already urge people to take low doses of aspirin to prevent heart disease if the predicted benefits outweigh the risk of side effects, or if they have already suffered a heart attack. Whether those recommendations should be broadened to include cancer prevention is still up in the air, however. Earlier this year, an analysis of previous clinical trials showed that people on aspirin were less likely to die of cancer than those not on the medication, with a 37-percent drop in cancer deaths observed from five years onwards. The new report, published Friday in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute, is based on real-life observations instead of experiments. It includes a decade's worth of data from more than 100,000 men and women in the U.S., most over 60 and all of them non-smokers. People who said they took daily aspirin - whether ‘baby' or adult strength - had a 16-percent lower risk of dying from cancer than non-users overall, Thun and his colleagues found. For men, the difference came out to 103 fewer cancer deaths a year per 100,000 people; for women, the number was 42. The effect was strongest for gastrointestinal cancers, such as colon cancer and stomach cancer. But it didn't seem to matter whether people had been on aspirin for more or less than five years. Because the study wasn't a clinical trial, it's hard to know if the findings can be chalked up to aspirin or if something else is at play. Still, Thun said the results would favor broadening the aspirin guidelines to include cancer prevention based on an individual risk-benefit assessment. But he added that it will take scientists a few years to mull over all of the existing evidence. LONG-STANDING CONTROVERSY Other researchers are more skeptical. Dr. Kausik Ray of St. George's University of London, who has studied aspirin, said the new study did not look at overall death rates or side effects such as serious stomach bleeds. ""This is not a drug without side effects, so what you have to look at is net benefit,"" he told Reuters Health. Earlier this year, Ray's team published an analysis of previous aspirin trials showing the medication did not prevent deaths from heart disease or cancer, and was likely to cause more harm than good. One of the problems with the new study as well as with previous aspirin trials, he said, is something called detection bias. People who develop stomach bleeding from aspirin are likely to get their bowels checked out by a doctor. As a result, doctors may find and remove tumors or precancerous polyps, which could prolong the patient's life - the idea behind colon cancer screening. So far, most aspirin trials have been designed to test the drug's effect on heart disease. Ray called for trials that specifically check people for new cancers at given intervals to weed out the selection bias marring the previous research. ""I don't think we have enough hard evidence suggesting everybody should be taking"" aspirin, Ray said. When it comes to cancer, the government-backed U.S. Preventive Services Task Force agrees. It discourages the use of aspirin to stave off colorectal cancer in people at average risk for the disease. SOURCE: Journal of the National Cancer Institute, August 10, 2012.",0,story_reviews_00832
"July 30, 2012 -- If it weren't for routine PSA prostate cancer screening, an extra 17,000 Americans each year would learn that they had the worst form of the disease, a new study suggests. That kind of prostate cancer -- metastatic prostate cancer, in which the cancer spreads to the bone or other parts of the body -- is rapidly fatal, usually within two years or less. The new study seems to make a powerful argument in favor of PSA testing. It finds that in the three years before widespread PSA testing (1983-1985), men getting their first diagnosis of prostate cancer were three times more likely to learn they had very late-stage cancer than men diagnosed in the most recent three years for which data is available (2006-2008). ""By not using PSA tests in the vast majority of men, you have to accept you are going to increase very serious metastatic disease threefold,"" says study leader Edward Messing, MD, chief of urology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. In 2008, about 8,000 U.S. men were diagnosed with metastatic prostate cancer. By projecting data from the pre-PSA era forward, Messing calculates that without routine PSA tests, 25,000 men would have been diagnosed in 2008 -- an extra 17,000 cases of deadly disease. But it's not that simple, says Barnett Kramer, MD, MPH, associate director for disease prevention at the National Institutes of Health. Studies looking back at cancer trends in a population are very unreliable when it comes to showing what caused those trends. For example, Kramer says, what if a man got a PSA test when his prostate cancer was in the very earliest stages of metastatic disease? Microscopic cancers already have seeded his body. But he would not yet have symptoms or detectable metastatic disease, so he'd be diagnosed with earlier-stage disease. He's subtracted forever from the men whose first diagnosis was late-stage disease, even though screening could not save his life. Messing says this misses the point of his study, which appears in the online July 30 issue of the journal Cancer.",0,story_reviews_00838
"According to a U.S. government advisory panel, almost no one should get screened for prostate cancer. But a new study this week reflects the continued view of many physicians — that screening does help to catch tumors earlier. To screen or not to screen: here's why experts still can't agree Mike Albans / NY Daily News Archive via Getty Images PSA blood testing at Long Island College Hospital in Brooklyn, N.Y. If you're wondering why experts still can't agree on prostate-cancer screening, you're not alone. Just two months ago, a major U.S. government panel said that basically no one should get screened for prostate cancer, claiming the simple blood test for prostate-specific antigen, or PSA, does more harm than good. Now, a new study looks at government data and finds that, without PSA testing, the U.S. would have three times as many patients each year diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer — and the vast majority of those cases would be fatal. ""Almost all men with clinically apparent metastases at initial diagnosis will die from prostate cancer,"" urologist and study author Edward Messing told reporters, as he explained the importance of his study. The new study reflects a broader divide in the medical community, between public health experts who have largely turned away from PSA screening, and many practicing clinicians who feel the test has helped their patients immensely. (MORE: Men Should Forgo PSA Testing, U.S. Panel Advises) No one denies that PSA tests can help to catch prostate cancer early. But two issues are still unresolved. One is how well screening can actually work to prevent cancer deaths; the other is what kind of negative effects screening brings along with its benefits. On the first issue, there is still some uncertainty. In the U.S., a large randomized trial found no mortality benefit of screening. But an even larger randomized clinical trial in Europe has found a benefit. In its latest results published this spring, the European study team said that men who undergo routine testing have significantly lower risk of prostate-cancer death after 11 years. Still, the real crux of the debate on PSA testing is the second issue: the possible negative effects of screening. No diagnostic test is 100% accurate, and if a PSA test comes back positive for prostate cancer, the patient will usually be referred for a biopsy to confirm the diagnosis. That test can have side effects. Then, if the patient does have cancer, the available treatments for it — surgery, radiation, as well as other options — also have side effects, chief among them impotence, incontinence, and urinary incontinence. The same European trial that found lower cancer mortality with PSA testing also found that, to save just one life through screening, an extra 37 men would need to be diagnosed with prostate cancer and treated. Many health experts think that's too much risky treatment to justify the results. So when the government advisory panel — the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force — recommends against routine PSA testing, it's making a judgment call. It's saying that, for most men, the (albeit small) risk of sexual dysfunction and urinary leakage from eventual treatment is not worth it, given the even smaller chance that PSA testing could save your life. But that decision does remain a judgment call. It depends on how much you value certain quality-of-life measures versus how much you value having any life at all. (MORE: Surgery for Early Prostate Cancer Doesn't Save Lives) As for the new paper this week, which suggests that three times as many men would be diagnosed each year with metastatic prostate cancer if it weren't for PSA testing, that study is published in the journal Cancer — and its numbers deserve a little explanation. To calculate the total number of metastatic cases we'd get without screening, the study takes today's population of the United States and applies the rates (broken down by age and race) of advanced-stage prostate cancer that were observed before PSA testing was introduced — that is, the rates way back in 1983-85. In other words, it tells us what the current U.S. population would look like if today we faced the same risks that Americans faced in the '80s; it finds we'd have roughly 25,000 U.S. men diagnosed with advanced-stage prostate cancer each year compared to just 8,000 today. But is going back in time 30 years really the same thing that we'd get if we abolished PSA testing today? Who knows? The rate of new diagnoses of all cancer types combined has been falling consistently in recent years. However, prostate cancer is one of the few cancers that's not strongly linked to smoking (and falling cigarette consumption over the past 40 years is a major reason for falling cancer rates). It is, however, linked to obesity, which has been on the rise since the 1980s. One further fact to keep in mind is that PSA testing works to cut the number of newly diagnosed advanced-stage cancers — but it does so by increasing the number of cancers that are caught early. And, as the debate over PSA testing shows us, early diagnosis is only useful if early treatment can help patients live longer and healthier lives, preventing progression to advanced-stage cancer down the line, but without increasing the risks of other health problems too much in the process. That's what experts can't agree about. Many doctors do have very strong opinions, though. As a patient, if you're deciding whether to get a PSA test, or whether not to get a PSA test, remember you do have a right to your own opinion too. There's no easy answer.

"Bathing-suit season is here and with it, anxiety over cellulite. A new laser device that burrows under the skin is getting praise from some doctors who say it gives more dramatic and longer-lasting results than previous treatments, but others caution that more research is needed. Cellulite is a dimpled, uneven appearance of skin caused by fat underneath. It affects some 85% of women and about 5% of men. Until recently, the main treatments to battle cellulite have been external treatments such as creams and radio-frequency and massage devices. The creams are largely ineffective and the devices have a modest effect that typically lasts about six months, doctors say. Aches & Claims looks at a new laser that burrows under the skin to treat cellulite. Cellulaze cuts fibers under the skin believed to be part of a major cause of the ugly dimpling phenonenom that affects 85% of women. Leslie Yazel has details on Lunch Break. Photo: Cynosure. A therapy called Cellulaze, which uses a laser machine sold by Cynosure Inc. in Westford, Mass., hit the U.S. market in February. Some doctors say the results are impressive. ""The results are nothing short of remarkable,"" says Los Angeles plastic surgeon Grant Stevens, a clinical professor of surgery at the University of Southern California's Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles. Dr. Stevens, who isn't affiliated with Cynosure, said he and another doctor in his practice together have treated about 40 patients with Cellulaze. The Cellulaze laser machine Cynosure Based on the published scientific data, Cellulaze is ""promising,"" says Mathew M. Avram, director of the Dermatology Laser & Cosmetic Center at Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston. But ""we need more clinical experience before we can make any definitive statements as to the efficacy of the device."" Cellulaze is different from earlier treatments in that it tackles the root causes of cellulite, including thinning skin and connective fibers called septae that are believed to create tension by pulling down the skin, contributing to an uneven appearance, says Gordon H. Sasaki, a clinical professor of plastic surgery at Loma Linda University Medical University Center in Loma Linda, Calif. Dr. Sasaki is a paid consultant to Cynosure. How Cellulaze Works: • Tiny incisions are made so a cannula, or tube, can be inserted into the skin. • Local anesthetic is inserted through the cannula. • Laser light through the cannula cuts septae—which scientists say help cause cellulite dimples. The underside of the skin is heated and some small amounts of fat are melted. • Bruises and tiny scars result, but fade with time. • Compression garments recommended to prevent fluid buildup. Cellulaze is done by plastic surgeons in their offices under local anesthetic. It typically costs $5,000 to $7,000 for a bilateral area, such as the thighs, and another $2,500 or more for each additional area. One or more tiny incisions are made so a narrow tube called a cannula can be inserted into the skin. Laser light, delivered through the cannula, cuts the septae and melts small amounts of fat, Dr. Sasaki says. It heats the underside of the skin, which stimulates collagen production and makes skin thicker and more elastic, he adds. Cellulaze leaves tiny scars—about two millimeters long—which fade with time, surgeons say. Typically, compression garments are recommended for at least two or three weeks to prevent fluid buildup. And there will be bruises, so patients typically need to wait three to six weeks before venturing out in a bathing suit, surgeons say. . Patients typically wait three to six weeks before going out in a bathing suit. Associated Press The procedure can cause a buildup of fluid in the area that has been treated, which can last for months and needs to be drained regularly by a doctor. In a written statement, Cynosure says ""a few"" patients in early trials had the buildups, called seromas, adding that they need to be drained to prevent infections and other complications. The company says it has since lowered the recommended laser dosage and it isn't aware of any seromas since the device hit the U.S. market. According to a company-funded study of 10 women published last year in Aesthetic Surgery Journal, Cellulaze resulted in skin that was 25% thicker after a year. Cellulite reduction was ""good"" to ""excellent"" as graded by physicians. Dr. Sasaki, in data obtained as part of a company-financed trial that has yet to be published, says 80% of 25 patients he treated are still enjoying ""substantial improvement"" two years after the surgery. Lawrence Bass, director of the minimally invasive plastic-surgery program at New York University Langone Medical Center in New York, says the procedure appears to reduce the depth of cellulite dimples. A person with less-pronounced dimples is ""most likely to get a home run"" out of the procedure, says Dr. Bass, who has attended scientific presentations of the data but hasn't performed the procedure. But if you have really deep ones, he adds, ""it might not be enough to make the lifestyle change you want to make, such as wearing shorts in the summertime."" The cannula Cynosure If a deep dimple is still visible, fat can be injected with a syringe later to even it out, Dr. Sasaki says. Another new laser treatment both for cellulite and body contouring is i-Lipo, i-Lipo, from Chromogenex Technologies Ltd., South Wales, England. The laser, which hit the U.S. market in December, is noninvasive and involves pads placed externally on the skin. I-Lipo provokes a chemical reaction that breaks down fat into its components, says company clinical manager Donna Freeman. After the treatment, a cardiovascular workout of 30 to 40 minutes is recommended to burn off the components. The ""Ultra"" model of the device comes with a vacuum-massage device aimed at smoothing cellulite, but the effects on cellulite haven't yet been tested in a clinical trial, the company says. A 34-patient study, unpublished, found eight 20-minute sessions with the device reduced midsection size by 1.8 inches, measured by a tape measure, compared with only a third of an inch for a sham therapy, which looked the same to patients. Dr. Bass says he is ""skeptical"" because measuring-tape data has a large margin of error. Chromogenex says the measurements used scientifically accepted standards. —Email aches@wsj.com",0,story_reviews_00846
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Botox injections may provide some relief from arm tremors caused by multiple sclerosis, according to a small study published Monday. Botulinum toxin type A is sold under different brands, but it's best known by the Allergan brand-name Botox. A sample of Botox is seen at the Long Island Plastic Surgical Group at the Americana Manhasset luxury shopping destination in Manhasset, New York September 30, 2010. REUTERS/Shannon Stapleton Botox gained fame for smoothing aging skin — by blocking nerve signals and relaxing muscles under the skin — but the product has a number of medical uses. In the U.S., Botox is approved to treat conditions like chronic migraine, excessive sweating and certain symptoms of MS: overactive bladder and muscles spasms in the arms. The new study, published in the journal Neurology, tested the effects of Botox injections on MS-related arm tremors, which affect up to two-thirds of people with MS. Researchers found that when they gave injections to 23 patients, the treatment typically eased their tremors and improved their writing ability. Right now, there's no good way to treat MS arm tremors, said Nicholas G. LaRocca, vice-president of healthcare delivery and policy research at the National MS Society. Physical therapy and exercise have been studied, but are usually not very effective, said LaRocca, who was not involved in the new study. Surgery is sometimes used in severe cases, but it's risky and may not even have lasting benefits. ""Exploring new treatments is important, and it's heartening to see there's some promise here,"" LaRocca said of the current findings. But there's still a lot to be learned, he cautioned in an interview. ""This study is fairly preliminary, and it had a small number of patients,"" LaRocca said. Larger studies, of more-diverse groups of MS patients, are needed, he said. The study's lead researcher agreed on the need for more work. ""There are several questions that need to be answered by doing larger and longer-term studies,"" Dr. Anneke van der Walt, a neurologist at Royal Melbourne Hospital in Australia, said in an email. One is how long the benefits of repeat Botox injections might last: this study tested the effects of just one Botox treatment over three months. In real life, the injections would have to be repeated every few months, or possibly every six months for some people, according to van der Walt. Another question is whether the side effects change over time. Muscle weakness was the most common side effect in this study, van der Walt said. It affected 42 percent of the study patients, though it went away within two weeks. Muscle weakness is a potential concern in MS patients, LaRocca noted, since that problem often comes with the disease itself. The study included 23 MS patients with mild to moderate arm tremors. Each patient received a round of Botox injections and a round of placebo injections (containing saline), three months apart. Half of the patients got the Botox first, the other half the placebo. On average, the patients' tremor ""scores"" had gone from a 5 to a 3 six weeks after Botox treatment — which essentially means moving from ""moderate"" to ""mild,"" LaRocca said. Their ability to write and draw a straight line had also improved by week six, and the benefits were still there at week 12. In contrast, there were no improvements after the placebo injections. Larger studies, van der Walt said, should look at whether Botox is more effective for some tremors than others. Tremors limited to the hand and forearm, for instance, might respond better than tremors that also affect the shoulder. If Botox is eventually approved for this MS symptom, LaRocca said it will be important for doctors to get training in how to give the injections — since the drug has to go into carefully chosen locations in the muscle. ""So practitioners will have to be up to speed,"" LaRocca said. There will also be the matter of cost. That will vary from patient to patient, depending on how many injections are needed per treatment. According to van der Walt, the cost could range from $500 to $1,000 Australian dollars, which are roughly equal to U.S. dollars. In the U.S., Botox treatments can cost $455-$575 per injection site. Botox maker Allergan supplied the product for the study, and two of the researchers on the work have financial ties to the company. The study itself was funded by the Box Hill MS Research Fund and the Royal Melbourne Hospital. SOURCE: bit.ly/lUcacJ Neurology, online July 2, 2012.",0,story_reviews_00848
"By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, July 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- Men may one day have a birth-control option other than the condom or vasectomy -- if early research on a new contraceptive gel pans out. Preliminary findings suggest that when applied to the skin, the gel dramatically lowers sperm counts, thus also lowering -- though not eliminating -- the risk for pregnancy. This is the first time that a combination of testosterone and a synthetic progestin called Nestorone has been tested as a gel that could be applied topically. Previous research involved administering the combination by injection or via a patch, said study senior author Dr. Christina Wang, a professor of medicine at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute. The combination contraceptive needs to undergo further testing before it is commercially available. Although men have sometimes received a bad rap for not being willing to assume responsibility for birth control, Dr. Joseph Alukal, an assistant professor of urology at NYU Langone Medical Center, in New York City, thinks this reputation may be somewhat undeserved. ""I think [men] would use it more than is realized,"" said Alukal, who was not involved in the new research. ""Plenty of guys are concerned about unwanted pregnancy, almost as much as women."" Unfortunately, condoms and vasectomy have remained the only commercially available contraception options for men. The results of the study, funded by the U.S. National Institutes of Child Health and Human Development, were presented at the recent Endocrine Society annual meeting, held in Houston. According to Wang, the gel was applied in two spots -- the testosterone component on the arm and the progestin component on the abdomen. The gels were applied every day for six months. The study, conducted in conjunction with the University of Washington, involved 56 men who were assigned to receive one of three types of gels: one gel containing both testosterone plus a gel containing one of two doses of the synthetic progestin; or a gel containing testosterone on its own plus a ""placebo"" gel with no progestin. Up to 89 percent of the men who received the combination formulas saw their sperm concentrations plunge to less than 1 million sperm per milliliter, versus just 23 percent of those receiving only testosterone. Normal sperm concentration is more than 15 million sperm per milliliter, according to the Mayo Clinic's website. Up to 78 percent of men receiving the drug combination in the study saw their concentrations drop to no sperm at all, versus only 23 percent of men taking testosterone alone. The testosterone/progestin combination works by shutting off the hormones that control production of sperm in the testes, Wang explained. One important and unanswered question is what the long-term side effects of this regimen might be. The answer, said Wang, is ""We just don't know."" That's apart from mild-to-moderate acne or an increase in acne, which was seen in about 21 percent of participants. A new formulation currently being developed that contains half the amount of testosterone might decrease or eliminate that problem, Wang speculated. Another question is how reversible this would be in terms of restoring sperm counts, Alukal said. In addition to planning more studies on this combination protocol, Wang is also in early phases of testing the male hormone dimethandrolone, which is more potent than testosterone. Because the new study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"A diet based on healthy carbohydrates—rather than a low-fat or low-carbohydrate diet—offers the best chance of keeping weight off without bringing unwanted side effects, a study published Tuesday in the Journal of the American Medical Association suggests. Study participants following a low-glycemic-index diet, which is similar to a Mediterranean diet and focuses on fish, fruit, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, also saw improved cholesterol levels and other important markers that lower the risks of developing heart disease and diabetes. Such a diet might include minimally processed oatmeal, almonds, brown rice, beans and healthy fats like olive oil, among other foods. The study was led by researchers at the New Balance Foundation Obesity Prevention Center at Boston Children's Hospital and funded by the National Institutes of Health and the New Balance Foundation, which is affiliated with the athletic-shoe maker. It was designed to assess how each of three common diets affects the ability to keep weight off. Participants had all of their food prepared for them, and their food intake was monitored. They ate many meals at the hospital, picking up others to eat at home. Study participants following a low-glycemic index diet, which is similar to Mediterranean diet and focuses on fruit, vegetables, nuts and whole grains, also saw improved cholesterol levels. Reuters David Ludwig, one of the study's authors and the director of the center, explained that most people struggle to keep weight off. Previous studies have shown that weight loss reduces the body's daily energy expenditure—or how many calories the body burns through activity and just by resting—making it easy to regain weight. Dr. Ludwig's study was designed to look at the impact of the three diets on measures of energy expenditure, in addition to assessing hormones, fat levels in the blood and other health markers. The study's 21 participants, 18 to 40 years old, initially lost 10% to 15% of their body weight during a three-month diet that contained about 45% of total calories from carbohydrates, 30% from fat and 25% from protein. A month later, participants were placed on one of three diets for a month: a low-fat diet limiting fats to 20% of total calories; a low-carbohydrate diet modeled on the Atkins diet, limiting carbohydrate intake to 10% of total calories; and a low-glycemic-index diet, which contained 40% of total calories from carbohydrates, 40% from fats and 20% from protein. Participants were then switched to the other two diets during two additional four-week periods. ""The low-fat diet had the worst effect"" on energy expenditure, Dr. Ludwig said. Participants on that diet also had increases in triglycerides, a type of fat, and lower levels of so-called good cholesterol. ""We should avoid severely restricting any major nutrient and focus on the quality of the nutrient,"" he said. Dr. Ludwig said those on the low-carb diet had the biggest boost in total energy expenditure, burning about 300 calories more per day than those on the low-fat diet—about the same as an hour of moderate exercise. But that bump came at a cost: increases in cortisol, a stress hormone, and a measure of inflammation called CRP, which can raise the risk of developing heart disease and diabetes. Those on the low-glycemic-index diet burned about 150 calories a day more than those on the low-fat diet without any negative impacts on cholesterol levels or various hormones, making it the ideal diet, Dr. Ludwig said. The glycemic index measures the impact of carbohydrates on blood-sugar levels. A second study in the same medical journal showed that people in an 18-month weight-loss program that started with monthly meetings lost nearly as much weight as those in a much costlier program of the same duration with group sessions that initially met weekly. That study, led by researchers at the University of Pittsburgh, found that the monthly program cut about $600 off the cost of a $1,360 traditional weight-loss program with the weekly classes.Members of the group taking monthly classes were mailed the same material as those who attended classes weekly, and those who failed to meet weight-loss goals could get individual counseling by phone or in person.

"""Many of us theorize that the two are tied — inflammation causes seizures, and seizures cause inflammation,"" said Orrin Devinsky, director of the Comprehensive Epilepsy Center at the New York University Langone Medical Center and William's doctor. ""Over time, both of them may feed off each other."" About 50 million people worldwide, including more than 2.7 million people in the United States, are struggling with epilepsy in some form. Half of all patients are children. Epilepsy can result from brain injury, but in most cases the cause is unknown and may be genetic. Refractory epilepsy, its intractable form, and the medications with which doctors attempt to treat it can cause lifelong problems with learning, memory and behavior. An epileptic seizure occurs when large groups of neurons in the brain begin firing uncontrollably, disrupting the balance of electrical activity and causing changes in mental function, motor function and behavior. It's not known what sets off a seizure, but lately scientists like Dr. Devinsky have been gathering evidence that inflammation, the immune system's response to injuries or foreign organisms, plays a pivotal role. Scientists have known since the 1950s that inflammation is involved in a particularly vicious brain disorder called Rasmussen's encephalitis, which starts seizures and usually affects children. Inflammation inflicts such severe damage to the brain that the standard treatment for the condition is hemispherectomy — the surgical removal of one of the brain's hemispheres. Some researchers also suspect an inflammatory link to another form of epilepsy, infantile spasms, because children with the disease respond to ACTH, a hormone produced in the pituitary gland with strong anti-inflammatory effects. Eleonora Aronica, a neuropathologist at the University of Amsterdam, has found signs of inflammation in autopsy specimens and surgical resections from patients with a wide range of epilepsies. Annamaria Vezzani, a neuroscientist at the Mario Negri Institute for Pharmacological Research in Milan, has induced epilepsy in mice and rats by injecting kainic acid into their brains, and has observed the activation of a cellular pathway linked to inflammation before and during seizures. The amount of inflammation in the brain correlates with the frequency of seizures, she also has found. ""This is a novel finding,"" Dr. Vezzani said in an interview. ""It was not known that inflammation was a common feature of different types of epilepsy."" Photo Normal brain function is regulated by the glial cells, which protect neurons and induce an inflammatory response if the brain is injured. But this response also can contribute to seizures, some experts believe, either because components of the immune system stimulate neurons or because the glial cells' capacity to regulate the brain is diminished when they become ""distracted"" by an injury. As Dr. Devinsky noted, seizures in turn may produce further inflammation, perpetuating the cycle. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Now Dr. Vezzani and colleagues are testing a molecule called VX-765 that disrupts the inflammatory process she discovered. In one study, high doses of the drug reduced the number of seizures by about two-thirds in mice with treatment-resistant epilepsy. Sixty patients enrolled in a subsequent trial did not experience a statistically significant improvement after taking VX-765 for six weeks, but they did begin to experience fewer seizures at the end of the trial.

""Anti-inflammatory therapies could at least supplement, and perhaps replace, anticonvulsants,"" said Dr. Jacqueline French, a neurologist at the N.Y.U. Comprehensive Epilepsy Center who is leading the new trial. Replacing anticonvulsants is not merely an end in itself. Although they give many epileptics a better quality of life, they do not affect the course of the disease, only its symptoms. Researchers hope that anti-inflammatories may help ameliorate epilepsy's underlying causes. ""Giving a medication that could treat the epilepsy, as opposed to treating the seizure, would be absolutely novel,"" Dr. French said. But there are dangers to this approach. Steroids — potent anti-inflammatories that some doctors are using for experimental treatments — can have harmful long-term side effects. And it remains unclear whether inflammation might be implicated in all forms of epilepsy or which patients might benefit from anti-inflammatory treatment. ""Like any new field, there's a lot of enthusiasm and almost a bit of religion involved,"" said Dr. Tallie Z. Baram, an epilepsy expert at the University of California, Irvine. ""The challenge for the next few years is to find out the limitations, the boundaries, the real mechanisms."" Still, whatever the role of inflammation in epilepsy, Elisa Moller says that anti-inflammatories were a miracle intervention for her son. At William's worst point, a night in July 2010, he had a seizure every time he fell asleep, suffering 23 grand mals between midnight and 6 a.m. Dr. Devinsky had prescribed weekly doses of prednisone, a steroid, and in desperation Ms. Moller decided to administer a mega dose. ""I was taking his life into my hands, I know,"" she said. ""But the way I looked at it, he was going to die anyway."" Since that night William has not had another seizure. He continues with the steroids and also follows the ketogenic diet, a high-fat, low-carbohydrate regimen that has proved beneficial for many with intractable epilepsy.

"May 31, 2012 -- Should people at high risk of heart attack and stroke eat dark chocolate every day? Maybe, according to a new study from Australia. ""Dark chocolate may be a pleasant and effective way of delivering important dietary components that can provide health benefits to the ever increasing numbers of people at increased risk of cardiovascular disease,"" says researcher Christopher M. Reid, PhD, professor of cardiovascular epidemiology and preventive medicine at Monash University in Australia. Reid and his team constructed a mathematical model to predict the long-term health effects of eating dark chocolate daily in high-risk people. They did not study actual people eating actual chocolate. The researchers also computed whether it would be cost-effective to spend money on a public education campaign about dark chocolate's benefits. They found it would be. Several studies have found that dark chocolate, with its heart-healthy flavonols, can lower blood pressure and improve cholesterol. However, Reid believes theirs is the first study to model the long-term effects of eating dark chocolate in reducing cardiovascular risk. The study is published in the journal BMJ.",0,story_reviews_00860
"John Foxx / Getty Images An aspirin a day could keep skin cancer away, according to a new report in the journal Cancer. Researchers in Denmark and the U.S. found that people taking common painkillers like aspirin and ibuprofen were less likely to develop skin cancer — including squamous cell carcinoma and malignant melanoma — especially when they took the drugs for at least seven years or used them at least twice a week. It's not the first study to show a potential anticancer effect of aspirin and other similar painkillers — a class of medications known and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, or NSAIDs. Previous studies have found that aspirin users enjoyed a lower risk of colon cancer; a trial published earlier this year concluded that people who take a daily aspirin have as much as a 46% lower risk of colon, lung and prostate cancers, compared with non-users. In the current trial, researchers looked at all cancer cases in the Danish Cancer Registry from 1991 to 2009 and compared this data against that of a prescription-drug database that recorded patients' histories of using aspirin, NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors, drugs that all work in similar ways to reduce inflammation and dull pain. (MORE: Will an Aspirin Prolong Your Life? It Depends) Overall, 18,532 cases of skin cancer were included in the study. Each case was compared to 10 matched controls who did not develop the disease. Over the study period, people who filled more than two prescriptions for aspirin, NSAIDS or COX-2 inhibitors had a 13% lower risk of melanoma and a 15% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma than those who filled fewer prescriptions, the researchers found. The longer people took the drugs, and the higher the dose, the greater the anticancer benefit. Longer, higher-intensity use, for example, led to a 46% lower risk of melanoma, a 35% lower risk of squamous cell carcinoma and a 17% lower risk of basal cell carcinoma, the most common form of skin cancer in the U.S. The relationship held even after the researchers adjusted for potential confounders that could affect the risk of skin cancer, such as use of other medications. However, the researchers didn't have information on other key skin cancer risk factors like exposure to UV radiation. The drugs are thought to counter cancer growth by suppressing inflammatory pathways and stimulating tumors' ability to expand and develop blood supplies. ""Given the high skin cancer incidence and the widespread and frequent use of NSAIDs, a preventive effect of these agents may have important public health implications,"" the authors, led by Sigrun Alba Johannesdottir from Aarhus University Hospital in Denmark, wrote. (MORE: Aspirin, a Wonder Drug? Studies Show It May Prevent Cancer) In the U.S., skin cancer is the most common form of cancer diagnosed, affecting more than 2 million people each year. But taking aspirin and aspirin-like drugs isn't without consequences: they may have harmful side effects on the stomach and digestive tract, causing bleeding and dangerous ulcers. (One COX-2 inhibitor, Vioxx, was voluntarily pulled from the market by its maker in 2004 after it was linked to an increased risk of heart disease.) But given the growing body of data linking aspirin use to lower cancer risk, the researchers say it may be worth factoring in the drugs' anticancer effects when patients and doctors discuss options for pain relievers. ""We hope that the potential cancer-protective effect of NSAIDs will inspire more research on skin cancer prevention,"" Johannesdottir said in a statement. ""Also, this potential cancer-protective effect should be taken into account when discussing benefits and harms of NSAID use."" Alice Park is a writer at TIME. Find her on Twitter at @aliceparkny.

"May 14, 2012 -- Acupuncture may allow people with the lung disease COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) to breathe a bit easier. COPD is the umbrella term for chronic lung diseases, including chronic bronchitis and emphysema. It is often marked by a chronic cough and shortness of breath. Treatment typically involves the use of inhaled steroids and bronchodilators to open airways and make breathing easier. In a new study of 68 people with COPD, some got acupuncture, along with their daily medication, for three months. Others got a sham acupuncture treatment, in which the needles did not enter their skin. Those who received acupuncture along with their daily medication for three months were able to walk longer without becoming breathless, compared to those who got the sham acupuncture treatment. The study appears online in the Archives of Internal Medicine. People who received real acupuncture also showed improvements in their quality of life and ability to exercise, according to researchers from Kyoto University and Meiji University of Integrative Medicine in Kyoto, Japan. Many people with COPD have problems getting optimal nutrition because of their condition. The study showed that acupuncture may improve stomach function, making it easier for people with COPD to eat a healthy diet and maintain a normal weight.",0,story_reviews_00867
"A new method for performing a ""virtual"" colonoscopy that requires less unpleasant preparation was shown in a new study to accurately detect larger precancerous polyps—and was a better experience for patients. The second-leading cause of cancer deaths in the U.S. after lung cancer, colon cancer can be prevented if precancerous polyps—known as adenomas—are found and removed during a colonoscopy. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, if everyone 50 or older were regularly screened, as many as 60% of deaths could be avoided. But Dr. Michael Zalis, a radiologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, tells the Health Blog that many people may avoid this procedure because the preparation, which requires patients to cleanse their colons with a laxative, is so unpleasant. In addition, some patients fear the instrument used in the procedure, or have concerns about the risks from anesthesia or of perforation of the bowel. ""No one should be dying from colon cancer, which is almost completely preventable with screening; and if it were sufficiently easy more people would do it,"" says Zalis, lead author of the study published Monday in the Annals of Internal Medicine. In recent years, the use of computed tomographic colonography—known as CT or ""virtual"" colonoscopy—has eliminated the need for the most invasive part of the procedure. But though these virtual scans are performed externally, patients still have to take the laxatives so the scanning machines can read the empty colon. So, the researchers developed a software program to electronically ""cleanse"" the bowel, Zalis says. Prior to a scan, researchers asked patients to adhere to a low-fiber diet for a few days and drink a special fluid to ""tag"" the colon's contents. After performing the CT scan, the software electronically identified polyps. The researchers screened 605 patients with the laxative-free CT scan and followed up with traditional colonoscopy to find out how successfully the virtual method detected precancerous polyps of six millimeters or more. The laxative-free scan accurately identified 91% of patients with polyps of 10 mm or larger -- those at highest risk of becoming cancerous -- but was less accurate for smaller lesions, the study says. Dr. James Aisenberg, a gastroenterologist and clinical professor of medicine at Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York, agrees that, for some people, the laxative requirement can be a barrier to colorectal screening. However, like virtual colonoscopy in general, laxative-free CTC ""will miss a subset of precancerous polyps and thus is unlikely to become the gold standard for colorectal-cancer prevention,"" says Dr. Aisenberg, who wasn't involved with the study. However, the laxative-free method ""may become a useful alternative for persons who won't otherwise undergo screening, and is much better than no screening at all."" Dr. Zalis and some of his co-investigators developed the software. The American Cancer Society, the National Institutes of Health and General Electric Co.'s health-care unit—which markets scanning devices and accessories—supported the researchers. Dr. Zalis says the company had no influence on the study.",0,story_reviews_00868

"By Kathleen Doheny HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, April 2, 2012 (HealthDay News) -- A vaccine to prevent breast cancer's return in women with a history of the disease has triggered the desired immune response in early research. The vaccine under development is aimed at preventing recurrence in women who have a form of tumor known as HER2-positive, according to researcher Dr. Diane Hale, a research resident in general surgery at Brooke Army Medical Center at Fort Sam Houston, in San Antonio. She is set to present results of the study on Monday at the annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research in Chicago. The vaccine, known as the ""HER2-based peptide vaccine AE37,"" is designed to harness the power of the patient's immune system, based on its reaction to a cancer-linked peptide (protein). ""The theory is that once you form that [immune] response to the specific peptide, if the body has a recurrence, it will recognize that cancer as a bad thing, a foreign thing,"" Hale explained in an association news release. The study is a phase 2 study, meant to evaluate the vaccine's effectiveness and any side effects. Phase 3 studies are needed before the vaccine could be approved. The science is early, Hale stressed, and it will take at least five years before the vaccine could conceivably be available if ongoing studies bear out. HER2-positive breast cancer tests positive for a protein known as human epidermal growth factor receptor 2, or HER2, which promotes the tumor cell growth. About one of every five breast cancers involves cancer cells that churn out an excess of HER2 due to a genetic mutation. HER2-positive breast cancers are often more aggressive than other types, according to the American Cancer Society. The goal of the vaccine, Hale said, is to educate the body to respond to that HER2-based peptide, so it will recognize the cancer when it recurs and attack it. ""If your immune system has been educated by the vaccine to recognize the tumor cells, we think it will allow the immune system to take care of any individual [cancer] cells trying to set up shop,"" explained Dr. Elizabeth Mittendorf, a surgical oncologist at the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. She is the principal investigator on the trial. The study involved 217 breast cancer survivors who had gone through their treatment and were free of disease at the start of the trial. The women were randomly assigned to receive either the vaccine paired with an immune stimulant, or the immune stimulant alone. The women received monthly injections for six months. The researchers then conducted a variety of tests to gauge each woman's immune system response. The investigators found that in the vaccinated group, 86 percent of patients showed a significant response, compared with 27 percent of those in the ""control"" group who did not get the injection. How to explain the 27 percent who responded without the vaccine? ""For the controls, even without having their immune systems 'educated' towards HER2 specifically, they may still mount a response because they have previously seen HER2 within their own cancer,"" Hale said. Those who were vaccinated also displayed a decrease in certain cells that suppress the immune system. That is a good thing, Hale said, because ""an increase in these cells has been found to be associated with [cancer] recurrence."" Don Diamond, director of translational vaccine research and a professor of virology at the City of Hope Comprehensive Cancer Center in Duarte, Calif., reviewed the findings and said, ""Their approach is well thought out and makes sense."" Still, the study remains very preliminary, he cautioned. ""Whether it actually has an increase in survival remains to be seen,"" he said. That study will be done, Hale said, and they plan to follow the women for three years and look at survival differences. But until the vaccine is linked to an actual survival benefit or improvement in tumor status, Diamond said, no one can say if it helps the patients in a meaningful way. Numerous vaccines to prevent breast cancer recurrence are currently under study, he noted. Findings presented at medical meetings are typically considered preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"Bypass Surgery Edges Stents For Heart Treatment The debate over coronary bypass surgery versus stenting goes back decades. Studies have been inconclusive, but doctors and patients have voted with their feet in favor of the less-invasive procedure — clearing clogged arteries and propping them open with tiny scaffolds called stents. U.S. doctors do at least two stenting procedures these days for every coronary bypass operation. Now the biggest collection of cases so far comes out in favor of surgery on the all-important question of mortality. Four years after the procedure, patients over 65 who had coronary artery bypass surgeries (called CABG or ""cabbages"") were almost 20 percent less likely to die. Put another way, 21 percent of stented patients had died after four years compared with 16 percent of surgery patients. Is that a big difference? Well, the study's lead author tells Shots that it might be enough to ""tip the balance a little bit, but not overwhelmingly so."" The National Heart, Lung and Blood Institute, which funded the study with new ""stimulus"" money from the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act, is more bullish on the implications. ""We would hope a study as powerful as this one will inform decision-makers to rethink the direction they're going in,"" the NHLBI's Dr. Michael Lauer told Shots. He says it's been worrying that so many doctors have been opting for stenting over surgery. Study author Dr. William Weintraub, chief of cardiology at Christiana Care Health System in Newark, Del., is presenting the data at the annual meeting of the American College of Cardiology in Chicago. The study also appears online in the New England Journal of Medicine. It draws on data from more than 86,000 patients across the nation who underwent CABG operations and nearly 104,000 patients who had coronary stenting. They had blockages in either two or three coronary arteries but did not require emergency procedures. Although the pro-surgery outcome is not a game-changer, Weintraub says it might cause some doctors and patients to consider surgery. And he says it supports those who now opt for CABGs. ""It's a very big deal to recommend coronary surgery to patients,"" Weintraub says. ""I think doctors work very hard to weigh what's best for their patients. When doctors recommend surgery, these data suggest that that decision is a good one."" But Dr. Laura Mauri says in an accompanying editorial that the new study can't settle any debates. Only studies that randomly assign comparable patients to surgery or stenting can do that. Mauri is an interventional cardiologist – i.e., a specialist who does coronary stenting – at Brigham and Women's Hospital inBoston. Weintraub notes it's ""very difficult and expensive"" to do randomized studies on this question – and to make the comparison groups truly comparable. And while such a study is being done, the technology (especially stenting technology) changes. That can call into question the ultimate relevance of the findings. So the new data may be the best that doctors and patients in this situation can expect for the foreseeable future.",0,story_reviews_00892
"When roasted at 475 degrees, coffee beans are sometimes described as rich and full-bodied. But for the full-bodied person who is not so rich, unroasted coffee beans — green as the day they were picked — may hold the key to cheap and effective weight loss, new research suggests. In a study presented Tuesday at the American Chemical Society's spring national meeting in San Diego, 16 overweight young adults took, by turns, a low dose of green coffee bean extract, a high dose of the supplement, and a placebo. Though the study was small, the results were striking: Subjects lost an average of 17.5 pounds in 22 weeks and reduced their overall body weight by 10.5%. If green coffee extract were a medication seeking approval from the Food and Drug Administration, these results would make it a viable candidate — more than 35% of subjects lost more than 5% of their body weight, and weight loss appeared to be greater while subjects were taking the pills than when they were on the placebo. But as a dietary supplement, green coffee extract does not require the FDA's blessing. In fact, it is already available as a naturopathic medicine and antioxidant. Advertisement Joe Vinson, the University of Scranton chemist who conducted the pilot study, said the findings should pave the way for more rigorous research on coffee bean extract's effects. A larger trial involving 60 people is being planned. Vinson, whose research focuses on plant polyphenols and their effects on human health, said it appears that green coffee bean extract may work by reducing the absorption of fat and glucose in the gut; it may also reduce insulin levels, which would improve metabolic function. There were no signs of ill effects on any subjects, Vinson reported Tuesday. The study used a ""cross-over"" design, which allowed each subject to serve as his or her own comparison group. For six weeks, volunteers swallowed capsules three times a day, ingesting either 700 or 1,050 milligrams of green coffee extract a day or taking a placebo. After a two-week break, they moved, round-robin style, to another arm of the trial. Subjects did not change their calorie intake over the course of the trial. But the more extract they consumed, the more weight and fat they lost. Altogether, they reduced their body fat by 16%, on average. Advertisement Of the 16 volunteers, six wound up with a body mass index in the healthful range. One downside is that the extract is ""extremely bitter."" It would be difficult to take without a lot of water, Vinson reported. At roughly $20 per month, however, green coffee extract is much less expensive than any of the weight-loss medications available over the counter or by prescription. The trial was conducted in India and paid for by Applied Food Sciences Inc. of Austin, Tex., a manufacturer of green coffee bean extract. The pilot study drew strong cautions from several scientists who weren't involved in the research. ""This is certainly a provocative study,"" said Dr. Gerald Weissmann, a physician and biochemist at New York University. But he said nutrition experts would want assurances that green coffee beans do not cause ""malabsorption"" within the human gut — a condition that would lead to weight loss as well as malnutrition, heart arrhythmias and other problems because vitamins and minerals are not passing through the intestine. Dr. Arthur Grollman, a pharmacologist at the State University of New York at Stony Brook, said coffee beans contain about 250 different chemicals — some with positive and others with negative effects on human health. Though Vinson identified polyphenols and chlorogenic acid as the agents that appear to promote weight loss, Grollman said that claim needed further study. In the meantime, he said, consuming an extract that contains both good and bad chemicals in dense concentration seems an unwise thing to do. melissa.healy@latimes.com",0,story_reviews_00893
"March 19, 2012 (San Diego) -- Ultrasound treatment can reduce excessive sweating in the underarms by nearly 80%, according to a new study.

"They don't call it ""The Big C"" for nothing. People don't even like to say the word out loud. The good news, we're told, is that there are many things we can do – or not do – in our adult lives to lower our risk of developing different types of cancer. Want to avoid lung cancer? Don't smoke. Want to lower your risk of skin cancer? Stay out of the sun, or utilize a proper sunscreen. But a new study published Monday in Cancer suggests that at least one decision our parents make FOR us may have an impact on our predisposition to certain types of cancer. Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine and the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center looked at the association between circumcision and the prevalence of prostate cancer. They concluded that circumcision before first sexual intercourse is associated with a 15% reduction in the relative risk of developing prostate cancer. It's important to note, right off the bat, that this study is not purporting to establish a cause and effect relationship. As is often the case, there are many additional factors at play. First, a bit of background. It has long been established that men who are uncircumcised are more prone to contracting sexually transmitted infections. As the study's authors point out, ""The mechanism(s) by which circumcision reduced acquisition of an STI [sexually transmitted infection] is thought to be related to the microenvironment of the thin, lightly keratinized mucosal lining of the inner foreskin."" This tissue is subject to small tears that allow potential access of pathogens into the bloodstream. Furthermore, ""The moist environment under the preputial skin may help pathogens survive for extended periods prior to direct infection."" Circumcision, of course, removes this protective environment. Why is this important? Infections are reported to cause almost 20% of cancers worldwide, either directly by infection, or indirectly via inflammation. Several STIs – such as gonorrhea, Chlamydia, HPV & HIV – have been found in the prostate. Participants in the study were asked about their family's medical history, which may increase a man's risk of developing prostate cancer, and their PSA screening history, which can lead to overdiagnosis of the condition. Men were also asked to self-report their circumcision status, number of sexual partners, and their history of STIs. Circumcision was reported in 68.8% of the cases and 71.5% of the controls. Caucasian men more commonly reported circumcision (69%) than African American men (43%). For 91% who reported circumcision, the procedure was performed shortly after birth. A few potential caveats to note include the reliance on self-reporting when it comes to a man's history of STIs, as well as his sexual partners. A cursory review of the data suggests, for example, that the number of male sexual partners is greatly underreported. Male-to-male sexual activity has been shown to lead to an increased rate in STIs, including HIV. This gives pause to make one wonder what other facts were underreported, though the numbers of circumcised vs. not circumcised do fall in line with national survey results. The bottom line from the American Cancer Society: While this is an interesting finding, it's not likely to spur any change in recommendations or medical practice.",0,story_reviews_00899
"Now that we're deep into the cold and flu season, it's safe to assume that germs are hiding pretty much everywhere — the keypad at the grocery store checkout, the handrail on the bus, the air around that miserable-looking co-worker. Avoiding germs entirely would require something like solitary confinement or a head-to-toe application of Purell. As an alternative, many people try to do what they can to strengthen their immune systems. Vitamin C is old news, and echinacea and other herbs haven't really panned out. But there's a livelier option: probiotic supplements that supposedly fortify the immune system. Each capsule of Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity from ReNew Life Formulas Inc. of Clearwater, Fla., contains 10 billion cultures of the yeast Saccharomyces boulardii. Users are instructed to take two capsules a day with a light meal. A bottle of 30 capsules, sold at Whole Foods and many other health food stores, costs about $30. A capsule of Probiotic Immunity from New Chapter Inc., based in Brattleboro, Vt., contains 1 billion each of 10 different organisms, including Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus and Lactobacillus acidophilus, two species of bacteria often found in yogurt. Other ingredients include herbs such as cumin, ginger and spinach. Users are instructed to take two capsules each day, preferably one in the morning and one in the evening, on an empty stomach. You can buy a bottle of 90 capsules for about $20 at many health food stores. Advertisement The claims The website for Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity says that it ""provides seasonal immune support"" and ""enhances respiratory health and immunity."" Put together, the statements seem to imply the product improves immunity against seasonal respiratory infections. But senior vice president of marketing Brian Colin says that the company cannot legally claim to prevent or treat any disease, including the cold and flu. Instead, he says that Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity can ""promote overall immune health."" The website for Probiotic Immunity says that the product ""helps promote optimal digestive and immune system function."" A brochure provided by the company said that the supplement offers ""live probiotics for optimal immune health."" As with Ultimate Flora Advanced Immunity, users are left to themselves to speculate exactly which illnesses their newly optimal immune system might be fighting off. The bottom line Advertisement It may seem odd, but there's no doubt that a capsule full of live yeast or bacteria could help stimulate the immune system and potentially ward off illness, says Paul Forsythe, a respiratory specialist and assistant professor of medicine at McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. But, as Forsythe noted in an April 2011 issue of the journal Chest, most of the research on probiotics has been conducted in mice, and the real-world immunity benefits for humans are uncertain. Companies ""are taking evidence from animal studies and stretching their claims,"" he says. Still, Forsythe sees some room for hope that the right probiotic could make the cold and flu season a little less miserable. ""There is some evidence that certain strains [of probiotics] can reduce the severity and duration of a cold."" A September 2011 Cochrane Review of 14 studies found ""weak"" evidence that probiotics could help prevent the common cold and other upper respiratory infections in infants, children and younger adults. And an April 2011 study in the European Journal of Clinical Nutrition found a Lactobacillus probiotic seemed to improve the immune system's response following a flu vaccination. Dr. Sonia Michail, a pediatric gastroenterologist at Children's Hospital Los Angeles, says the basic idea behind so-called immunity-boosting probiotics makes sense. As she explains, the gut is a major front in the immune system's war against pathogens, and the immune cells there must respond to the resident bacteria. If helpful bacteria can activate immune cells in the gut, the disease fighters will spread throughout the body. But according to Michail, studies suggest that, for unknown reasons, only some people — perhaps as few as 1 in 30 — could hope to avoid a cold by taking probiotics. And, she adds, the evidence for even this modest benefit ""is far from robust."" Forsythe says that probiotics are generally safe and might be worth a try, if only for the extra peace of mind. He adds that if he were going to try a product, he'd choose one with only a single strain. One other thing: ""I wouldn't waste my money on anything expensive,"" he says.

"Since her teens, Lesa Merlo, of Hinsdale, had learned to compensate as her hearing declined. She used the television's closed-captioning feature. She read lips and paid attention to body language. Often, it meant only being able to do one thing at a time, explained the mother of three young children. Now, thanks to an implant called Esteem, Merlo can multitask. ""I can make dinner and supervise homework at the same time,"" she said. ""I don't have to stop and look directly at the children. I can hear what they're saying behind my back."" Unlike a hearing aid, which amplifies sounds, Esteem is a prosthetic inner-ear stimulator. ""When I wore a hearing aid, I turned it off when I got home because all the background noise was so agitating,"" said Merlo, 40. ""But I keep (the Esteem) on."" A controller the size of a cellphone enables her to set her Esteem to different environments, such as ""home,"" ""restaurant"" or ""school."" Merlo's doctor, ear surgeon Sam Marzo of Loyola University Medical Center in Maywood, has performed 40 Esteem implants since he was trained by its manufacturer, Envoy Medical Corp. in St. Paul, Minn., in 2010. He is the only Chicago-area surgeon authorized to implant the device, said an Envoy representative. Esteem was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in March 2010. (For surgeons outside Chicago, visit envoymedical.com.) ""This really fills a need for adults with moderate to severe sensorineural hearing loss,"" Marzo said. The condition is caused by damage to the inner ear or to nerves from the inner ear to the brain. For patients with profound hearing loss, a cochlear implant is a better option, he said. ""Esteem is great for people who have used hearing aids but are not happy with them,"" Marzo said. ""Aids require a lot of upkeep and need frequent battery changes. And they amplify all the noise so it's hard to filter out background noise."" Implanting the Esteem is a three-hour outpatient procedure done under general anesthesia. About two months post-surgery, when internal swelling has subsided, the doctor turns on the device. ""It is surgery, so there is pain at first,"" Merlo said. ""But within a few days I was comfortable. I had an incision behind my ear, but my hair covers it. Cosmetically, you can't see anything now."" The implant is permanent. It contains a battery that must be replaced in about seven years. Merlo had Esteem implanted in her left ear in September. In March, she plans to have one put in her right ear. Even with one implant, Merlo called the results ""surreal."" ""There are little things that I probably heard when I was younger, before my hearing loss, but I don't remember them,"" she said. ""Since I got the implant, they're new to me. Branches tapping the windows, the breathing of the horses when I ride, different instruments in my favorite songs. I always loved music but now I can really hear it."" The implant also allows Merlo to hear herself talking. ""That helps my speech,"" she said. ""Now I know if I blur my THs."" Merlo said her children no longer have to be her extra ears, telling her when the oven timer beeps or when the doorbell rings. ""Now they tell me, 'You never say 'What?' anymore,"" she said. ""My husband and I joke that the best wife is the one who doesn't hear,"" Merlo said. ""But not hearing affects everything. People used to think I was standoffish in social situations because I was quiet. I nodded a lot because I couldn't hear them. Now I can.""",1,story_reviews_00935
"(Reuters) - People who eat lots of magnesium-rich foods such as leafy green vegetables, nuts and beans have fewer strokes, according to an international analysis covering some 250,000 people. Some of more than 8,000lbs of locally grown broccoli from a partnership between Farm to School and Healthy School Meals is served in a salad to students at Marston Middle School in San Diego, California, March 7, 2011. REUTERS/Mike Blake But the authors of the study, published in the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition, stopped short of recommending people take a daily magnesium supplement because their analysis focused on magnesium in food — and it may be another aspect of the food that is responsible for their finding. ""Dietary magnesium intake is inversely associated with risk of stroke, specifically ischemic stroke,"" wrote lead author Susanna Larsson, a professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, Sweden. The results suggest that people eat a healthy diet with ""magnesium-rich foods such as green leafy vegetables, nuts, beans and whole grains,"" she added. Larsson and her colleagues combed through research databases spanning the last 45 years to find studies that tracked how much magnesium people took and how many of them had a stroke over time. In seven studies published in the past 14 years, about 250,000 people in the United States, Europe and Asia were followed for an average of 11.5 years. About 6,500 of them, or three percent, had a stroke in the time they were followed. For every extra 100 milligrams of magnesium a person ate per day, their risk of an ischemic stroke — the most common kind, typically caused by a blood clot — fell by nine percent. The median magnesium intake for U.S. citizens included in the analysis was 242 milligrams a day. The United States recommends that men and women over age 31 eat 420 and 320 milligrams of magnesium daily, respectively. Most of the studies allowed the researchers to rule out other factors, such as family history. But Larsson told Reuters Health in an email that she could not say whether other aspects of what the people ate partially or entirely explained the finding. More in-depth studies are needed before researchers can say that the magnesium was what actually reduced the stroke risk, she added. Other experts said the results were consistent with dietary recommendations. ""It's a diet that's rich in fruits, vegetables and grains. Those are things that have low sodium, high potassium and high magnesium,"" said Larry Goldstein, director of the stroke center at the Duke University Medical Center in Durham, North Carolina. ""It's again the diet per se, not any one individual component of the diet."" SOURCE: bit.ly/AhalBY",0,story_reviews_00936
"Jan. 9, 2012 -- Nicotine replacement therapies such as gums or patches may not help smokers kick the habit long-term, a new study shows. Relapse rates of the quitters were similar during the study period, whether they used the products alone or with counseling, or they did not use them. ""Nicotine replacement therapies ... do not show any long-term effect on quitting even when combined with counseling,"" says researcher Gregory Connolly, DMD, director of the Center for Global Tobacco Control and professor of public health at the Harvard School of Public Health. Behavioral counseling is widely recommended, with medication, to help smokers quit. The results of the new study are published online in Tobacco Control. The findings are at odds with clinical trials, Connolly says. The new study, however, draws from the population. It gives a more ''real world'' picture, he tells WebMD. Smoking cessation experts and a maker of nicotine replacement therapies took issue with the findings. Connolly does not advocate abandoning the nicotine replacement medication. Instead, he suggests understanding its use. ""In the short term, what it is designed for is treatment of withdrawal,"" he says. ""Long term, our study would not say it would prevent relapse."" Better strategies are needed to prevent relapse, he tells WebMD.",0,story_reviews_00940
"Smokers who count on nicotine patches or gum to help them quit may want to reconsider: A new study finds that these and other nicotine replacement products aren't effective at preventing former smokers from relapsing in real-world conditions. Among 787 adults who had quit smoking within the previous two years, nearly a third reported having returned to using cigarettes, according to a study published online Monday by the journal Tobacco Control. Those who had used nicotine patches, gum, inhalers or nasal sprays were just as likely to relapse as those who had quit without them, researchers from Harvard University and the University of Massachusetts found. The findings run counter to the results of several randomized clinical trials conducted before the Food and Drug Administration gave the thumbs-up to these nicotine replacement products in the 1990s. In those trials, volunteers using such products were up to three times more likely to kick the smoking habit. But the latest results are in line with other studies that have found little — if any — benefit from the products when used by smokers in real life. In some cases, studies have found that people who use products like nicotine patches and gums are more likely to relapse than their counterparts who go cold turkey. Advertisement ""This may indicate that some heavily dependent smokers perceive NRT [nicotine replacement therapy] as a sort of ‘magic' pill, and, upon realizing it is not, they find themselves without support in their quitting efforts, doomed to failure,"" the researchers wrote. The new study examined former smokers three times over a five-year period. At the midpoint of the study, 30.6% of recent quitters had gone back to smoking. By the end, 31.3% had relapsed. American smokers spend more than $1.5 billion on nicotine gum, patches and related products each year, according to the study. Much of that comes from public health programs, which are facing further rounds of budget cuts. Policymakers ought to rethink their willingness to pay for nicotine replacement therapy, the researchers wrote, and consider shifting that money to initiatives aimed at discouraging smoking in general, such as anti-smoking campaigns and efforts to raise tobacco taxes. But GlaxoSmithKline Consumer Healthcare, which makes Nicorette, Nicoderm, Commit lozenges and other smoking cessation products, said that would be premature. The company noted that most of the adults in the study who used nicotine replacement products didn't use them for the recommended eight weeks. Had those people followed directions, they might have had more success. Advertisement ""Hundreds of clinical trials involving more than 35,000 participants and extensive consumer use for more than 20 years have proven both the efficacy and safety of NRT when used as directed,"" the company said in a statement. ""NRT products have helped millions of smokers quit by gradually weaning them off of their tobacco addiction and is recommended as a first-line therapy for quitting."" karen.kaplan@latimes.com",0,story_reviews_00942
"If losing weight was one of your New Year's resolutions, you might already be growing weary of counting calories and working out. Wouldn't it be great if you could slim down without so much effort? Anyone looking for a shortcut to weight loss might be tempted to try one of many supplements that claim to burn fat and boost metabolism. These products often contain a not-especially-exotic ingredient that's already a staple of the American lifestyle: caffeine. The morning coffee drinkers at Dunkin' Donuts notwithstanding, caffeine has a strong reputation as a weight-loss aid. The stimulant is one of the key ingredients of Zantrex-3, the popular weight-loss supplement from Zoller Laboratories, based in Salt Lake City. The company claims each capsule contains ""up to"" 160 milligrams of ""caffeine and caffeine-like stimulants"" (from green tea and yerba mate, among other sources), while a government database of supplements says each capsule of Zantrex-3 contains more than 160 mg of caffeine. That's slightly more than you'd get from a typical double shot of espresso. Other ingredients include ginseng and damiana, a Latin American herb traditionally used as an aphrodisiac. Users are instructed to take two capsules with a glass of water before a meal or anytime during the day when they need an energy boost. According to the label, they shouldn't take more than six capsules in a day. Zantrex-3 is available at many drugstores. You can expect to pay about $20 for a package of 30 capsules. Advertisement LipoFuze, a weight-loss supplement from E Nutrition Research, based in Orem, Utah, also packs a significant amount of caffeine. The label says that each capsule contains 200 mg of a green tea extract that is 50% caffeine. Other ingredients include vitamin D, chromium and coenzyme Q10. Users are instructed to take two capsules a day. A package of 60, a one-month's supply, costs about $50. The claims The website for Zantrex-3 says it provides both extreme energy and rapid weight loss — ""546% more weight loss than the leading ephedra-based diet pill,"" to be exact. The site features a picture of reality TV star (and official product endorser) Nicole ""Snooki"" Polizzi of ""Jersey Shore"" pulling a bottle of the pills out of her purse. (The website calls her a ""celebrity,"" and, yes, the term is in quotation marks.) Advertisement Amy Heaton, director of scientific affairs for Zoller, says that caffeine and caffeine-like compounds have been proved to improve energy, stamina, concentration, mood and metabolism. But, she says, ""they have not been shown to significantly increase weight loss."" Heaton adds that ""it's not just about weight loss. It's about fat loss and increased energy."" To drive home the message, she points to Snooki's transformation ""from a self-professed meatball to a sexy and slim fireball."" The website for LipoFuze says that the supplement ""increases the metabolic mechanism in your body."" The site also says the green tea and caffeine will ""rev up your metabolism"" and ""increase energy, focus and physical performance."" The site features testimonials it says are from users who claim they have lost huge amounts of weight with the help of LipoFuze. One man says he dropped more than 100 pounds, although it's unclear how long that took. A woman says she lost 40 pounds in less than a year, including 20 pounds in her first month. Attempts to reach E Nutrition Research for comment were not successful. The bottom line Caffeine shows up in a lot of weight-loss products, but it doesn't seem to be any sort of silver bullet against flab, says C. Michael White, a professor of pharmacy at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. White says that, to his knowledge, there are no well-designed studies showing that caffeine works better than a placebo when it comes to weight loss. White notes that caffeine is a diuretic, which means that people taking large doses might shed some weight through water loss, but that's not the kind of slimming most users are looking for. As reported in a 2010 issue of the International Journal of Obesity, caffeine may in fact be able to increase a person's metabolic rate by 4% or 5%. But, according to White, there's no clear evidence that this translates into actual weight loss. One possible explanation: Any increase in metabolism might go hand-in-hand with a boost in appetite, he says. Advertisement Caffeine does seem to enhance the weight-loss powers of some other ingredients, White says. For example, green tea contains antioxidants that encourage cells to burn extra calories, and caffeinated green tea seems to promote more weight loss than decaf versions. But even this combination yields very modest results. ""In clinical trials, the weight loss is 2.5 to 4 pounds, not 40 pounds,"" White says. Gerald Endress, the fitness director of the Duke Diet and Fitness Center at Duke University in Durham, N.C., says patients often ask about caffeine as a weight-loss aid. ""I tell them it's definitely not going to be as helpful as 30 minutes of exercise."" Endress says a little caffeine before a workout might help a person exercise harder and longer, which could theoretically help them control their weight. But the real credit would go to the exercise, not the caffeine. Endress also warns that too much caffeine — such as the high doses found in Zantrex — could cause jitteriness, anxiety, spikes in blood pressure and rapid heartbeats in some people.

"En Español By Denise Mann HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Dec. 27, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A new test measuring levels of troponin I in the blood may help determine whether someone is really having a heart attack earlier than is currently possible. Troponin I is a protein that is released into the bloodstream when the heart muscle has been damaged such as during a heart attack. The more damage there is to the heart, the more troponin there will be in the blood. Existing tests measure troponin T or troponin I. The new study looked at a highly sensitive type of troponin I test that may be more accurate in less time. The findings appear in the Dec. 28 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association. Researchers led by Dr. Till Keller at the University Heart Center in Hamburg, Germany, compared the new highly sensitive troponin I test with the current test and other blood markers for heart attack among 1,818 people who showed symptoms of a possible heart attack. Of these, 413 were deemed to be having a heart attack. The troponin tests were more predictive than other biomarkers used to make the diagnosis, the study showed. The new test was more sensitive than the existing one. This means that if a test result is negative, the person is not having a heart attack. Another measure, specificity, rules in disease with a high degree of confidence. The issue with available troponin testing has been that they must be repeated two more times over the next 12 to 16 hours for accurate readings. The new test yields sensitive results in three hours. The study was partially funded by Brahms AG and Abbott Diagnostics. Abbott Diagnostics developed both the new and the conventional troponin tests used in the study. ""We can rule out heart attacks more quickly with the new test,"" said Dr. Sandra Chaparro, a cardiologist at the University of Miami Hospital in Florida. ""If the patient presents to an emergency room less than three hours after chest pain, we can make a diagnosis of a heart attack."" Many people come to the emergency room with chest pain. Typically, the doctor orders an electrocardiogram (EKG) to check for problems with the electrical activity of the heart, along with blood work. Not all EKG readings are abnormal during a heart attack, Chaparro explained. This is where the blood test would be used. ""It is very common to have people going to the hospital with chest pain and it could be something important or something not significant,"" she said. A more sensitive test could save a lot of money, she noted. Dr. Michael Lanigan, an emergency room doctor at the SUNY Downstate Medical Center in Brooklyn, NYC, said the ultimate goal is a highly specific and sensitive test that can tell doctors right away if you are having a heart attack. The new test ""helps push the envelope further,"" he said. ""We need a blood test that can tell people when they walk in or soon thereafter that they are having a heart attack because the sooner you make the diagnosis, the sooner you can start the right therapy.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - A hormone called DHEA and mostly secreted by the adrenal glands may be able to help women who are going through menopause and could also give them better sex lives, a study found on Tuesday. Italian researchers writing in the journal of the International Menopause Society, Climacteric, said they had found the first robust evidence that low doses of DHEA can help sexual function and menopausal symptoms, suggesting it may one day become an alternative to hormone replacement therapy (HRT). But they stressed that the trial was small, so far larger studies are needed to confirm the results. ""We must bear in mind that this is a pilot study with a small sample,"" Anna Fenton, co-editor of Climacteric, said in commentary on the work. ""We can't yet say that this study means that DHEA is a viable alternative to HRT, but ... we should be looking to do larger studies to confirm these initial results."" DHEA, or dehydroepiandrosterone, is a natural steroid hormone mostly made in the adrenal glands and has a variety of therapeutic uses. HRT, which is a combination of the hormones oestrogen and progesterone, is an approved treatment for women going through the menopause, who often experience unpleasant symptoms such as hot flushes, night sweats, loss of sex drive and mood swings. But sales of HRT drugs have fallen sharply since a large study in 2002 found higher rates of ovarian cancer, breast cancer and strokes in women who took the pills, and the search has since been on for alternatives. American researchers said in January that the antidepressant Lexapro, made by drugmaker Forest Laboratories, significantly cut the number and severity of hot flushes in menopausal women, and other antidepressants including GlaxoSmithKline's Paxil and the Pfizer drugs Prozac and Effexor also have been found to be effective. For this trial, a team of researchers led by Andrea Genazzani of the University of Pisa followed a group of 48 post-menopausal women with troubling symptoms. Over a year, 12 women took vitamin D and calcium, 12 took DHEA, 12 took standard HRT and 12 took a synthetic steroid called tibolone which is used to alleviate menopausal symptoms. The women's menopausal symptoms, sexual interest and activity were measured using a standard questionnaire that explores factors such as satisfaction with frequency of sex, vaginal lubrication, orgasm, and sexual partner. After 12 months, all the women on hormone replacements had improvements in menopausal symptoms, but those taking vitamin D and calcium did not show any significant improvement. At the start of the trial, all groups had similar sexual activity, but after the year, those taking calcium and vitamin D scored an average of 34.9 on the questionnaire scale, while those taking DHEA had a score of 48.6, showing that those on DHEA had more sexual interest and activity. The results for the HRT group were similar, and both the HRT DHEA groups showed a higher level of sexual intercourse in comparison to the control group, the researchers said. Genazzani said the results showed DHEA has potential, especially for those women who may have problems in taking more conventional HRT. ""But this is a small study, a proof of concept. What we need to do now is to look at a larger study, to confirm that these initial results are valid,"" she added.",0,story_reviews_00954
"The delivery virus, carrying a good version of the human gene for the clotting agent known as Factor IX, was prepared by researchers at St. Jude Children's Research Hospital in Memphis. The patients had been recruited and treated with the virus in England by a team led by Dr. Amit C. Nathwani of University College London; researchers at the Children's Hospital of Philadelphia monitored their immune reactions. Hemophilia B is caused by a defect in the gene for Factor IX. Fatal if untreated, the disease occurs almost only in men because the Factor IX gene lies on the X chromosome, of which men have only a single copy. Women who carry a defective gene on one X chromosome can compensate with the good copy on their other X chromosome, but they bequeath the defective copy to half their children. About one in 30,000 of newborn boys have the disease, with about 3,000 patients in the United States. Dr. Nathwani and his team reported that they treated the patients by infusing the delivery virus into their veins. The virus homes in on the cells of the liver, and the gene it carries then churns out correct copies of Factor IX. A single injection enabled the patients to produce small amounts of Factor IX, enough that four of the six could stop the usual treatment, injections of Factor IX concentrate prepared from donated blood. The other two patients continued to need concentrate, but less frequently. Photo Treating a patient with concentrate costs $300,000 a year, with a possible lifetime cost of $20 million, but the single required injection of the new delivery virus costs just $30,000, Dr. Katherine P. Ponder of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis notes in her commentary in The New England Journal of Medicine, calling the trial ""a landmark study."" The patients have continued to produce their own Factor IX for up to 22 months, said Dr. Edward G. D. Tuddenham, director of the Hemophilia Center at the Royal Free Hospital in London. One patient, a geologist, had a good response at first, but his level of Factor IX has declined to 1 percent of normal, the level at which the disease kicks in. ""We attribute this to the fact that he had an inflammation, and although we treated it promptly, we should have been quicker off the mark,"" Dr. Tuddenham said.

""He's very philosophic about it, but he's a scientist, and his motivation is to help the science,"" Dr. Tuddenham said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Twenty more patients will be treated to assess the best dose of the virus, the goal being the highest dose that does not set off an immune system attack, Dr. Tuddenham said. ""We are pretty close to the sweet spot,"" he said. If all goes well, a genetic treatment for hemophilia B ""could be available for widespread use in a couple of years."" In a trial in 2006, a patient injected with a corrective gene produced his own Factor IX but only for 10 weeks. The designer of that treatment, Dr. Katherine A. High of Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, said the new therapy had worked because the delivery virus had been made more efficient and because the research team had treated the patients with steroids to suppress immune system attacks on the virus. ""I think it's incredibly exciting, and I say that even though these people are my competitors,"" she said. Dr. High is listed as a co-author of the report because her laboratory helped monitor the patients and provided proof for regulators that the virus would not insert its human gene into the patients' sperm and make the change hereditary. A serious problem with other delivery viruses is that they insert themselves randomly into chromosomes, sometimes disrupting a gene. The virus used by Dr. Nathwani's team, known as adeno-associated virus-8, generally stays outside the chromosomes, so it should not present this problem. Still, patients will need to be monitored for liver cancer, a small possibility that has been observed in mice. ""I don't think it's a showstopper, but it's a critical safety issue that has to be assessed,"" Dr. High said. Patients have little or no immunity to the adeno-associated virus, which infects rhesus monkeys. The virus has a propensity for making liver cells its target, which is good for the therapy because these cells are the natural producers of Factor IX. However, liver cells do not live forever and slowly replenish themselves, possibly limiting how long the therapy will last. About 80 percent of hemophilia cases are of the type known as hemophilia A, which is caused by defects in a different blood-clotting agent, Factor VIII. Researchers have focused on hemophilia B, in part, because the Factor IX gene is much smaller and easier to work with.",0,story_reviews_00958
"Dec. 2, 2011 (Chicago) -- An experimental approach in which penile nerve tissue is frozen to knock out overactive nerves helped men with premature ejaculation last three times longer.

"TUESDAY, Nov. 1, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Multiple sclerosis patients may eventually benefit from a novel treatment that takes aim at the abnormal behavior of a specific type of immune cell, preliminary research suggests. The errant behavior of the cells in question -- known as ""B cells"" -- is viewed as key to the development of this chronic and disabling nervous system disease, commonly called MS. The new therapy's potential is only in the early stages of exploration, cautions an international study team comprised of researchers from the United States, Canada, Switzerland and the Netherlands, in the report published in the Nov. 1 online edition of The Lancet. But initial indications suggest that the new antibody drug, called ocrelizumab, successfully targets these renegade cells with hopeful results: a significant reduction in disease-related inflammatory brain lesions. ""Our findings show that ocrelizumab rapidly suppresses inflammatory activity,"" noted the study authors, led by Dr. Ludwig Kappos from the University Hospital, Basel, Switzerland, in a journal news release. Describing the targeting of B cells as an ""innovative therapeutic approach,"" Kappos and his colleagues reported that in testing among 218 patients, the drug's impact on lesions was ""rapid and pronounced."" What's more, to date the treatment appears to be safe. The study authors noted that MS is a progressively debilitating disease that attacks an individual's central nervous system, disrupting the normal brain, spinal cord and optic nerve function. A classic characteristic of the disease is inflammation, which takes the form of brain lesions. The immune system's T cells have long been implicated in disease progression, but the notion that B cells may also play a major role is relatively new. With this new potential target in mind, researchers configured ocrelizumab to specifically focus on a protein (CD20) found on the surface of certain B cells. To test the drug, Kappos and his team recruited patients aged 18 to 55 seeking MS treatment in 79 centers in 20 countries. The patients were divided into four groups, treated with: a low dose of ocrelizumab (600 milligrams); a high dose of ocrelizumab (2,000 mg); a well-known MS inflammation treatment known as ""intramuscular interferon beta-1a""; or a sugar pill (placebo). After 24 weeks, some of the doses were adjusted. The result: at week 24, all of the patients receiving either dose of ocrelizumab fared better in terms of lesion count than either the placebo or standard treatment groups. The number of active lesions had dropped 89 percent more among the 600-mg group compared with those getting a placebo. Similarly, those in the 2,000-mg group experienced a 96 percent bigger drop in lesions. What's more, relapse rates were much lower among those taking the new drug, in contrast to those taking a placebo. The investigators further noted that even eight months after treatment launch, no serious adverse effects were directly attributable to the new drug. That said, Dr. Moses Rodriguez, a professor of neurology and immunology at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., disputed the premise that ocrelizumab is shaping up as anything new and innovative. ""In fact, there's nothing novel about this at all,"" he said. ""There is another drug, called rituximab, that's been in early trials for MS for years. And all this new drug is attempting to do is replicate the same that rituximab already does. And I see no major advantage of this drug versus that older drug. It's not better or worse. It's the same,"" Rodriguez noted. ""So bottom-line, I would not sell this as a major breakthrough in MS,"" cautioned Rodriguez. ""It's not."" Funding for the study was provided by F. Hoffmann-La Roche and Biogen Idec. Inc. More information For more on multiple sclerosis, visit the U.S. National Library of Medicine.",0,story_reviews_00978
"You wouldn't last very long without oxygen. But just as rust slowly eats away at a nail, oxygen can age your body. As your cells use this vital element, they produce free radicals — unstable molecules that can damage your tissues and add wear and tear to your entire body, including your skin. Many anti-aging products promise younger-looking skin through the power of antioxidants, compounds that help neutralize free radicals before they can do any harm. Antioxidants such as vitamin E, vitamin C and beta carotene show up in a lot of sunscreens and lotions. But if you want your antioxidants to go more than skin deep, you might be interested in oral supplements. Proleva, a supplement from Allmera Nutraceuticals, contains antioxidants from several different sources, including green tea, acai berries, goji berries and resveratrol, a compound found in grape skins. Users are instructed to take two capsules once a day. You can buy a bottle of 60 capsules on the company website for about $60. Vivida, a supplement from Lifes2Good Inc., contains astaxanthin, an antioxidant that's extracted from algae, along with vitamin C. Other ingredients include silica, from the horsetail plant, and a ""marine extract"" from cod and other ocean fish. Users are instructed to take one tablet in the morning and one in the evening. A bottle of 60 tablets costs about $50. Advertisement The claims According to the company website, Proleva is a ""fountain of youth"" that can give users ""youthful, glowing skin."" The site adds that ""healthy vibrant skin comes not from a cream but from within."" (The site also says that the supplement will improve memory, enhance the immune system and speed healing, but those are claims for another time.) Ron Slavick, the managing director of Allmera Nutraceuticals, says many Proleva customers boast of their softer, younger-looking skin. ""You can't treat skin with lotions and potions,"" he says. ""Healthy skin is a reflection of the health of the body."" He believes that the natural plant extracts in Proleva work better than the artificially produced antioxidants found in most multivitamins. The website for Vivida says that the product ""nourishes skin from the inside"" to make it ""smoother, firmer, and healthier."" Lifes2Good President Mark Holland says that antioxidants help ""take impurities away from the skin"" while softening fine lines and wrinkles. According to Holland, the antioxidants work together with the marine extract to keep the skin moist and supple. Advertisement The bottom line Over the years, scientists have largely dashed the hopes that antioxidants could be the secret to good health and longer lives. Studies have failed to show that antioxidant supplements such as vitamin E and beta carotene can prevent heart disease, cancer or other major diseases. There's still some hope that antioxidants can help the skin, but the results likely aren't as dramatic as the companies suggest, says Dr. Patricia Farris, a fellow of the American Academy of Dermatology who has a cosmetic dermatology practice in Metarie, La. ""These products are over-hyped,"" Farris says. ""Only a few studies show that you can improve the appearance of skin with any type of supplement."" According to Farris, some but not all studies suggest that antioxidants can help protect the skin from sun damage, one of the major causes of wrinkles. But she notes that this would only prevent signs of aging, not fix any problems that a person already has. ""I tell patients that antioxidants might help protect the skin, but they won't repair the skin,"" she says. Proponents of antioxidants can point to a few studies with encouraging results. For example, a German study of 36 adults published in 2006 in the journal Skin Pharmacology and Physiology found that volunteers taking supplements containing the antioxidants lutein, selenium and lycopene (among other things) had measurably smoother skin after 12 weeks. There were no such benefits for the subjects taking a placebo. The changes were assessed with a scanning device, and it's unclear if any benefits were visible to the naked eye. In an unpublished, company-funded study provided by Holland, 83 women who took Vivida reported generally positive results. After 12 weeks, 74% said that their skin looked smoother and softer. These results weren't confirmed by a dermatologist or anyone else, and there was no control group for comparison. Plant-based nutrients deserve more study, but the field is still in its infancy, says Dr. David McDaniel, an assistant professor of clinical dermatology at Eastern Virginia Medical School who runs a cosmetic dermatology clinic in Virginia Beach. Because products vary widely in their ingredients and their doses, he can't recommend any particular product without evidence to back it up. ""Without well-designed, statistically valid trials, I'm a skeptic,"" he says. Advertisement Curious about a consumer health product? Send an email to health@latimes.com.

"""If you have a technique to soften the cataract, there appears to be less chance of damage [to the eye ],"" Salz says. ""There certainly seems to be a benefit to using the laser,"" says American Academy of Ophthalmology (AAO) spokesman James Salz, MD, clinical professor of ophthalmology at the University of Southern California in Los Angeles. He reviewed the findings for WebMD. Standard vs. Laser Cataract Surgery More than 1.5 million cataract surgeries are performed annually in the U.S. One in three mostly older Americans will have the surgery at some point in their lives. The surgery is performed to remove the natural lens of the eye after it has become clouded over time. A permanent artificial lens is then implanted to replace the natural lens and provide appropriate vision correction for each patient. Currently, most aspects of cataract surgery, including the initial incision and the breakup and removal of the clouded lens from the lens capsule, are performed manually by the surgeon. An ultrasound instrument with a vibrating needle is used to break up the cataracts, and a vacuum sucks them out. The new studies looked at using the so-called femtosecond laser to deliver near-infrared light to fragment the cataract into tiny segments prior to removal. ""The idea is that all the surgeon will have to do is remove the pieces with a vacuum,"" says researcher Mark Packer, MD, of Oregon Health and Sciences University in Portland. ""Ideally, you won't need ultrasound, or at least you'll need less ultrasound."" That's important because ultrasound can cause collateral damage to the eye, he says. It can hinder recovery and cause clouding of the cornea, which is the clear outer layer of the eye. Although approved by the FDA, the femtosecond laser procedure is not widely used in the U.S., according to the American Academy of Ophthalmology.",0,story_reviews_00985
"En Español SUNDAY, Oct. 23, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Older women who take nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs -- such as aspirin or ibuprofen -- appear to have a lower risk of death from colorectal cancer than women who don't use these medications, a large new study suggests. Women who reported using these drugs, called NSAIDs, at the beginning of the study and three years later had a roughly 30 percent lower rate of death from colorectal cancer than women who did not take the drugs, or women who took them at only one of these two points in time, according to an American Association for Cancer Research (AACR) news release. ""Our results suggest that nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug use is associated with lower colorectal cancer mortality among postmenopausal women who use these medications more consistently and for longer periods of time,"" Anna Coghill, a doctoral student in epidemiology at the University of Washington and Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center, said in the news release. In the study, researchers examined the use of aspirin and non-aspirin NSAIDs among more than 160,000 postmenopausal women in relation to deaths from colorectal cancer. Study participants were enrolled in the Women's Health Initiative, which ""represents a large and well-characterized cohort [group] of postmenopausal women, and the medication data collected in this cohort made it possible for us to investigate multiple types, durations and strengths of NSAID use,"" Coghill explained. The researchers confirmed 2,119 cases of colorectal cancer and 492 deaths due to the disease. ""The results of our study help to further clarify the importance of different durations of NSAID use over time for the risk for dying from colorectal cancer,"" Coghill noted in the news release. While the study found an association between NSAID use and a reduced risk of colorectal cancer, it did not prove a cause-and-effect. The findings were slated for presentation on Sunday at the AACR International Conference on Frontiers in Cancer Prevention Research, in Boston. Experts say that for studies presented at medical meetings, data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"(Reuters) - Medtronic Inc, a manufacturer of pacemakers, heart stents and spine products, has developed a device to tackle another common health problem: erectile dysfunction. The medical device maker said it completed an initial feasibility study of 30 men, average age of 60, who suffered from erectile dysfunction (ED). After three months the results were promising, the company said. The stent — a tiny wire mesh tube similar to those used to prop open heart arteries — was placed in the internal pudendal artery, which supplies blood to the penis. The stent was delivered using a catheter threaded up to the pelvis, where the pudendal artery is located. It was placed in the artery, opening the vessel and allowing for better blood flow. ""ED is largely a vascular disease and that's why Medtronic was interested in this,"" said Dr. Jason Rogers of UC Davis Medical Center, one of the researchers of the company-sponsored trial. There are an estimated 30 million men in the United States who have ED and 300 million worldwide. Rogers said up to 50 percent of men discontinue drug therapy — which includes Viagra, Levitra and Cialis — either because it did not work or because they could not tolerate side effects, including lowering of blood pressure. He also noted that men who take certain drugs for heart disease cannot use the popular pills. ""There's a real unmet clinical need,"" Rogers said. Initial findings showed two-thirds of men who underwent the 1- to 2-hour procedure improved by at least 4 points on the 30-point Internal Index of Erectile Dysfunction scale, he said. There were no adverse events reported up to three months later, but Rogers acknowledged that risks may become evident much later. ""This is still investigational and requires more research. It is the inception of an entirely new way of treating ED that has never been seen before,"" he said. Rogers said it could be several years before Medtronic undertakes a much larger late-stage trial. Medtronic shares gained 2.3 percent to close at $33.64 on Wednesday.",1,story_reviews_00989
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Testing women for human papillomavirus (HPV) may catch more pre-cancerous growths than standard cervical cancer screening does — but more evidence is needed before the newer tests become routine, a study published Monday concludes. The report, in the Annals of Internal Medicine, sums up a research review done for the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF), an expert medical panel supported by the federal government. The USPSTF is set to update its recommendations on cervical cancer screening, which were last laid out in 2003. At that time, the task force recommended that sexually active women get regular Pap tests to screen for cervical cancer. But it said there was not enough evidence to recommend for or against newer types of testing — including HPV tests and the ""liquid-based"" Pap tests that are now more often used than the old-fashioned version. During Pap tests, cells are swabbed or scraped from the cervix for examination under a microscope to find cancer or possible pre-cancerous changes. In the so-called liquid-based version, the cells are placed in special preservative liquid designed to make the specimen easier to ""read""; those same cells can also be used for HPV testing (unlike the cells collected with conventional Pap tests). Exactly what impact the new research review will have on the USPSTF recommendations is anyone's guess. A draft of the guidelines will not be published until Wednesday, when it will be available for public comment on the task force website (here: 1.usa.gov/4xXexl). A lot of research has been done since the 2003 recommendations, said Dr. Evelyn P. Whitlock, a senior investigator with Kaiser Permanente Northwest in Portland, Oregon, who led the review. But there are still questions about the effects of HPV screening, and ""more complete evidence"" is needed before it becomes widely used, Whitlock and her colleagues write. HPV is a common virus that causes warts, including genital warts. Usually, the immune system clears the infection, but persistent infection with certain strains of HPV leads to cervical cancer in some women. So in recent years, tests for those ""high-risk"" HPV strains have been developed to help in screening for the disease. A few HPV tests are approved for use, along with Pap tests, for screening women age 30 or older. (The tests are not approved for younger women because they give doctors little information; younger women commonly have HPV infections that go away on their own.) It has not been clear exactly how HPV testing, or liquid-based Pap tests, measure up against standard Pap tests. In their review, Whitlock's team examined four clinical trials including more than 140,000 women that compared older Pap tests with the liquid-based version. They found that both tests had nearly the same ""sensitivity"" — which refers to their ability to detect cancer or pre-cancer. The tests also had the same ""specificity,"" which can be used to measure how often a screening test produces false-positive results. Across studies, the false-positive rate ranged between about six percent and 16 percent for both conventional and liquid-based Pap tests. ""It's reassuring to know that they perform equivalently,"" Whitlock told Reuters Health. In an interview, she noted that the decision of whether to do a conventional or liquid-based Pap test is not the patient's. It may not even be the doctor's — but may instead depend on whatever health system he or she is part of. Several other clinical trials in the review looked at HPV testing. In general, Whitlock's team found, HPV tests were more sensitive than conventional Pap tests, but they were less specific, meaning they had a higher false-positive rate. In a 2003 trial of more than 3,000 women, for example, HPV testing caught 96 percent of potentially pre-cancerous growths, versus 65 percent with Pap tests. But the false-positive rate was 15 percent, compared with two percent with Pap testing. The problem with that higher false-positive rate is that it could lead to needless biopsies and other tests, or treatment to remove abnormal-looking tissue. ""It's a tricky thing to get your mind around,"" Whitlock said. ""It may seem that if a test is more sensitive, it must be better. But it's more subtle than that. You're trying to make a tradeoff between sensitivity and specificity."" Since cervical cancer screening is repeated over time, what's needed is evidence of the longer-term effects of different tests, according to Whitlock. How often, for example, does HPV testing lead to biopsies, versus Pap testing? And no one knows yet whether HPV testing actually catches cervical cancer at an earlier stage, or reduces deaths from the disease, compared with Pap tests. Clinical trials are ongoing, Whitlock said. ""The state of the science will be changing relatively quickly, so we'll have to keep looking at this."" Right now, the American Cancer Society (ACS) and other medical groups recommend that women start Pap tests at age 21 or three years after they become sexually active, whichever comes first. Those should be done every one to two years until age 30; after age 30, women who've had three normal Pap tests in a row can be screened less often — every two to three years. Pap plus HPV testing, done every three years, is considered a ""reasonable option"" for women age 30 and up, according to the ACS. Whitlock called Pap testing ""one of the big public health success stories."" Nationally, the cervical cancer death rate dropped by 70 percent between 1955 and 1992, and routine Pap testing is credited for most of that decline. But many women still do not get regular Pap screening, Whitlock pointed out. It's thought that more than half of cervical cancer cases in the U.S. occur in women who've never been screened, or haven't been in the past five years. If more women received the screening that already exists, ""that would be a huge step forward,"" Whitlock said. An estimated 12,700 U.S. women will be diagnosed with cervical cancer this year, and nearly 4,300 will die from the disease, according to the ACS.

"En Español By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Oct. 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A small, preliminary study finds that ginger root supplements seem to reduce inflammation in the intestines -- a potential sign that the pills might reduce the risk of colon cancer. However, more study needs to be done, and the researchers aren't yet recommending that people head to the supplements' aisle or start gobbling up more ginger at meal times. ""If you want to add ginger to part of a healthy diet, that's great. But you can't make any conclusions about definite health benefits"" based on the study findings, said lead author Suzanna M. Zick, a naturopathic physician and research associate professor at University of Michigan Medical Center, Ann Arbor. The study, funded by the U.S. National Cancer Institute, was published online Oct. 11 in Cancer Prevention Research. Ginger, an herb, is found in supplements and in many foods such as ginger snaps and Asian dishes. Research has supported its use to treat stomach problems such as nausea and vomiting; the U.S. National Library of Medicine says it's ""likely safe,"" although some people may develop mild side effects. Previous research in animals has suggested that ginger can reduce inflammation but isn't potentially toxic to the stomach like aspirin, Zick noted. And scientists have linked chronic inflammation in the gut to colon cancer, suggesting that easing this inflammation could reduce the risk of the disease. In the new study, Zick's team randomly assigned 30 people to take pills containing 2 grams of ground ginger root extract or a ""dummy"" placebo pill each day for 28 days. They measured the level of inflammation in the participants' intestines before and after the test period. The amount of ginger in the pills is equivalent to 20 grams of raw ginger root, the authors said. That is probably well beyond what most people would eat in their regular diet, Zick noted. As for cost, she said that a month's supply of similar ginger supplements typically runs about $10 to $30. The researchers found that the level of inflammation in the subjects who took the ginger pills fell by an average of 28 percent, while staying about the same in those who took the placebo. If more funding becomes available, the researchers hope to launch a larger study, Zick said. But for now, she said, ""if you want to embrace ginger because you like the taste, go ahead,"" but there's no solid evidence that it prevents colon cancer. Dr. Andrew Chan, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and a gastroenterologist at Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, said the findings are promising because they hint at how ginger may prevent colon cancer. It's already clear that people with inflammatory conditions such as inflammatory bowel disease are at higher risk of colon cancer, he noted. ""We know there are anti-inflammatory drugs like aspirin that appear to have anti-cancer properties. And we know there are certain basic mechanisms which seem to be common to both inflammation and cancer,"" he said. Still, Chan said, ""it's much too early to tell whether ginger has anti-cancer properties."" More information There's more on ginger at the U.S. National Library of Medicine.",0,story_reviews_00995
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A sweet tooth isn't necessarily bad for your health— at least not when it comes to chocolate, hints a new study. Chocolates made by Belgian Christine Scholtes Covic are displayed in her Lika Chocolate workshop in the village of Rakovica, in the Croatian region of Lika, some 150 kilometres (93 miles) south of Zagreb January 21, 2011. REUTERS/Nikola Solic Researchers studying more than 33,000 Swedish women found that the more chocolate women said they ate, the lower their risk of stroke. The results add to a growing body of evidence linking cocoa consumption to heart health, but they aren't a free pass to gorge on chocolate. ""Given the observational design of the study, findings from this study cannot prove that it's chocolate that lowers the risk of stroke,"" Susanna Larsson from Karolinska Institutet in Stockholm told Reuters Health in an email. While she believes chocolate has health benefits, she also warned that eating too much of it could be counterproductive. ""Chocolate should be consumed in moderation as it is high in calories, fat, and sugar,"" she said. ""As dark chocolate contains more cocoa and less sugar than milk chocolate, consumption of dark chocolate would be more beneficial."" Larsson and her colleagues, whose findings appear in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology, tapped into data from a mammography study that included self-reports of how much chocolate women ate in 1997. The women ranged in age from 49 to 83 years. Over the next decade, there were 1,549 strokes, and the more chocolate women ate, the lower their risk. Among those with the highest weekly chocolate intake — more than 45 grams — there were 2.5 strokes per 1,000 women per year. That figure was 7.8 per 1,000 among women who ate the least (less than 8.9 grams per week). Scientists speculate that substances known as flavonoids, in particular so-called flavanols, may be responsible for chocolate's apparent effects on health. According to Larsson, flavonoids have been shown to cut high blood pressure, a risk factor for stroke, and improve other blood factors linked to heart health. Whether that theoretical benefit translates into real-life benefits remains to be proven by rigorous studies, however. Nearly 800,000 Americans suffer a stroke every year, with about a sixth of them dying of it and many more left disabled. For those at high risk, doctors recommend blood pressure medicine, quitting smoking, exercising more and eating a healthier diet — but so far chocolate isn't on the list.

"LONDON (Reuters) - British scientists conducting early-stage research have found that a potential new drug from GlaxoSmithKline could treat mixed-lineage leukemia(MLL) — the most common form of leukemia in babies. Signage is pictured on the company headquarters of GlaxoSmithKline in west London July 21, 2008. REUTERS/Toby Melville In a study published in the journal Nature, scientists from the British drugmaker collaborating with the charity Cancer Research UK (CRUK) and Cellzome AG found that the experimental drug, called I-BET151, mimics a chemical tag which is key to preventing the process of activating the leukemia genes. ""This ... is an exciting new avenue for drug discovery which we hope will be useful for other types of cancer in addition to MLL-leukaemias,"" said Tony Kouzarides of the Wellcome Trust/CRUK Gurdon Institute at Cambridge University, who co-led the study. Kevin Lee, head of epigenetics discovery research at GSK, who also worked on the study, said he too was excited about the findings, although it will probably be many years before the drug could potentially reach the market. ""Even though this is still lab-based ... it validates the idea of developing small molecules against epigenetic switches,"" he said in an emailed comment. ""It is important to remember we will need to be successful on a number of additional steps before we can move this from the lab to testing this compound in humans."" MLL leukemia is thought to account for up to 80 percent of cases of acute leukemia in children below two years old, and up to one in 10 cases in adults. Most patients don't respond well to standard leukemia treatments and often the cancer comes back. The disease is caused when a gene called MLL gets fused to another gene. This disrupts the normal function of MLL by creating a new ""fusion protein"" that behaves wrongly, switching on genes that drive the development of leukemia. Kouzarides's team found that in the disease, the MLL-fusion proteins are targeted to leukemia-causing genes by proteins from the BET family, which recognize certain chemical ""tags"" on chromatin, the scaffold on which DNA is arranged. Using I-BET151 to treat leukaemias in mice and human cancer cells in a lab, the researchers found that the chemical could halt the disease, paving the way for more research to be done in first-stage, or so-called Phase I, human trials. ""We urgently need better ways to treat children with more aggressive forms of leukemia, such as MLL,"" said Lesley Walker, CRUK's director of information. ""Although this research is only in the lab at the moment, we hope it will move quickly toward clinical trials in patients."" Leukemia is the most commonly diagnosed cancer in children and accounts for a around a third of all cancers diagnosed in children. According to Cancer Research UK, eight out of 10 children with leukemia in Britain now survive for five years or more, compared with one in 10 in the late 1960s.",1,story_reviews_01000

"By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, July 20 (HealthDay News)-- An experimental drug for treating Alzheimer's disease that previously showed troubling side effects may actually be safe in the long run, researchers report. The keys to the safety of the drug, bapineuzumab, may be lowering the dose and not giving it to patients with ApoE4, a gene mutation linked to Alzheimer's, according to two studies scheduled for presentation Wednesday at the Alzheimer's Association International Conference on Alzheimer's Disease in Paris. ""The data from the open-label trial are encouraging. Patients were able to tolerate bapineuzumab for two to four additional years without the emergence of any new safety concerns,"" said Dr. Stephen Salloway, author of one of the studies. ""This is important because we are conceptualizing this drug as a long-term treatment for Alzheimer's disease."" Encouraging does not translate into certainty, however, another expert pointed out. ""I think it is too early to tell from the data from this small Phase 2 safety trial,"" said Ian Murray, an assistant professor of neuroscience and experimental therapeutics at Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in College Station. ""We will have to wait for larger trials to comment on this as a potential therapy."" The studies were funded by Pfizer Inc. and Janssen Alzheimer Immunotherapy. Although bapineuzumab has shown promise in certain Alzheimer's patients, other research found that patients taking a higher dose of the drug had an increased risk of brain inflammation from water retention. This resulted in headache, memory loss, hallucinations, reduced coordination or other symptoms. But no problems were seen with lower doses. Bapineuzumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, which binds to and might be able to eliminate beta amyloid peptide in the brains of people with Alzheimer's. Most experts believe that the build up of beta amyloid proteins, which accumulate as plaque, is responsible for Alzheimer's. Salloway's study looked at the drug's safety in 194 Alzheimer's patients, most of whom had mild- to-moderate Alzheimer's and participated in a long-term (78 weeks or longer) study. Some of the participants were followed for four years or more. Ninety-one percent of participants had side effects, about a quarter of which were attributable to bapineuzumab. Of these, 85 percent were mild or moderate. The overall rate of vasogenic edema (water on the brain) was 9.3 percent, a number that decreased over time, said Salloway, a professor of neurology and psychiatry at Alpert Medical School of Brown University and director of the Butler Hospital Memory and Aging Program in Providence, R.I. The edema was symptomless in most cases, he said. The other study, which involved looking at more than 2,000 MRI scans from 262 patients, found 36 cases of amyloid-related imaging abnormalities (ARIA) may have been linked to the bapineuzumab. These imaging abnormalities may indicate inflammation of the brain caused by water retention. But only 8 of those 36 cases involved symptoms, and they were more likely to be found in patients with APOE-e4 who were taking higher doses of the drug. The likelihood of these effects diminished with additional infusions of lower-dose bapineuzumab. ""There is a growing sense that VE [vasogenic edema] or ARIA [amyloid-related imaging abnormalities] is a manageable side effect and may actually be a sign that the drug is clearing amyloid from the brain and the blood vessels,"" said Salloway. ""Treatment will require ongoing monitoring with MRI."" The researchers, who said monitoring of bapineuzumab will continue, are now awaiting the results of a larger Phase III trial on the drug. Because this study was presented at a medical meeting, the data and conclusions should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, July 11, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Teens who have high levels of folic acid appear to do better in school than those with lower levels, Swedish researchers report. ""Folate intake had a positive association with academic achievement"" in the students studied, the authors wrote in the report published in the July 11 online edition and the August print issue of Pediatrics. Not only should health providers monitor folic acid levels in teens, but the findings should influence school meals, school teaching and information given to parents, according to the researchers. Teens often have high levels of the blood protein homocysteine, an amino acid linked to heart disease, and low levels of folic acid. In previous studies, folic acid levels have been linked to mental ability; however, until now this had not been linked with improved school performance, the study authors said. ""We know that folate plays a really critical role in brain development and brain function,"" said Dr. Daniel Armstrong, associate chair of pediatrics at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine. ""We know that, in young children, folate deficiencies are associated with poorer neurocognitive function and neurocognitive development,"" he noted. In fact, folate deficiencies may be involved in the development of autism, he added. Armstrong thinks that a diet rich in folate might be important for brain functioning throughout life. ""It's one of those things that's no harm, no foul. It's not going to do us any harm and it might do us some good,"" he said. To find out whether folate might do some good, a team led by Dr. Torbjorn K. Nilsson, from the department of laboratory medicine at Orebro University Hospital in Sweden, collected data on folic acid levels in 386 teens aged 15 years. The researchers also looked at any possible effects of socioeconomic status and genetics. The investigators found that teens who had the highest levels of folic acid also got the best grades. None of the other factors they examined accounted for their finding, Nilsson's team noted. ""These results provide new information that points to the importance of keeping a closer watch on folate status in childhood and adolescence. They may also have direct implications for school meal provisions, school teaching programs and information to parents,"" the authors concluded. However, there is no scientific evidence that taking folate supplements will be beneficial, Armstrong noted. ""It's too early to say that everyone should start taking folate,"" he stressed. Folic acid is one of the B vitamins and is a key component in making DNA and RNA. Insufficient folic acid is a cause of certain birth defects of the spine and brain, including spina bifida. Among the elderly, folic acid consumption appears to affect mental ability, and low levels of this vitamin have been associated with dementia and Alzheimer's disease, according to several studies. Folic acid is found in leafy green vegetables, fruits, dried beans, peas and nuts. In addition, people can obtain folic acid from breads, cereals and other grain products enriched with folic acid, as well as folic acid supplements.

"July 7, 2011 -- An experimental therapy involving stem cell injections from the patient's own blood is showing promise in the treatment of people with chest pain that is not responsive to drugs, angioplasty, or surgery.

Losordo, MD, of Chicago's Northwestern University tells WebMD. ""Coronary artery disease involves not only the blockage of major arteries, but the death of small vessels, or capillaries, of the heart muscle,"" he says. ""This treatment targets these small vessels that have been damaged. The stem cells have shown the ability to repair and replace them in animal models."" The approach also showed promise in a 2007 pilot study involving fewer than 30 patients.

"En Español MONDAY, June 27, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Brilinta, an experimental anti-clotting medication currently awaiting U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval, performed better than the industry standard, Plavix, when used in tandem with low-dose aspirin, a new study finds. Heart patients who took Brilinta (ticagrelor) with low-dose aspirin (less than 300 milligrams) had fewer cardiovascular complications than those taking Plavix (clopidogrel) plus low-dose aspirin, researchers found. However, patients who took Brilinta with higher doses of aspirin (more than 300 milligrams) had worse outcomes than those who took Plavix plus high-dose aspirin, the investigators reported. Antiplatelet drugs are used to prevent potentially dangerous blood clots from forming in patients with acute coronary syndrome, including those who have had a heart attack. Brilinta has already been approved for use in many other countries. In July 2010, an FDA panel voted 7-to-1 to approve the use of Brilinta for U.S. patients undergoing angioplasty or stenting to open blocked arteries, but the approval process is still ongoing. The panel's recommendation was based in part on prior findings from this study, called the Platelet Inhibition and Patient Outcomes (PLATO) trial. In this latest analysis of PLATO findings, researchers found that patients who took Brilinta with low-dose aspirin were 16 percent less likely than those who took Plavix with low-dose aspirin to have a heart attack or stroke, or to die within a year. The findings were reported Monday in an American Heart Association online conference. One expert said the new information is valuable. ""The study highlights that if one chooses to use ticagrelor in subjects with acute coronary syndromes, it would be logical to use aspirin 81 milligrams per day (and not 325 mg daily),"" said Dr. Jeffrey S. Berger, assistant professor of medicine and director of cardiovascular thrombosis at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. ""Of note, there is little reason to ever use aspirin 325 mg except in the acute setting of a heart attack or stroke,"" he added. ""A higher aspirin dose (325 mg versus 81 mg) increases the risk of bleeding without increasing the efficacy of the drug."" A study author agreed that for most patients, using the drug with a lower dose of aspirin is usually warranted. ""Patients with acute coronary syndrome have options to prevent recurrent events,"" study lead author Dr. Kenneth W. Mahaffey, co-director of cardiovascular research at the Duke Clinical Research Institute, and associate professor of medicine at Duke University Medical Center, said in an AHA news release. ""Physicians choosing to use ticagrelor in countries where it is approved and available should consider using a low-dose of maintenance aspirin with the drug."" The data and conclusions of the research should be viewed as preliminary until published in a peer-reviewed journal.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Older people who use olive oil in their cooking and on their salads may have a lower risk of suffering a stroke, researchers reported Wednesday. Olive oils are seen at ""Barcelona Degusta"" the 3rd edition of the consumer food show in Barcelona March 6, 2009. REUTERS/Albert Gea In a study that followed older French adults for five years, researchers found that those who regularly used olive oil were 41 percent less likely to have a stroke than those who never used the oil. The findings, reported in the journal Neurology, hint that the well-known connection between olive oil and heart disease might extend to stroke as well. Olive oil is a key ingredient in the so-called Mediterranean diet. And some clinical trials have suggested that the diet helps control risk factors for heart disease, like high blood pressure, abdominal obesity and elevated levels of ""bad"" LDL cholesterol. High olive oil intake is also linked to a lower risk of heart attack, and a longer lifespan among heart attack survivors. These latest findings support the general advice that people replace dubious dietary fats — namely, saturated fats and ""trans"" fats — with olive oil and other unsaturated fats, according to an expert not involved in the study. But he also stressed that the study does not prove that olive oil, per se, helps prevent strokes. ""We need to remember that this is an observational study,"" said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center in New York who wrote an editorial published with the study. The study found a correlation between people's olive oil use and their stroke risk, he told Reuters Health — but that doesn't necessarily translate into cause-and-effect. ""People who use a lot of olive oil may be very different from people who don't,"" Scarmeas said. Olive oil users may, for example, have higher incomes, eat better overall or exercise more often than people who never use the oil. The researchers on the new study, led by Cécilia Samieri of the French national research institute INSERM, tried to account for those differences. And after they did, olive oil was still linked to a lower stroke risk. But it's impossible to fully account for all those variables, Scarmeas noted. What's needed, he said, are clinical trials where people are randomly assigned to use olive oil or not, then followed over time to see who suffers a stroke. Such clinical trials are considered the ""gold standard"" of medical evidence. The current study included 7,625 French adults age 65 and older who reported on their diets and other lifestyle factors. People who said they used olive oil for both cooking and as a dressing were considered ""intensive users."" Over the next five to six years, those intensive users suffered strokes at a rate of 0.3 percent per year. That compared with just over 0.5 percent among non-users, and 0.4 percent among moderate users. When the researchers factored in other diet habits, exercise levels and major risk factors for stroke — like high blood pressure and diabetes — heavy olive oil use was tied to 41 percent reduction in the odds of stroke. Samieri's team also took blood samples from another 1,245 older adults, measuring their levels of oleic acid — a monounsaturated fat that accounts for most of the fatty acids in olive oil. The one-third of participants with the highest oleic acid levels were 73 percent less likely to suffer a stroke than the one-third with the lowest levels. The findings, according to Scarmeas, argue for more research into olive oil's potential benefits against not only heart disease, but stroke and other neurological diseases as well. For now, he suggested that people choose olive oil and other unsaturated fats over saturated fats (found largely in meat and dairy) and trans fats (found in some processed foods, like crackers, cookies and chips). ""It's better to rely on this type of fat for your overall health,"" Scarmeas said. That said, no single food is consumed in isolation, he points out in his editorial. Olive oil is one part of the Mediterranean diet that has been tied to heart benefits. The diet also boasts plenty of fruits and vegetables, legumes, whole grains, fish and moderate amounts of red wine. SOURCE: bit.ly/SUxCM Neurology, online June 15, 2011.",0,story_reviews_01064
"Dr. Terrence Boyadjis, a psychiatrist in West Chester, demonstrates the use of transcranial magnetic stimulation on staff member Jennifer Knapp. The treatment involves using magnetic impulses to stimulate portions of the brain that control mood. A year and a half ago, Marie Duffy suffered from depression so debilitating that she could do nothing but cry. She had no interest in life, and she would wake up some mornings screaming as if she were in a nightmare. ""I figured that I would either spend the rest of my life in a living hell, or not have it - because I would see to it that I didn't have life anymore,"" she said. She had been on prescribed medication for depression for years, which until this point had been mild to moderate, but it was clear that the pills were not working anymore. And then she went to see Terrence Boyadjis, a psychiatrist in West Chester. Boyadjis uses NeuroStar therapy, developed by Malvern-based Neuronetics, which aims magnetic pulses at the brain to stimulate nerve cells likely involved in controlling mood. Studies show that the procedure, called Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation (TMS), works better than sham treatments to reduce depression with few apparent side effects. The magnetic stimulation costs up to $10,500 for a six-week regimen of care, is not yet covered by insurance, and may not work for many patients. The therapy, which carries a slight risk of seizures, is meant for patients with major treatment-resistant depression who do not respond to at least one medication. Still, the technology has enabled Neuronetics to get funding from Quaker BioVentures, a Philadelphia-based venture capital firm that invests in life-science companies. Quaker's current $700 million in committed capital is funding innovative treatments across the region. In Conshohocken, NuPathe has developed Zelrix, an active, single-use patch for the treatment of migraines as an alternative to oral drugs, which often have severe side effects, said chief executive officer Jane Hollingsworth. The company hopes to start selling the patch in 2012 if it gains FDA approval. Tarsa Therapeutics, which is based in Philadelphia, is marketing an oral dosage of a drug called Calcitonin for the treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis. Near Neuronetics in Malvern, TetraLogic Pharmaceuticals has been shrinking tumors with proteins, trying to avoid the killing of normal cells that occurs with most cancer treatments. And in Bristol, NB Therapeutics says it believes it has solved the delivery problems for the drug Lamisil, used to treat onychomycosis, a fungal nail infection that affects 35 million people in the United States, CEO Frank McCaney said. Quaker BioVentures is not the only firm investing here. Polaris Venture Partners and Pfizer, which both back early-stage life-science companies, have funded some of these firms, including TetraLogic and Neuronetics. Polaris director Kevin Bitterman said the decision to invest $30 million in Neuronetics was based largely on the fact that this was a ""classic example of a team working in groundbreaking technology."" Quaker BioVentures founding partner Sherrill Neff said his firm ""saw this as a huge opportunity where we could provide safer and more durable treatment in a market which has millions and millions of patients."" The numbers are certainly significant. According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, about 9 percent of U.S. adults have depression, including 3.4 percent with major depression. At the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine, John O'Reardon directs the Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation Program. He also ran a Neuronetics-funded trial that helped the product gain FDA approval in 2008. Penn does not use Neuronetics' unit but does employ the technology, conducting more than 1,500 sessions per year, often on difficult cases. ""We've been pretty satisfied with the results,"" O'Reardon said. ""As a treatment, it has been very effective in major depression, which is where it has FDA approval."" More than 4,000 patients have received NeuroStar treatment since its 2008 debut. Neuronetics does not report sales figures or profits, and NeuroStar is its only product so far. Still, the company says its U.S. employees have risen from 30 to 130 in the last two years. NeuroStar TMS Therapy uses the same technology as MRI machines, which have been widely used around the world. Patients get five sessions a week for four to six weeks, and remain awake during the 37-minute session. The cost varies across the country, but is generally about $350 per session. Most patients undergo 20 to 30 sessions, putting the cost at between $7,000 and $10,500. Psychiatrists themselves pay $70,000 for the system, and Neuronetics provides training and technical support. So far doctors are offering it in Bryn Mawr, Wayne, Huntingdon Valley, Philadelphia, Newtown Square, and Mount Laurel. A full list is at www.neuronetics.com The new treatment is not a panacea. One study found that, of patients who failed to benefit from one antidepressant medication, just one-third responded adequately to a second. TMS produced a similar response rate (as does talk therapy, according to other studies), although the effect was described as greater. Side effects of the treatment include temporary headaches (which were reported by half the patients in one study) and slight discomfort during the actual treatment (reported by a third).",0,story_reviews_01070
"""What we found is that where patients were applying Latisse, especially in areas where the hair was thinner and wispier and less pigmented, the hair grew thicker, stronger and healthier,"" he said. Though some users of Latisse have experienced skin discoloration, Dr. Bauman said he had never seen any such reaction on the scalp of his patients. Certainly, Mr. Paduda, who used Latisse daily from November through February, is a happy customer. By the third week, he said, both he and friends he asked for reactions were seeing results. ""I even busted out the old ‘before' and ‘after' pictures,"" he said. ""It was a noticeable difference."" But Latisse does not appear to be a silver bullet for hair loss. Instead, it appears to work in much the same way as Rogaine or Propecia: All three can strengthen and darken hair that grows from a dying follicle, but none can bring a dead one back to life. The result is an enhanced, refortified hairline rather than a brand new head of hair. Photo Aside from hair transplants, which can cost about $10,000 each and do not always look natural, the only current hope for complete replacement is hair cloning, the act of producing entirely new hair from the DNA of an existing one, which researchers have been attempting, unsuccessfully, for years. A pair of researchers last year claimed to grow new hair by combining plucked hair with a wound-healing powder made by ACell, a regenerative-medicine company in Columbia, Md. Though the claim was met with some skepticism by other clinicians, the idea that ACell's powder, which has been approved by the government, could facilitate new hair growth has breathed new life into the race to clone hair. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Dr. Robert M. Bernstein, clinical professor of dermatology at Columbia University, is now one of several researchers experimenting with the product. ""It's just a question of time now"" before hair cloning becomes a reality, Dr. Bernstein said. ""We keep on moving back that time, but I think there's absolutely no doubt that it's going to be done."" He believes hair cloning will be commercially available within 10 years. This may sound like a long time to wait, but ""it's important to remember that baldness is unlike other conditions where you can progress past the point of being helped,"" Dr. Bernstein said. ""Once we have a cure for hair loss, everyone will be able to benefit."" Photo It has been been 14 years since the F.D.A. approved a new hair-loss remedy (Propecia, in 1997), so it is understandable that anticipation for a new one might be running high. One advantage of Latisse is that it needs to be applied only once a day (Rogaine needs to be applied twice; Propecia is taken once daily), and does not seem to cause reactions in people who are allergic to minoxidil. It is, however, expensive: a month's supply of Latisse can cost up to $150, and that is in amounts appropriate for use merely on the eyelashes. Rogaine, which is also available over the counter now, costs about $25 a month, and a month's supply of Propecia runs about $75. (Even Mr. Paduda has now switched to Propecia, citing cost.) The potential for Latisse is not lost on Allergan. The company initiated a Phase 1 clinical study in August to determine whether bimatoprost can be used as a treatment in men and women suffering from hair loss (alopecia).

For those too impatient to wait, there is also the bold and fashionable solution of shaving one's head. But the fact is that many men — and women — simply do not accept baldness easily. ""Hair has been an evolutionary sign of health and sexuality and youth, and that doesn't change,"" Dr. Bernstein said. ""Shaved heads look cool, but not everyone wants one, and not everyone looks good with one."" Mr. Paduda concurs. ""I have really dark eyebrows,"" he said.

"Swedish Study Finds Surgery For Prostate Cancer Better Than Waiting For men diagnosed with prostate cancer, uncertainty about what to do remains a big problem, despite years of research on the options. Now, a Swedish study suggests that radical prostatectomy — complete removal of the prostate gland — is better than ""watchful waiting"" for the treatment of younger men with low-risk prostate cancer. On the surface, this seems to contradict a U.S. trend toward holding off on surgery and monitoring men who have low-risk cancers with what's called ""active surveillance."" But don't leap to any conclusions. Like every new study of prostate cancer, the results need to be carefully parsed. First, the study results, which appear in this week's New England Journal of Medicine. It's actually an update of a 2008 report, with an additional three years of data on the nearly 700 men who volunteered for the trial up to 15 years ago. All of them had early-stage prostate cancer at the beginning. The study found 38 percent fewer prostate cancer deaths among men randomly assigned to the surgery group versus those in what the Swedes called the watchful-waiting group. Men who had surgery had 41 percent lower risk of their cancer spreading throughout the body, and 66 percent less risk of growth within the prostate. The survival benefits were restricted to men under 65. For this group, surgery saved one life for every seven men who had prostatectomies — considered a favorable ratio. And it applied to men with tumors considered low-risk, meaning they have a relatively low Gleason score, a marker of tumor aggressiveness. ""Our findings show that some tumors that are considered to be low-risk at diagnosis do pose a threat to life, especially if they are not surgically removed,"" the study authors write. So is this a slam-dunk for radical prostatectomy? Game over? Far from it. In an editorial accompanying the study, Dr. Dr. Matthew Smith of Massachusetts General Hospital makes some important points. First, only about 1 in 20 men in the Swedish study had a prostate cancer diagnosis based on a high PSA level. Almost 90 percent had tumors their doctors could feel on digital rectal exams. But in the U.S., most prostate cancers are identified by PSA screening, and less than half have palpable tumors. This is important, because experts believe many prostate tumors found by PSA are likely to be slow-growing — perhaps so slow they will never cause a problem before the man dies of something else. So ""low risk"" in the Swedish study means higher-risk than the current ""low risk"" men diagnosed in the United States. By the way, 9 out of 10 prostate cancers in the U.S. these days is considered low risk. Second, the Swedish study compared radical prostatectomy to watchful waiting. And Smith points out that ""watchful waiting"" does not mean the same thing as ""active surveillance."" ""Watchful waiting means we're not going to treat you now and if you progress clinically, we'll treat you with hormone therapy – not with curative intent,"" Smith tells Shots. ""Active surveillance means observing the patient in a proactive way, with regularly scheduled biopsies,"" he adds. If there's a sign the cancer is progressing, doctors currently would treat with intent to cure, using surgery, radiation or both. Smith makes another point: Both surgical techniques and radiation therapy technology have improved since the Swedish study was done. So there's reason to think men followed with active surveillance and treated when necessary would fare better than the ""watchful waiting"" group in the newly published study. Unfortunately, there haven't been any large studies in which prostatectomy and radiation therapy have been compared in patients with early-stage prostate cancer who have been randomly assigned to one or the other. Two such studies are underway. Results are some years off. But Smith warns against assuming those results will settle the question of how men with early-stage prostate cancer should be treated. ""There will always be questions, and an ongoing need to individualize therapy,"" he says.",0,story_reviews_01104
"The investigators found that the less salt people ate, the more likely they were to die of heart disease — 50 people in the lowest third of salt consumption (2.5 grams of sodium per day) died during the study as compared with 24 in the medium group (3.9 grams of sodium per day) and 10 in the highest salt consumption group (6.0 grams of sodium per day). And while those eating the most salt had, on average, a slight increase in systolic blood pressure — a 1.71-millimeter increase in pressure for each 2.5-gram increase in sodium per day — they were no more likely to develop hypertension. ""If the goal is to prevent hypertension"" with lower sodium consumption, said the lead author, Dr. Jan A. Staessen, a professor of medicine at the University of Leuven, in Belgium, ""this study shows it does not work."" But among the study's other problems, Dr. Briss said, its subjects who seemed to consume the smallest amount of sodium also provided less urine than those consuming more, an indication that they might not have collected all of their urine in an 24-hour period. Dr. Frank Sacks of the Harvard School of Public Health agreed and also said the study was flawed. ""It's a problematic study,"" Dr. Sacks said. ""We shouldn't be guiding any kind of public health decisions on it."" Photo Dr. Michael Alderman, a blood pressure researcher at Albert Einstein College of Medicine and editor of the American Journal of Hypertension, said medical literature on salt and health effects was inconsistent. But, Dr. Alderman said, the new study is not the only one to find adverse effects of low-sodium diets. His own study, with people who had high blood pressure, found that those who ate the least salt were most likely to die. Dr. Alderman said that he once was an unpaid consultant for the Salt Institute but that he now did no consulting for it or for the food industry and did not receive any support or take any money from industry groups. Lowering salt consumption, Dr. Alderman said, has consequences beyond blood pressure. It also, for example, increases insulin resistance, which can increase the risk of heart disease.

One problem with the salt debates, Dr. Alderman said, is that all the studies are inadequate.

"En Español By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, May 4, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Among men under 65 with early stage prostate cancer, those who have the prostate gland removed are less likely to die than those who adopt a ""watchful waiting"" approach, according to a new long-term study out of Europe. But the findings are not likely to be practice-changing, said Dr. Richard E. Greenberg, chief of urologic oncology at Fox Chase Cancer Center in Philadelphia, who was not involved with the study. ""This is relatively early stage disease, and it shows what we would expect it to show: that those who have more years [to live] have better survival if treated aggressively,"" he said. Men with prostate cancer face a confusing maze of options today, including not only surgery but hormone therapy, different kinds of radiation therapy and even simply foregoing medical treatment while monitoring the cancer closely (""watchful waiting,"" also known as ""active surveillance""). ""Watchful waiting"" is often recommended when a man is not expected to die of the cancer and would like to avoid the risk of the debilitating side effects associated with prostate cancer treatment. These may include: incontinence and erectile dysfunction (surgery); erectile dysfunction and secondary cancers (radiation therapy); nausea, breast growth, liver problems (hormonal therapy); and weakness, hair loss, fluid retention (chemotherapy). The data presented in the May 5 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine is a 15-year follow-up of a study for which three-years of follow-up had previously been reported. The earlier study also found that undergoing a radical prostatectomy lowered the risk of the cancer spreading, as well as the death rate from prostate cancer or any other cause. The researchers, Drs. Anna Bill-Axelson and Lars Holmberg of University Hospital, Uppsala, and colleagues, enrolled nearly 700 men with early prostate cancer under the age of 75 who were randomly selected either to undergo a radical prostatectomy or to stay in ""watchful waiting"" mode. After an average follow-up of about 13 years, 14.6 percent of the men who had undergone surgery had died, versus 20.7 percent in the watchful waiting group, a 38 percent reduced risk. The benefit was primarily seen among men younger than 65 and the authors estimated that seven men under the age of 65 and 8 over the age of 65 would need to be treated to save one life. There was also a benefit in men whose tumors had low-risk characteristics. Men whose cancer had moved outside of the prostate gland and who underwent removal of the prostate had a seven times higher risk of dying than men whose tumors hadn't spread. Radical prostatectomy can come with a price -- including erectile dysfunction, urinary incontinence and even bowel incontinence -- although these effects are not as common as techniques improve. A nerve-sparing radical prostatectomy, for example, may be able to prevent erectile dysfunction. Also, the men in this study were diagnosed only after they had symptoms, unlike the majority of men in the United States, Greenberg said. ""The advantage of screening is that men are more likely to be cured of cancer but they also have a greater chance of not succumbing to the consequences of the surgical complications, whether [those] be erectile dysfunction or urinary incontinence,"" Greenberg said. Also, he said, erectile dysfunction can also be a factor of aging and can be treated in most cases. But much remains to be known about how best to treat different types of prostate cancer. ""The management of early stage prostate cancer continues to require further randomized controlled studies, which are underway, to determine the true benefit of treatment versus expectant management,"" said Dr. Marc Danziger, an attending urologist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, who was not involved with the study. ""Currently, the potential benefit and side effects of treatment needs to be addressed on an individual basis in relation to the risk stratification of disease, patient desires, health status and risk tolerance,"" Danziger added.

"Doctors have long encouraged patients to slash their salt intake for good heart health. The American Heart Association encourages people to consume no more than 1,500 milligrams a day of sodium to reduce their risk of high blood pressure, heart attacks, stroke and kidney disease. This is less than half of what people consume now. One reason for this advice: Elevated blood pressure is a major public health problem approximately 90% of all Americans will develop hypertension over their lifetime, the heart association says. But a new European population study coordinated in Belgium raises questions about sodium and its effect on the heart. Researchers followed 3,681 people, average age 40, for about eight years, testing sodium excretion in the urine. They found that systolic blood pressure (the top number) was slightly lower in those who excreted less sodium, but this didn't translate into a lower risk of cardiovascular death — in fact, those with lower sodium excretion had an increased risk of cardiovascular death. The findings were consistent in participants younger and older than 60 years. Jan Staessen, a professor of medicine at the University of Leuven in Belgium and one of the authors of the study in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association, says this study does not support the recommendation of a general reduction of salt intake for everyone, although salt reduction could be beneficial in lowering the blood pressure of people with hypertension. ""Lower sodium intake is recommended for people with high blood pressure and people with heart failure, but recommending it to the population as a whole, I wouldn't do without proving it's completely safe,"" he says. ""If one lowers sodium intake to lower blood pressure, this change in sodium activates several systems (including the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system) that conserve sodium, and those systems are implicated in disease processes such as damaging the arterial wall and kidneys,"" Staessen says, This study may apply to Americans of white European descent, but it might less applicable to blacks because they are believed to be more salt sensitive, he says. The research is already drawing fire from medical experts here. Ralph Sacco, president of the American Heart Association and chairman of neurology at the University of Miami, says this is only one study of a relatively young, mostly white population and blood pressure tends to rise with age and affect African-Americans disproportionately. ""We have based our recommendations on the many scientific studies which show a strong relationship between reduced sodium consumption and a lower risk of heart attacks, congestive heart failure and stroke,"" he says. ""There are good randomized, controlled studies the gold standard of scientific studies that show a lower sodium diet has a meaningful effect on blood pressure."" Gina Lundberg, a preventive cardiologist in Atlanta, supports the 1,500-milligram guideline. ""We're all eating too much sodium because we eat too many prepared, processed foods."" Leaders in the salt industry applaud the new research. This study basically says that salt reduction to reduce cardiovascular disease is a strategy that is not going to work, says Morton Satin, vice president of science and research for the Salt Institute, an industry group.",0,story_reviews_01109
"(CNN) -- The use of mammograms has dipped since a medical task force made controversial recommendations that women in their 40s may not need to get breast cancer screenings every year, according to one of three small studies to be presented Monday. The studies related to this topic will be presented at the American Roentgen Ray Society annual meeting. They do not appear in peer-reviewed journals. The studies suggest that fewer physicians are recommending annual mammograms for women in their 40s, fewer patients in that age group are getting screened and that tumors found through routine mammography are more likely to be detected in early stages of cancer. The studies examined the impact of the controversial guidelines issued by the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, a federal advisory board. Who decides about mammograms? Inside the task force In November 2009, the group stated that yearly mammograms should not be automatic at age 40 and that physicians should discuss their risks and benefits with their patients. It recommended routine mammography screenings every two years for women ages 50 to 74. ""The benefit in 40- to 49-year-old women is pretty small,"" said Dr. Virginia Moyer, chair of the task force, about annual mammograms. ""There is a real, but rather modest benefit. There are also risks, and they are greater in younger women than older women."" Mammograms are less effective in detecting growths in younger women, whose breasts may be denser. The screening gets better with older women because breast tissues change over time. As a result, some women experience false positives, anxiety and unnecessary biopsies because of mammograms, according to data. Roughly 15% of women in their 40s detect breast cancer through mammography. Should I get a mammogram? ""The benefit is modest enough it needs to be an individual decision,"" Moyer said about mammograms for women in their 40s. This contradicted advice from cancer groups such as the American Cancer Society and Susan G. Komen for the Cure, which told women 40 and older to get screened every year. It sparked immediate outcry from such groups and cancer survivors, who say routine mammograms for women younger than 50 can save lives. Once-dropping U.S. breast cancer rates now stable Suspicious growths caught in regular-screening mammograms are more likely to be in early stages and therefore more treatable, said Dr. Donna Plecha, division chief of mammography at University Hospitals at Case Medical Center in Ohio. She reviewed records of 524 biopsies (samples of suspicious growths in breasts) from women in their 40s during 2008 to 2009 at her hospital. Of the 359 biopsies from screening mammography patients, 15% had cancer. These cancers were more treatable because they were caught in earlier stages, Plecha said. Although 85% of those biopsies turned out to be noncancerous, some ""may show us the patient is at higher risk of breast cancer,"" she said. ""I haven't met many patients who don't appreciate us being thorough, to trying to find the cancers at an early stage,"" Plecha said. ""I would still recommend screening mammograms starting at age of 40,"" because cancers caught earlier would be more curable. Breast cancer ID'd more accurately by docs who see more scans Plecha's findings were not surprising to Moyer. It's obvious that annual screenings would catch cancers before they progress, she said. The study presumes that catching earlier stages for women between the ages of 40-49 would translate into fewer breast cancer deaths. ""The data that we have suggests that 1 in a thousand will benefit from mammograms in the 40-49 age,"" she said. ""There are whole lots of assumptions that are not supported by the data they presented."" The task force did not say don't get mammograms, Moyer said. ""It might make women not want to get the test,"" she said. ""This is a decision that should belong to the woman with appropriate info on hand."" In another study, Dr. Lara Hardesty, section chief of breast imaging at the University of Colorado Hospital, examined survey results from fewer than 50 internists, gynecologists, family practitioners and nurse midwives. She found that fewer clinicians were recommending annual mammograms after the task force's guidelines were issued. Before the guidelines, 56% recommended yearly mammograms for women in the 40- to 49-year-old range. After the guidelines, that rate decreased to 20%, and 56% of the clinicians reported they were discussing the risks and benefits of screening with patients. That decrease, Hardesty said, ""is a statistically significant difference,"" but it also showed more doctors were discussing mammograms with patients. Hardesty also found that there were 205 fewer mammograms among women in their 40s after the guidelines were issued. Among patients 50 and older, mammograms increased slightly from 4,479 patients to 4,498. It was unclear why mammograms in the 40s decreased while older women's mammograms increased slightly. Hardesty offered this hypothesis: Older women are used to having annual mammograms because they've done it for years. Meanwhile, younger women may feel as though they don't have to get this screening. Although the task force concluded that the net benefit of mammography in the 40s is small, Hardesty said: ""If you're the one person we find your cancer, it's the world to you.""",0,story_reviews_01112
"Tai Chi, A 'Medication In Motion,' Helps People With Heart Failure Enlarge this image toggle caption Robert F. Bukaty/AP Robert F. Bukaty/AP Visit an urban park in China any given morning or late afternoon, and you're likely to find elderly people engaged in a slow, elegant dance, their arms and legs lifting and circling in unison. Tinny traditional music might be playing from a battery-run cassette player. The seniors are focused and at ease in their daily ritual, and it's soothing to watch them. The movement is tai chi, an ancient martial art turned exercise, and a study out this week in Archives of Internal Medicine says it may help people suffering from heart failure feel better about life. In a quality of life questionnaire the researchers gave out, those who practiced tai chi scored significantly higher than those who hadn't been doing the movement. The tai chi group also reported an improvement in mood. Heart failure is a tough disease to live with; the shortness of breath and low energy that can come because the heart can't pump enough blood make physical activity unappealing. ""Historically, patients with chronic systolic heart failure were considered too frail to exercise and, through the late 1980s, avoidance of physical activity was a standard recommendation,"" the study's authors write. The Chinese developed tai chi thousands of years ago, but it has recently piqued the interest of Western medicine as an alternative mind-body therapy to treat disease. According to a Harvard Medical School newsletter, tai chi is increasingly seen as a form of 'medication in motion.' It's been shown to be useful in treating a wide range of diseases from breast cancer to Parkinson's. The National Institutes of Health has also jumped on board and is funding a variety of studies on tai chi for chronic disease. The Archives of Internal Medicine study is the first large clinical trial to look at whether a tai chi program can do anything for people with heart failure. The researchers recruited 100 people with the chronic condition from heart clinics in Boston. About half were randomly assigned to receive a 12-week tai chi exercise program. The other half got a heart health education program. The tai chi program started off with some traditional warm-up exercises of arm swinging, gentle stretches, breathing, and visualization techniques. Then patients learned five simple movements designed to release tension in the body, increase awareness of breathing, and relax the body and mind. Patients got an instructional video tape, and were encouraged to practice at home at least 3 times a week. The study authors say there's a usually a strong relationship between depression and heart failure, so the fact that tai chi helped cheer people up was an especially good sign.",0,story_reviews_01117
"John Jeffries, a 49-year-old money manager in Dover, Mass., had hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008 and is now coaching his son's basketball team and long-distance cycling. Alex Douglas, a Wall Street software architect, had both knees replaced last year at 39 after years of sports injuries. He can't wait to go kite-boarding this weekend. ""I've been cleared to have fun,"" he says. Joint-replacement patients these days are younger and more active than ever before. More than half of all hip-replacement surgeries performed this year are expected to be on people under 65, with the same percentage projected for knee replacements by 2016. The fastest-growing group is patients 46 to 64, according to the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgery. Many active middle-agers are wearing out their joints with marathons, triathlons, basketball and tennis and suffering osteoarthritis years earlier than previous generations. They're also determined to stay active for many more years and not let pain or disability make them sedentary. To accommodate them, implant makers are working to build joints with longer-wearing materials, and surgeons are offering more options like partial knee replacements, hip resurfacing and minimally invasive procedures. More younger people also need joint-replacement surgery due to obesity, and some orthopedists refer them for weight-loss surgery first to reduce complications later. Even the most fit patients face a long period of rehabilitation after surgery and may not be able to resume high-impact activities. ""There is, to be honest, some irrational exuberance out there,"" says Daniel Berry, chief of orthopedic surgery at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester, Minn., and president of the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. ""People may be overly optimistic about what joint replacement can do for them."" One big unknown: How long will the replacement joints last? In the past, many doctors assumed implants would wear out in about 10 or 15 years, and they urged young patients to put off surgery as long as possible to minimize the risk of needing a costly and difficult revision surgery—or even two. (A total knee replacement typically costs $15,000 to $22,000. A revision can be $45,000 or more, with a higher risk of complications.) John Jeffries, 49, had his hip resurfaced in 2008. Dominick Reuter for The Wall Street Journal Steven Haas, chief of the knee service at the Hospital for Special Surgery in New York City, says he frequently sees young patients who are in too much pain to play with their kids, take walks, work or enjoy traveling. ""To them, the idea of being miserable in their 50s so they might not need another surgery in their 70s doesn't make much sense,"" he says. Several studies of hips and knees implanted in patients long ago have found that 85% to 90% are still functioning well after 20 years. Advances in wear-resistant materials may make implants being used today last even longer. For example, many hips and knees use a combination of metal and polyethylene parts, and continuous motion can wear away small polyethylene particles. Scientists have found that irradiating the polyethylene removes free oxygen radicals that contribute to degradation, so the polyethylene components are expected to wear much longer. ""Metal-on-metal"" hip parts were supposed to wear better than plastic, but their use is declining due to concerns that they can release metal ions into patients' bloodstreams and cause soft-tissue damage. Hip implants made with ""ceramic-on-ceramic"" components have a disconcerting tendency to squeak. Last year, one manufacturer, Smith & Nephew, won clearance from the Food and Drug Administration to market its latest technology as a ""30-year knee"" based on tests mimicking 30 years of wear. Still, there are no long-term data on how any of the latest implants will fare in actual patients. ""We have to install them and see,"" says Robert Namba, an orthopedic surgeon with Kaiser Permanente in Irvine, Calif. The biggest variable is patients themselves. As a rule, the more active they are, the faster their joints will wear out, loosen or require revision. Most orthopedic surgeons encourage patients with hip and knee implants to walk, swim and cycle as much as possible. Golf and doubles tennis are acceptable. But jogging, running, jumping and singles tennis are out. ""If your goal is a 30-year knee, you need to avoid high-impact sports,"" says John Wright, an orthopedic surgeon at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. That said, some patients are determined to push the envelope, and some doctors give their blessing. ""If you have a brand new sports car and leave it in the garage, it will last forever and you won't have any fun,"" says Thomas Schmalzried, an orthopedic surgeon at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los Angeles. A former college basketball player, Dr. Schmalzried has patients who play competitive sports and run marathons with artificial joints. ""I know that the technology is capable of this level of athletic function. What I don't know—what nobody knows—is where the lines are for the average patient."" Some doctors compromise and tell patients they can ski and surf if they were good at it before surgery, (and as long as they avoid skiing moguls). ""There's a happy medium, and it's not necessarily the same for every patient,"" says Dr. Berry. ""One might say, 'I'm willing to take a risk because that activity is important to me,' and another might not."" Personal quality of life issues are also important in deciding whether—and when—a patient is ready for joint-replacement surgery. ""It got to the point where I couldn't get on my motorcycle anymore,"" says Paul Canter, a picture framer from Los Angeles who had a double hip replacement at 63 last year. Chris Schubert was kicked by a horse when she was 25, then suffered a near-fatal staph infection from a cortisone shot. Mounting pain and inflammation over the next 14 years forced her to quit recreational horseback riding, interrupted her sleep and interfered with her work as a building contractor. She had minimally invasive knee replacement surgery with Dr. Haas last year, at age 38, and her pain and limitations are gone. ""I thought my path in life was set and I'd just be miserable,"" she says. ""I never imagined my life could be this wonderful."" Patients say that regaining function after surgery requires enormous mental and physical effort. ""Pre-hab""—building up strength before the surgery—is just as important as re-hab afterward, they say. ""I was in the best shape of my life before I went in for the surgery,"" says Mr. Jeffries, the money manager, who trained twice a day for six months before his hip-resurfacing surgery in 2008. And staying as fit and strong as possible is also critical to joint preservation. ""I made up my mind. If I was going to go through all this surgery and rehab, I wanted to make these hips last as long as they possibly can,"" says Carol Espel, 55, an executive of Equinox Fitness who damaged both hips dancing professionally and teaching fitness for years. Now she takes classes in cycling, yoga, Pilates and strength training weekly. ""No impact ever,"" she says. Mark Liszt, the owner of a wholesale meat company in Los Angeles who had double knee replacement surgery in 2008 at the age of 60, says the first five months of rehab were very painful and discouraging. ""You're fighting to get range of motion back. You're fighting to break adhesions. You're fighting depression and you're wondering, 'Is an era of your life over?' "" But he worked through the pain and was back playing basketball a few months later. Now 63, he still plays basketball twice a week. The surgery, he says, ""gave me my life back. I can pivot. I can do a hook shot. And I am completely pain free."" Write to Melinda Beck at HealthJournal@wsj.com",0,story_reviews_01122
"LONDON (Reuters) - Taking cholesterol-lowering statin drugs such as Pfizer's Lipitor and AstraZeneca's Crestor could help prevent people dying from pneumonia, according to a study by British scientists released on Tuesday. Researchers from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine found that the risk of death in the six-month period after being diagnosed with pneumonia was substantially lower among those who were already taking the cholesterol-lowering drugs than in those who were not. Previous studies have suggested statins, which are also available as cheaper generics, may be linked to better outcomes after bacterial infection. These findings suggest the pills may help protect against death in patients with pneumonia. Statins such as Lipitor, Crestor, and a generic called simvastatin are widely prescribed to lower so-called ""bad"" or LDL cholesterol — a risk factor for heart disease — and are credited with being among the most successful drugs in helping to prevent heart attacks and strokes. Separate research published in March found that lowering cholesterol levels could help the body's immune system fight infections, a finding that appears to be supported by Tuesday's study. ""Statins are safe, cheap, and an easy intervention in terms of delivery,"" said Ian Douglas, a lecturer in epidemiology at the LSHTM who led the research. ""Given the potential low number needed to treat to prevent a death suggested by this study, we believe that a strong case exists for randomized trials of statins in people with serious infection to determine if a simple and practical intervention at the point of diagnosis of pneumonia has a beneficial effect."" Douglas's team, whose research was published in the British Medical Journal, used data from computerized medical records of doctors' practices in Britain to identify statin users. They then matched each statin user — who was aged over 40 when first prescribed a statin between 1995 and 2006 — with up to five non-statin users for comparison. Patients with a record of pneumonia were followed for six months to see if they died, and the researchers found that 13 percent (109 out of 847) of statin users died compared with 20 percent (578 out of 2,927) of non-statin users. Douglas noted that since this study looked at patients who were already taking statins when they developed pneumonia, a full randomized clinical trial was needed to find out whether starting a statin at the time of diagnosis has a similar effect.",0,story_reviews_01138
"April 4, 2011 -- Preventing pancreatic cancer may be an additional health benefit of using aspirin to treat everyday aches and pains or prevent heart disease. A new study shows people who took aspirin at least once a month were 29% less likely to develop pancreatic cancer than those who used other types of pain relievers or nothing at all. Researchers also found people who regularly take low-dose aspirin to reduce their risk of heart disease had a 35% lower risk of pancreatic cancer. But researchers are quick to point out that aspirin may not be for everyone, and these results need to be confirmed by further studies. The study shows an association but is not designed to show cause and effect. ""The results are not meant to suggest everyone should start taking aspirin once monthly to reduce their risk of pancreatic cancer,"" says researcher Xiang-Lin Tan, of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minn., in a news release. ""Individuals should discuss use of aspirin with their physicians because the drug carries some side effects.""",0,story_reviews_01139
"Ron Wurzer for The New York Times In a finding that challenges the conventional wisdom about the risks of some hormones used in menopause, a major government study has found that years after using estrogen-only therapy, certain women had a markedly reduced risk of breast cancer and heart attack. The research, part of the landmark Women's Health Initiative study, is likely to surprise women and their doctors, who for years have heard frightening news about the risks of hormone therapy. But most of those fears are related to the use of a combination of two hormones, estrogen and progestin, which are prescribed to relieve hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, and have been shown to increase a woman's risk of breast cancer. The new findings, reported Tuesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association, come from 10,739 women in the Women's Health Initiative study who had previously had a hysterectomy, the surgical removal of the uterus. Nationwide, about one-third of women in their 50s have had a hysterectomy. The Women's Health Initiative was begun in 1991 by the National Institutes of Health as a sweeping investigation of hormone use and other health issues of postmenopausal women. While most women in the hormone study were taking combination hormone therapy, women without a uterus took estrogen alone or a placebo for about six years and were followed for nearly 11 years. The estrogen-only group was not given progestin, which is prescribed only to protect the uterus from the harmful effects of estrogen. Although all the women in the estrogen study stopped using the treatment in 2004, the investigators have continued to monitor their health, as is typical in large clinical trials. The most surprising new finding relates to breast cancer. The women with hysterectomies who used estrogen alone had a 23 percent lower risk for breast cancer compared with those who had taken a placebo. This is in stark contrast to the higher risk of breast cancer shown in the estrogen-progestin part of the trial. ""The decreased risk of breast cancer in this group is something we totally didn't expect when we started the W.H.I. hormone therapy trials,"" said Andrea Z. LaCroix, the study's lead author and a professor of epidemiology at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center in Seattle. ""This study differentiates estrogen alone from estrogen and progestin in a very big way. I hope it gets across to women, because we are not reversing ourselves."" Indeed, the investigators emphasized that the results do not change recommendations concerning combination hormone therapy for the two-thirds of menopausal women who still have a uterus. The Women's Health Initiative data have consistently shown that the combination of estrogen and progestin raises breast cancer risk, and that the treatment should be used only to relieve severe menopause symptoms, using the lowest dose for the shortest possible time. But the data are reassuring for millions of middle-aged women without a uterus who take estrogen to relieve hot flashes and other menopause symptoms. An accompanying editorial in the journal was skeptical about the results, arguing that the design of the initiative, which is skewed toward older women and stopped all forms of hormone treatment after several years of use, does not match the way doctors typically prescribe treatment to women in their 50s at the onset of menopause. Dr. Graham Colditz, an author of the editorial and professor of surgery at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, said he thought data collected from observational studies that show a higher risk of breast cancer associated with estrogen use were more reliable than the data gathered from the Women's Health Initiative clinical trial. ""The finding doesn't reflect how hormones are used in the U.S. at the moment,"" Dr. Colditz said. The trial has, however, been held up for years as the gold standard for medical research, and its findings linking combination hormones to breast cancer and heart problems led to significant changes in the way doctors around the world treated menopause. A major caveat in interpreting the new estrogen data is that the study used conjugated equine estrogens, which are estrogen compounds derived from the urine of pregnant mares and marketed by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals under the brand Premarin. The brand has fallen out of favor with many women who are choosing treatments that contain estradiol, which is chemically similar to a woman's natural estrogen. It is not known whether the benefits of estrogen shown in the Women's Health Initiative would be replicated using a different type of estrogen. Nobody knows why estrogen treatment alone appeared to lower breast cancer risk in the study, but one explanation may be that in menopausal women with low levels of natural estrogen, the effects of estrogen drugs induce cell death in existing tumors. Nobody is suggesting that women start using estrogen to prevent breast cancer, but the finding opens a potentially new avenue of research in the prevention of the disease. ""We need to look closely at these findings to see if we can learn more about ways to prevent breast cancer in women,"" said Dr. JoAnn Manson, a Women's Health Initiative investigator and an author of the study who is chief of preventive medicine at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston. In the final analysis of the estrogen-only trial, use of the hormone was not associated with any significant risks or benefits pertaining to blood clots, stroke, hip fracture, colon cancer or overall death rates. But there were surprising differences in the risks and benefits of estrogen use on heart risk when comparing the youngest and oldest women in the study. Women who were in their 50s when they first started using estrogen also had significantly fewer heart risks, including almost 50 percent fewer heart attacks, compared with those assigned to the placebo group. The data indicate that for every 10,000 women in their 50s, those using estrogen would experience 12 fewer heart attacks, 13 fewer deaths and 18 fewer adverse events like blood clots or stroke in a given year, compared with those taking a placebo. But the risks of estrogen use were pronounced in older women. For every 10,000 women in their 70s, using estrogen would cause 16 extra heart attacks, 19 extra deaths and 48 serious adverse events. ""The big message there is that the data look much more favorable for younger women and much riskier for older women,"" said Dr. LaCroix. Dr. Rowan Chlebowski, another author of the study and a medical oncologist at Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute, said the findings underscored the fact that the risks and benefits of menopause hormones change depending on a woman's health status, her age and the type of hormone used. Dr. Chlebowski previously led research that showed cancer risks associated with combination hormone therapy, but he says the new data on estrogen alone show that in certain women, estrogen use to relieve menopausal symptoms is a ""good choice."" ""When you look at the debate, people are saying hormones are good or not good — it's been all or nothing. This calls attention to the fact that there are differences,"" Dr. Chlebowski said. ""I hope that separation will become clearer now."" This article appeared in print on Wednesday, April 6, 2011 on page A1.",0,story_reviews_01140
"Next time your fussy, colicky baby has you teetering on the brink of sleep-deprived lunacy, consider a cup of herbal tea. And that's for the baby, not for you. Tea --made with chamomile, licorice, fennel and balm mint-- was one of the most effective treatments for relieving symptoms of colic, according to a new Pediatrics study, which reviewed 15 randomized clinical trials of alternative treatments for infantile colic. The study analyzed trials that included various types of treatment and found the most encouraging results came from treatments using herbal remedies and sugar solutions, while the least effective results came from treatments involving manipulation and probiotic supplements. Of the three herbal studies, one with the most significant results was when babies were given fennel extract. (No surprise since fennel seeds are known to be a natural digestive aid because they relax the smooth muscle lining of the digestive tract and also help to expel gas.) Another study looked at Colimil, an herbal formula containing fennel, lemon balm, and German chamomile, which after use showed a significant difference in crying times per day. Five studies that looked at glucose and sucrose supplements found significant easing effects on colic symptoms, too. Perhaps the most interesting part of the study is how the authors explain what many a frazzled parent already knows – that it's hard to know how to treat colic because colic itself is such a wily beast. The difficulty in finding an effective treatment is related to our lack of understand of IC (infantile colic). Its pathophysiology is unclear; food allergies, formula intolerance, immaturity of gastrointestinal tract, excessive gas formation or intestinal cramping have all been suggested as possible etiologies. Arguably, any rational treatment should be directed at the mechanisms of the disease itself. The study didn't include specific instructions on dosage, so check with your pediatrician before trying any herbal remedy. And, even then, don't give your baby hot tea!

"Whether you've been relatively inactive or fairly athletic, age is the enemy of one of the most important sets of muscles in the body: the group of four known as the rotator cuff that surround the ball of the shoulder joint. About 54% of adults older than 60 have a completely or partially torn rotator cuff, compared with just 4% of those between 40 and 60. But tears are most frequently caused by degeneration of the tendon due to age, rather than injury from sports or trauma. Studies show that tears can be managed without surgery in half of patients, mainly through physical therapy, pain medications, and avoiding activities that cause pain. But one's strength tends not to improve without surgery to reattach tendons to the ball of the shoulder joint. So, the question for many patients who want to have full use of their shoulder is less whether to have surgery than when and how. In a recent review in the Annals of Internal Medicine, researchers noted that patients and doctors struggle with when to stop nonoperative treatment in favor of surgery, but that repairing a tear earlier rather than later may result in better patient outcomes, earlier return to work and lower costs. The Price of Delay ""Many patients who have a tear figure they can take six months and live with it, but left alone the tear will progress and you can get to the point where it is irreparable,"" says David Altchek, a surgeon at New York's Hospital for Special Surgery. Dr. Altchek says repairing torn rotator cuffs earlier with a new technique that uses a double row of sutures to fix tendons to bone, rather than a single row, is improving healing rates in his studies. While some tears may never worsen or need surgery, says Ken Yamaguchi, an orthopedic surgeon at the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, ""the older somebody is when they get a repair, the less likely it is for the repair to heal."" The good news is that surgery results in reduced pain and improved function in 80% to 95% of patients. And open surgery with big incisions is being replaced by new, less-invasive techniques known as mini-open and arthroscopic repair, which involve less pain and blood loss, shorter hospital stays and a generally easier rehabilitation period, according to the American Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons. Ask Your Doctor The academy, which recently updated its guidelines for rotator-cuff repair, doesn't recommend for or against a specific technique for surgery. Dr. Yamaguchi, vice chairman of a working group that developed the guidelines, says there isn't enough high-quality evidence to recommend any specific technique, a conclusion also reached by the Annals of Internal Medicine researchers. He advises that patients confer with surgeons about their options. The most common procedure is mini-open repair, which uses a smaller incision than traditional open repair. To remove any bone spurs, a surgeon uses arthroscopic, pencil-size instruments to magnify and illuminate the structures inside the joint. Once that is completed, the surgeon repairs the rotator cuff through the small incision. But some surgeons are now performing the entire operation using the small camera-guided instruments, in what's known as an all-arthroscopic procedure. There are possible complications with all surgical procedures, of course. An Academy of Orthopedic Surgeons review of about 40 published studies showed that as many as 2% of patients have nerve injuries, while 1% may get an infection at the surgical site. About 6% may have a tendon re-tear, though that doesn't mean a repeat surgery will be needed or that pain and poor function will result. Lengthy Recovery And as with any surgery, postoperative recovery depends largely on how well patients adhere to their physical-therapy regimens. Initially, that means being extra careful: A repair needs to be protected until the tendon heals strongly to the bone. Patients may be advised to use a sling for the first four to six weeks after surgery and to limit active use of the arm. Therapy usually starts with passive-motion exercises, then range-of-motion exercises continue during the next six to 12 weeks. It can take as long as six months after surgery to return to a functional range of motion and adequate strength. Eric Taylor, a 62-year-old documentary filmmaker who plays sports like tennis with his right arm, says he was surprised when he began developing pain in his left shoulder. He tried to ease it by doing yoga, but after six months with no relief, he scheduled an MRI. It confirmed that a bone spur digging into a tendon had caused a tear in the left rotator cuff. He scheduled surgery with Dr. Altchek at the Hospital for Special Surgery last June, but wishes he had acted sooner. Because he waited so long, he says, his surgery required three incisions instead of one. He was surprised at how much work was involved in rehabilitation but has been diligent about his recovery and physical therapy. Back to playing tennis now, Mr. Taylor says, ""When it comes to our own bodies, as baby boomers we've always been active, and we are going to stay active any way we can.""

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Hormone replacement therapy may work slightly better than soy at reducing menopausal hot flashes, a new study says. Women who took such hormones had fewer hot flashes, on average, than women who took soy - and both had fewer than those who took a placebo, or ""dummy pill."" ""The bottom line for someone who is very disturbed by hot flashes, the best treatment is hormones, and the next tier would be soy,"" said Dr. Gloria Bachmann, professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School in New Jersey. However, a 2002 landmark study by the National Institutes of Health (NIH) found that such treatments can increase the risk of breast cancer, heart disease and stroke. That means that if women do take hormones, Bachmann told Reuters Health, it should be the lowest dose and for the shortest possible period of time. And not every woman needs treatment, notes Bachmann, who was not involved in the study. Women with severe or frequent hot flashes or whose hot flashes keep them up at night, should consider treatment, she said. Women typically suffer between 30 and 150 hot flashes a month, said Dr. Rafael Bolanos-Diaz, professor of health economics at San Marcos University in Lima, Peru, who co-authored the study. Women who took hormones had an average of 24 fewer hot flashes per month, while those who took soy had 12 per month fewer. The study did not look at whether eating soy in food has the same effect on hot flashes as supplements, Bolanos-Diaz said. The researchers looked at 19 studies on how a treatment, either hormones or soy, compared to a placebo. They compared the average number of hot flashes in 760 women who had treatment with 770 who did not. The study was published in Menopause: The Journal of the North American Menopause Society. Soy hasn't been studied as much as hormone replacement to treat hot flashes, and doctors don't know exactly how it works. It's thought to have similar effects to estrogen on the brain, bones, and blood vessels, Bolanos-Diaz told Reuters Health by email. Soy supplements also have side effects: Nausea, bloating, and constipation, according to the NIH. A month's supply costs about $12, while a month of hormone tablets runs between $40 and $60. ""For some women, hormone therapy is the best option, for some soy is best, and for some, it's just watchful waiting until the hot flashes subside,"" Bachmann said.

"Say Aaa! Then Zzz: Tonsillectomy Helps Kids Sleep toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR Getting your tonsils out used to be just part of childhood — a rite of passage for children in the 1950s and '60s. Then it fell out of favor. But tonsillectomy is back. Today, the most common reason for the surgery is ""sleep disordered breathing,"" a broad diagnosis that includes sleep apnea and snoring. About 10 percent of elementary-school-age children snore. Doctors say snoring can cause bed-wetting, behavior problems, short stature and poor school performance. That's a far cry from the 1950s and '60s, when tonsillectomy was used to fight frequent sore throats. Back then, it was the most popular surgery in the United States. In the 1960s sitcom Leave It to Beaver, Beaver Cleaver was so impressed by his dad's tales of ice cream and pretty nurses that he schemed to have his tonsils out, even though he didn't need it. Turning Point For Tonsillectomies It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections. People were growing up with their tonsils. The tonsils are two glands that sit at the base of the tongue and are part of the body's immune system. The premise of tonsillectomies, back in their heyday, was that tonsils get infected themselves and no longer help fend off germs. Then doctors started noticing that kids were still getting sore throats, even after having their tonsils taken out. But it wasn't until clinical trials were completed in the early 1980s that there was proof that tonsillectomy really only helped children with severe, recurrent throat infections. ""It was becoming unacceptable to just take tonsils out because they were there or you had a few infections,"" says Richard Rosenfeld, an ear, nose and throat doctor at SUNY Downstate in Brooklyn, N.Y. ""People were growing up with their tonsils."" But growing up with tonsils can create another problem: snoring. Lisa Moran of Takoma Park, Md., remembers what it sounded like when her son ,Tyler Scorza, now age 7, slept. Enlarge this image toggle caption Maggie Starbard/NPR Maggie Starbard/NPR ""It was loud,"" Moran says. ""You could hear him through he closed door, down the hall, snoring, and he would occasionally stop breathing."" At first, Tyler's pediatrician thought he'd outgrow the snoring. But he wasn't sleeping well and often didn't have any energy. The doctor recommended a head X-Ray, and the radiologist said that though Tyler's adenoids were enlarged, they weren't that bad. By then, Tyler had been dealing with this for almost three years. He started getting frequent nasal infections. So his parents took him to an ear, nose and throat doctor. He said, sure, the adenoids are swollen. ""But the real problem is the tonsils!"" Moran recalls. ""He showed us on the X-ray that there was a tiny passage between the tonsils and the back of his throat — very small."" Enlarged tonsils (and adenoids) are the most common cause of sleep-disordered breathing in children. So the doctor recommended tonsillectomy. Complications From Surgery But Tyler's parents were worried about the surgery. It's usually done as an outpatient procedure now, but with general anesthesia. That's never without some risk. ""Your child is under,"" says Moran, ""completely under. This is not a local."" Other complications include pain after surgery and the risk of bleeding; about 4 percent of people have complications that require readmission to the hospital. Despite hundreds of studies, there's still surprisingly little research on whether tonsillectomy really helps reduce the risk of sore throats. The operation continues to be controversial. What's A Sleep Study? Sleep studies are a way for doctors to diagnose sleep disorders like apnea by observing patients overnight while they sleep. During a sleep study, the patient is connected to an array of sensors monitoring brainwaves, eye movements, heart rate, breathing and blood-oxygen levels. This information, called a polysomnogram, lets doctors see whether the patient has stopped breathing and for how long. Apnea in adults happens when 10 seconds pass without breathing; for children, it's a disruption of two cycles of inhaling and exhaling. Some patients can also use portable sleep monitors to record what's happening in their sleep as an alternative to the sleep study, but that approach is not as comprehensive. Many sleep disorders can be diagnosed without costly sleep studies, which can run anywhere from $600 to several-thousand dollars. More children are undergoing sleep studies as awareness of the condition — particularly in children — rises. The American Academy of Sleep Medicine says about 2 percent of children have obstructive sleep apnea. Before a sleep study is ordered, doctors typically ask for medical and sleep histories and a physical exam. — Eliza Barclay No less a personage than President Obama dissed tonsillectomy when he was stumping for health care overhaul in July 2009. In a prime time news conference, Obama said that doctors may think: "" 'You know what? I make a lot more money if I take this kid's tonsils out.' "" Rosenfeld disputes Obama's claim, saying insurers usually pay a surgeon $200 to $300 for tonsil surgery. Sleep Study Before Tonsillectomy The picture is further clouded because not all children with big tonsils have sleep-disordered breathing or frequent throat infections. Because of that, in 2002 the American Academy of Pediatrics recommended that children have a sleep study before surgery is considered. About 530,000 tonsillectomies are performed in the United States each year. Obviously, parents could use some help in deciding whether surgery is needed. In January, the American Academy of Otolaryngology issued its first guidelines on tonsillectomy in children. With sore throats, the ENTs recommend waiting (and treatment with antibiotics, if needed), unless a child has more than seven infections in a year. They'd recommend surgery if a child has five or more throat infections a year for two years, or three or more in three years. There have been very few randomized studies on the effects of tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing. Most of the researchers have asked parents or children whether they noticed improvements, and looked at a single measure, like behavior or quality of life. Still, the ENTs recommend tonsillectomy for sleep-disordered breathing, saying it reduces symptoms in most children. Tyler's family decided to go ahead with the surgery; they went to the hospital at 5 a.m., and Tyler was home by noon. The doctors said he would be out of school for a week, but a throat infection kept him home a second week. His classmates sent him get-well cards. A year later, Tyler is feeling great. And his snoring is gone. ""Completely gone,"" his mom says. ""You can hear a pin-drop quiet when he sleeps."" Tyler still hears snoring at night, he says. But he knows that the culprit is not him, or the family dog. It's Dad.",0,story_reviews_01168
"CHICAGO – Was your kid born to be an elite athlete? Marketers of genetic tests claim the answer is in mail-order kits costing less than $200. Some customers say the test results help them steer their children to appropriate sports. But skeptical doctors and ethicists say the tests are putting profit before science and have a much greater price tag — potentially robbing perfectly capable youngsters of a chance to enjoy activities of their choice. ""In the `winning is everything' sports culture, societal pressure to use these tests in children may increasingly present a challenge to unsuspecting physicians,"" according to a commentary in Wednesday's Journal of the American Medical Association. Scientists have identified several genes that may play a role in determining strength, speed and other aspects of athletic performance. But there are likely hundreds more, plus many other traits and experiences that help determine athletic ability, said Dr. Alison Brooks, a pediatrician and sports medicine specialist at the University of Wisconsin in Madison. Brooks and University of Michigan physician Dr. Beth Tarini wrote the commentary to raise awareness about the issue. A handful of companies are selling these tests online. In some cases, the tests screen for genes that are common even among non-athletes. As science advances, Brooks said, ""My guess is we're going to see more of this, not less."" Bradley Marston of Bountiful, Utah, bought a test online a year ago for his daughter Elizabeth, then 9. She's ""a very talented soccer player,"" and Marston wanted to know if she had a variation of a gene called ACTN3, which influences production of a protein involved in certain muscle activity. One form of the gene has been linked with explosive bursts of strength needed for activities such as sprinting and weight lifting. The ACTN3 test sold by Atlas Sports Genetics was developed by Genetic Technologies Limited, an Australian firm. Atlas' $169 kit consists of two swabs to scrape cells from the inside of the cheek. Customers return the used swabs to the Boulder, Colo., company and receive an analysis several days later. Elizabeth Marston's test showed she has a sprinting-related gene form — results her father hopes will help her get into elite sports programs or win a sports scholarship to college. Marston said he ordered the test partly out of curiosity, but approached it cautiously and talked with Elizabeth to make sure she could handle it. ""She told me, `Well, Daddy, I just have to try harder'"" if the results came back negative, Marston said. Elizabeth has loved soccer since age 4 and said she's happy with the results. But even at age 10, she knows it will take more than genes to reach her goal of playing in the Olympics. ""I think I would have to train hard,"" she said. Nat Carruthers, operations president for Atlas Sports Genetics, says the company has sold several hundred test kits since it began marketing them in 2008. ""Our goal is to help people become the athlete they were born to be,"" not to exclude kids from certain sports, Carruthers said. He said critics have misrepresented the test ""to sound like we're telling parents what their kid should do and how good their kid will be. That's not at all our claim or desire,"" he said. CyGene Laboratories, based in Coral Springs, Fla., sold a similar $100 swab test online for different sports-related genes until last fall, but it has suspended operations. CyGene also sold kits online advertised as testing for human diseases, but Mark Munzer, the company's former president, said that industry is reeling from a Food and Drug Administration crackdown last year on efforts to sell disease-related gene tests in retail pharmacies. The FDA scheduled a hearing on Tuesday to receive feedback from an expert panel on how the agency should be regulating direct-to-consumer genetic tests that make medical claims. Marketers of sports gene tests that don't make medical claims aren't FDA regulated. University of Maryland researcher Stephen Roth, a specialist in exercise physiology and genetics who has studied the ACTN3 gene, said the science of how genes influence athletic ability ""is in its infancy"" and that marketers' claims are based on ""gross assumptions."" Roth said roughly 80 percent of people worldwide have the ACTN3 gene that has been linked with explosive force. The fact that few of them become elite athletes underscores that it takes more than genes to make a sports star. Also, about 20 percent of people have a gene variation that inhibits production of the protein involved in explosive force. That doesn't mean they can't excel in sports, Roth said, citing a Spanish long jumper who made it to the Olympics despite lacking that protein. Dr. Lainie Friedman Ross, a medical ethicist and pediatrician at the University of Chicago, said the tests raise ethical questions when used in children because they're too young to understand the possible ramifications and to give adequate consent. ""This is recreational genetics with a real serious potential for harm,"" Ross said. ""People are going to think, `If my kid has this, I'm going to have to push real hard. If my kid doesn't have it, I'm going to give up before I start,"" she said. Instead, Ross said, parents should ""let kids follow their dreams."" ""While parents have the authority to make health care decisions about their children, this type of genetic testing is elective at best and should actively involve the children in the decision-making process,"" Ross said. ___ Online: JAMA: http://jama.ama-assn.org",0,story_reviews_01170
"En Español TUESDAY, March 8, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Acupuncture may help reduce the severity of hot flashes and other symptoms of menopause, according to a small study. The research included 53 postmenopausal women, with about half receiving traditional Chinese acupuncture twice a week and the others given sham acupuncture treatments. After 10 weeks, the women in the traditional acupuncture group had significantly less severe hot flashes and mood swings than those who'd gotten the fake treatment. There were no differences between the two groups in terms of vaginal dryness and urinary tract infection. The beneficial effects of traditional acupuncture, according to the researchers, did not appear to be associated with changes in levels of hormones that trigger menopause and its associated symptoms. The findings were published online March 7 in Acupuncture in Medicine. Though the researchers acknowledged that they did not monitor how long symptom relief lasted, they suggested that traditional acupuncture may offer an alternative for women who can't or don't want to use hormone replacement therapy to ease menopause symptoms.

"LONDON – Patrick Hetzner tried diets and exercise, just about everything short of stomach stapling to lose weight. Nothing worked. Five months ago he tried something new: a stomach pacemaker that curbed his appetite. Since having it implanted, Hetzner, a 20-year-old Munich mailman, has knocked off more than 10 kilos (22 pounds) from his earlier weight of 104 kilos (229 pounds). Hetzner got the device as part of a clinical trial. Since being approved by Britain last month, the device is available for sale across the European Union. It works a bit like a cardiac pacemaker, and consists of a stimulator and a sensor surgically implanted onto the stomach. The stimulator sends out electrical pulses meant to trick the stomach and brain into thinking the body is full. Hetzner said the pulses kick in a few minutes after he starts eating or drinking. He said they make him feel full after finishing about half the amount of food he would normally eat. ""It feels like a little pressure on my stomach or a tickle, but it's not a bad feeling,"" he said in a telephone interview. ""It's been like a little guide to help me change my life,"" he said. So far, about 65 patients in two studies have received the device from U.S. pacemaker manufacturer Intrapace. Only about half of those have had the pacemaker for at least a year, and most lost about 20 percent of their weight and kept it off. Other stomach pacemakers are on the market but most are used to relieve symptoms like nausea and vomiting, not to fight obesity. Appetite is partly controlled by signals sent from nerves around the stomach to the brain; the stomach pacemaker taps into that communication system, sending a message to the brain that the body is full after a relatively small amount of food is consumed. ""If you can stimulate the nerves going from the stomach to the brain, that should indeed have an effect in reducing food intake,"" said Stephen Bloom, an obesity expert at Imperial College in London, who is not connected to Intrapace or the clinical trials. Bloom, however, questioned whether the device would work long-term, as people might eventually get used to the electrical pulses and keep eating anyway. Doctors familiar with the pacemaker say there will always be ways for patients to eat and work around the system. ""We could make the (stomach pacemaker) work so people feel like they're going to throw up, but we don't want that,"" said Thomas Horbach, chief of surgery at Stadtkrankenhaus Schwabach, near Munich, who led one of the trials. ""If you take away all the responsibilities from the patient, they will not change on their own."" As an additional benefit, the sensor tracks when patients eat, drink or exercise, so patients can chart their progress. Intrapace has also created an online network for patients to trade weight loss advice and share experiences. Other surgical approaches to weight loss come with serious side effects. People who have their stomach stapled or have a gastric band must eat smaller amounts of mostly low-fat foods, because their stomachs can't accommodate or process large volumes. If they overeat, they will feel nauseous, vomit, or suffer from other problems. The most serious side effect seen in the pacemaker has been an infection linked to surgery. In Britain, the pacemaker costs about 15,000 pounds ($24,040), including the keyhole surgery used to implant it. Intrapace President Chuck Brynelsen said that's comparable to other weight loss surgeries. The device is authorized for sale across the EU, though the company is first targeting weight loss clinics in Britain, Germany and Spain. It also plans to submit the device for approval in the U.S. once it has more data, and hopes it will be available there in 2014. The pacemaker hasn't yet been implanted commercially in Europe, but Intrapace is in talks with clinics interested in offering it. Brynelsen said the battery in the device lasts about five years and it will be up to patients how long they want to keep the pacemaker. ""We don't know if patients will see (the stomach pacemaker) as a bridge to recovery or whether this is a crutch they will need for the longer term,"" he said. Some experts said the pacemaker did not address people's underlying reasons for overeating. ""The problem with these devices is they assume people are rational and that they eat because they're hungry,"" said Stephan Rossner, a professor in the obesity unit at Karolinska University Hospital. ""A lot of obese patients eat because they're depressed, they can't sleep at night, or they have nobody to have sex with,"" he said. ""So whatever you insert into their stomach, they can out-eat that device because it's other things that drive them to consume."" Hetzner said he intends to keep the stomach pacemaker for about four years. ""I don't want to backslide,"" he said, adding he would recommend the device to others. ""I want to be sure I can stick with it and that my body adapts to this new way of eating."" ___ Online: http://www.abiliti.com/en",0,story_reviews_01177
"En Español WEDNESDAY, March 2, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- The new chemotherapy drug eribulin extends the lives of metastatic breast cancer patients who have received extensive treatment, according to a new study. The researchers found that among patients whose cancer had spread, those who took the drug lived a median of 2.5 months longer than those who received a physician-chosen treatment -- 13.1 months versus 10.6 months. The study included 508 women who were given eribulin and 254 women who received treatment of the physician's choice, which was defined as: any single-agent chemotherapy, hormonal or biological treatment approved for cancer treatment; radiotherapy; or symptomatic treatment alone. The most common side effects in both groups were fatigue and depletion of white blood cells. Numbness and pain stemming from nerve damage were the most common adverse event connected to eribulin that led women to drop out of the study (24, or 5 percent). The study, known as the EMBRACE trial, was funded by Eisai Inc., which markets eribulin. Dr. Javier Cortes, of the Vall d'Hebron University Hospital and Vall d'Hebron Institute of Oncology in Barcelona, Spain, and colleagues published the findings in the March 3 online edition of The Lancet. ""This global phase 3 study establishes a potential new standard treatment for women with heavily pretreated metastatic breast cancer, for whom there was previously no chemotherapy treatment with proven survival benefit,"" the authors wrote. In a related editorial, Drs. Nancy U. Lin and Harold J. Burstein, of the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute and Harvard Medical School in Boston, said: ""EMBRACE provides much needed, high-level evidence for chemotherapy use in patients with heavily pretreated breast cancer. And that evidence suggests that the methods to treat advanced breast cancer are growing, the treatment challenge in refractory disease is a little bit less daunting, and the treatment results are a little bit better than they were before."" Commenting on the study, Dr. Stephanie Bernik, chief of surgical oncology at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City, said, ""The findings of this trial are exciting because they will propel eribulin into wider use. This drug shows much promise, and it should certainly be included in additional trials to fully establish its benefit."" ""It would be interesting to see if the drug offers the same benefit in women that have not been treated with multiple drugs before exposure to eribulin,"" she added.

"As a nicotine-gum addict, Mike Metzger used to worry about the warning on its label: ""Stop using the nicotine gum at the end of 12 weeks."" But that was before a prominent smoking-cessation scientist, K. Michael Cummings, told him to keep chewing the gum as long as it helped him stay off cigarettes. So 15 years after quitting smoking, Mr. Metzger, a 63-year old retired New York telephone worker, still chews 16 pieces of nicotine gum a day. Public health officials are backing away from recommending against the long-term use of nicotine gum, lozenges and patches. The Food and Drug Administration is considering whether to eliminate the 12-week warning and instead recommend nicotine-based quit-smoking aids for extended—perhaps even permanent—use. Anti-tobacco activists and GlaxoSmithKline PLC, the U.S.'s leading marketer of nicotine-replacement therapy, or NRT, are also backing the potential move. ""There really doesn't appear to be any great harm"" with long-term use of NRT, says Mr. Cummings, chair of the department of health behavior in the cancer-prevention division at the Roswell Park Cancer Institute in Buffalo, N.Y.. ""You're better off chewing gum or wearing a patch than smoking."" By giving former smokers the most addictive chemical in cigarettes—nicotine—NRT is designed to ease the difficulty of quitting. In more than a quarter century on the market, nicotine gum, lozenges and patches have amassed a strong safety record. Even among most long-term NRT users, the hazards of nicotine pale beside the dangers of smoking, which is the number one cause of lung cancer and the most preventable cause of cardiac death. Nicotine itself is not believed by scientists to raise the risk of developing cancer. It may raise the risk of cardiovascular disease, however. It can elevate heart rate, constrict blood vessels and raise blood pressure. Some people have adverse skin reactions to nicotine patches. Like other addictive substances, nicotine essentially hijacks the brain's reward system, conditioning users to associate intake with pleasure. But while other addictive drugs tend either to stimulate or relax users, nicotine can do both, depending on the user's mood, giving it a particularly tight grip. Sudden withdrawal from the drug can induce intense cravings, nervousness, irritability, confusion and insomnia, among other symptoms. Obtaining nicotine from gum, lozenge or patch doesn't replace entirely the pleasure of smoking any more than popping a tablet of caffeine—the addictive element in coffee—could equal the pleasure of a fresh-brewed cup of cappuccino. But jolts of nicotine can reduce the physical symptoms of withdrawal while quitters battle longings for the taste of tobacco, the sensation of smoke and various rituals that accompany the habit. (Going off NRT can also lead to withdrawal symptoms.) Studies, typically funded by NRT-manufacturers, have shown that those who use the products are about twice as likely to quit smoking after 12 weeks, compared to those who don't use NRT. But studies of those who successfully quit outside of NRT clinical trials often show no NRT advantage over the cold-turkey approach. About one in five American adults smokes—a rate that has remained virtually unchanged since 2004. NRT makers offer different dosages for heavy and light smokers, and recommend that the frequency of use decline over time, for instance, from a piece of gum every hour or two in the first six weeks of quitting to every four to eight hours in weeks 10 through 12. Glaxo products—which include Nicorette gum and lozenges and NicoDerm patches—account for more than half of the $835 million market in annual U.S. retail sales of over-the-counter smoking-cessation aids, according to market-research firm Euromonitor International. Pfizer Inc. and Novartis AG also market NRT. Those skeptical of any move to eliminate warnings on long-term NRT use note that many public-health officials and anti-tobacco agencies have received funding from NRT's makers. ""There's no money to be made in cold turkey quitting, even though cold turkey is how the vast majority of former smokers kicked the habit,"" says John Polito, editor of WhyQuit, a popular blog that endorses cold-turkey cessation from tobacco. The FDA has faced increasing pressure in recent years to loosen its rules on quit-smoking aids. Some public-health groups have filed petitions with the agency urging changes. Another impetus is the landmark 2009 law signed by President Barack Obama that, for the first time, empowered the FDA to regulate tobacco products. The law, which is partly aimed at reducing smoking's toll on the nation's health, instructs the agency to consider rewriting the warnings on nicotine-replacement products, which range from eight to 12 weeks, depending on the type. The warnings date back to when nicotine gum first received FDA approval back in 1984. They weren't based on hard science connecting health hazards to long-term nicotine addiction, but were set to mirror the length of use in clinical trials. Britain's Royal College of Physicians, which sets health standards in the U.K., concluded in a 2007 report on nicotine addiction that ""medicinal nicotine is a very safe drug"" and ""there are no grounds to suspect appreciable long-term adverse effects on health."" Many other countries have less-stringent policies on NRT. Canada, Germany, Japan and the U.K. have approved recommended-use periods of anywhere from six to 12 months. A few studies have examined the use of NRT beyond the current recommendations. Last year, researchers at the University of Pennsylvania published a study in Annals of Internal Medicine that found that smokers who use a nicotine patch for 24 weeks may be more likely to stay off cigarettes than those treated for eight weeks. However, the study reported no difference in the quit rates of the two groups when they were checked at the one-year mark, revealing the fact that many people began smoking again. The senior author of the study, funded by federal grants, has served as a consultant for GlaxoSmithKline. Barbara Gregg says that without nicotine gum she likely would have returned to smoking. Ms. Gregg, a 41-year-old executive assistant in the University of Minnesota's department of medicine, smoked for 22 years before she quit by going cold-turkey in 2007. She started chewing the gum about six months later, after experiencing nicotine cravings. In 2009, before the start of her mother's funeral, she kept her father company as he smoked a cigarette in the parking lot. ""I can guarantee you that if I didn't have nicotine gum with me, I absolutely would have bummed a cigarette off my dad and picked back up again,"" she says.

"En Español MONDAY, Feb. 28, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy may be able to avoid the accompanying muscle loss and malnutrition by taking fish oil supplements that contain omega-3 fatty acids, new research suggests. The finding is based on a small study involving just 40 lung cancer patients. Nevertheless, it raises hope that a simple, noninvasive intervention might go a long way towards countering the fatigue, poorer prognosis and impaired quality of life that can result from chemo-induced muscle mass loss. ""Fish oil may prevent loss of weight and muscle by interfering with some of the pathways that are altered in advanced cancer,"" study author Dr. Vera Mazurak, of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, said in a news release. ""This holds great promise, because currently there is no effective treatment for cancer-related malnutrition."" Mazurak and her colleagues report their observations in the Feb. 28 online edition of Cancer. To explore the therapeutic potential of fish oil supplements, the authors offered 16 cancer patients undergoing an initial 10-week chemotherapy regimen a daily dose of 2.2 grams of a particular omega-3 fatty acid called eicosapentaenoic (EPA). While these patients took fish oil supplements throughout their chemotherapy treatment, a second group of 24 patients underwent the same regimen minus the fish oil. The results: continual muscle and fat measurements revealed that the group that took no fish oil supplementation lost an average of just over 5 pounds; the supplement group lost no weight. What's more, blood analyses revealed that those in the fish oil group who had the biggest bump in bloodstream EPA concentrations also had the greatest muscle mass gains. Specifically, nearly 70 percent of those in the fish oil group either kept their pre-chemo muscle mass or gained muscle. By comparison, less than 30 percent in the non-supplement group kept their original muscle mass. Total fat tissue measurements were unaffected by fish oil supplementation, the team noted, and no side effects were observed. The authors concluded that fish oil supplementation appears to be a safe and effective way to prevent malnutrition among cancer patients, and may ultimately prove to be of benefit for other groups of people, such as elderly patients who also face a significant ongoing risk for muscle loss. Lona Sandon, a registered dietitian and assistant professor of clinical nutrition at the University of Texas Southwestern Dallas, reacted with cautious optimism to the findings. ""Malnutrition is a big concern with cancer patients undergoing chemotherapy and radiation,"" she noted. ""Because first of all they do have wasting from the cancer itself, which is very metabolically active and eats up your energy stores. And then with chemotherapy, there is some inflammation that's detrimental to the heart and muscle, as it can cause muscle breakdown. And preservation of lean muscle tissue, we know, leads to better outcomes."" ""So certainly this does seem to be promising,"" Sandon said. ""And other similar studies have looked at omega-3 and muscle preservation and have also suggested that fish oil can act to prevent inflammation caused by both disease and hardcore medications, like chemotherapy agents."" ""But I would caution that the amount of pure concentrated fish oil supplement the people in this study were given is a lot,"" she added. ""Much much more than any recommended dietary allowance, along the lines of two to three servings of fish per week."" But, she said, ""I would say this is certainly worthy of continuing research and exploration. But meanwhile, people should definitely not go out and start consuming huge amounts of fish oil.""

"En Español By Jenifer Goodwin HealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, Feb. 24, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Blood tests that indicate prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are rising rapidly over time are of little use in detecting aggressive prostate cancer and should not be done, a new study indicates. PSA is a protein produced by cells of the prostate gland. High levels of PSA can be a marker for prostate cancer, although it's far from a perfect screening tool, experts say. Men with both high and low levels of PSA can have cancer or not have cancer. The thought was that since high PSA levels are correlated with prostate cancer, rapidly rising levels of PSA, called ""PSA velocity,"" from one year to another would also be an indicator of prostate cancer. However, the new study found that PSA velocity doesn't add any useful information beyond what physicians can already tell from other methods of prostate cancer screening, including the one-time PSA level test and digital rectal exams. Current screening guidelines that recommend biopsies for men who have high PSA velocity but no other signs of prostate cancer -- such as a suspected abnormality during a digital rectal exam or high PSA level during a single test -- are leading to many unnecessary biopsies, the researchers said. ""We found there was no strong association between PSA velocity and prostate cancer, and virtually none with aggressive prostate cancer,"" said study author Andrew Vickers, of Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. ""The velocity didn't add anything more to detecting aggressive prostate cancers."" The study is published online Feb. 24 in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute. The whole issue of prostate cancer screening -- including the PSA test, the digital rectal exam and PSA velocity -- has been controversial, said Dr. Otis Brawley, chief medical officer of the American Cancer Society (ACS). Part of the difficulty is, while current screening methods are good at detecting cancer, they can't distinguish between aggressive, life-threatening prostate cancers and those that are slow-growing and relatively benign. And many prostate cancers are just that -- of little risk to men during their lifetimes, Brawley said. Current ACS prostate screening cancer guidelines recommend that men make an informed decision with their doctor about whether to be tested for prostate cancer. ""Research has not yet proven that the potential benefits of testing outweigh the harms of testing and treatment,"" according to the ACS. As for PSA velocity, the ACS doesn't have a position on what PSA velocity warrants a biopsy. But the National Comprehensive Cancer Network and American Urological Association guidelines do recommend biopsies based on high PSA velocities, even in the absence of an elevated PSA or a suspicious digital rectal exam, according to background information in the study. And many internal medicine and primary-care doctors, in part because of fears of litigation, do order biopsies based on fast-rising PSA levels, Brawley said. ""It's something that has become almost a community standard. If a guy has a PSA of .8 last year, and a year or so later you've repeated it and it's 1.9, because it has increased by a factor of 1 he gets sent to biopsy,"" Brawley said. In the study, researchers used data on more than 5,500 men in their 60s and 70s who took part in a drug trial for a prostate cancer prevention drug. The men in the study were all from the placebo arm, meaning they had not received the drug. As part of the trial, all of the men agreed to have a biopsy at the end of the trial, needed or not. Researchers did find a statistical association between PSA velocity and the chances of a biopsy coming back cancerous. But when they factored in other things that can influence risk, including a family history of the disease, being older, being black, PSA level and results of a digital rectal exam, there was virtually no association between PSA velocity and biopsy outcome. ""PSA velocity measurement is not useful,"" Brawley said. Grace Lu-Yao, a cancer epidemiologist at the Cancer Institute of New Jersey who wrote an accompanying editorial, said she agreed with the authors' conclusions that PSA velocity does not seem to be a good predictor of prostate cancer. In addition, tracking PSA levels overtime can also cause anxiety to men, who often worry if their PSA level has suddenly shot up.

"Less than a week after the Food and Drug Administration approved the marketing of Lap-Band weight-loss surgery to 11 million new patients, a pair of studies has found that a different, older procedure is more effective and no riskier than either the Lap-Band or another less-drastic surgery, sleeve gastrectomy. In the first head-to-head comparison of weight-loss surgeries widely used in the United States, UC San Francisco researchers found that those who had their stomach capacity reduced by a Roux-en-Y bypass, which reduces the stomach's capacity and bypasses a part of the intestine, lost more weight, required less diabetes medication and were less likely to need further surgery than those who received the Lap-Band. A second study found that diabetic patients who underwent sleeve gastrectomy, which surgically narrows the stomach to reduce food capacity, were more likely to continue needing diabetes medications than those who got the gastric bypass. Both studies were published Monday in the Archives of Surgery, Last week, the FDA broadened approval for the Lap-Band to people with a Body Mass Index as low as 30 if they also have a weight-related medical condition, a move that is expected to propel millions more obese patients into the offices of bariatric surgeons. The Lap-Band is an inflatable ring that is surgically implanted around the upper stomach. After surgical wounds have healed, saline solution is injected to expand the ring, limiting how much food can be consumed. Advertisement Yet both of the new studies suggest that the Roux-en-Y gastric bypass procedure, which is named for the surgeon who invented it and the shape of the altered small intestine, remains the standard for patients with severe obesity and serious weight-related illnesses such as diabetes. The procedure was first performed in 1993. The UC San Francisco study, led by surgeon Guilherme M. Campos, measured weight loss, improvement in metabolic function and quality of life in 185 patients one year after their surgeries. On all those measures, gastric bypass produced far better results than Lap-Band surgery. For instance, those who had had gastric bypass lost 64% of their excess weight on average in the year following surgery. Those who got the Lap-Band lost an average of 36% in the same period. The study also found that although gastric bypass patients had more complications in the first month after surgery, those who underwent Lap-Band surgery had a higher rate of complications later, and/or more need for surgical adjustments, making the overall complication rate similar for both procedures. Advertisement The authors concluded that gastric bypass ""has a better risk-benefit profile"" than Lap-Band surgery. The second study, conducted by researchers in Taiwan, compared 30 obese patients who were treated with gastric bypass for their poorly controlled diabetes with 30 similar patients who were treated with a procedure called ""gastric sleeving,"" which surgically reshapes the stomach to a smaller size but does not close down a portion of the intestine to food. The finding — that diabetes improved with gastric bypass but not with gastric sleeving — offered an important clue to why gastric bypasses seem to improve the metabolic function of diabetics virtually overnight. Neither sleeve gastrectomy nor the Lap-Band causes food to bypass any part of the intestine, suggesting that hormones in that part of the gut may play a key role in the changes that lead to diabetes. ""We need to just register that gastric bypass is the gold standard for diabetic control in overweight patients,"" said Beverly Hills-based weight-loss surgeon Ted Khalili, director of the Khalili Center for Bariatric Care, who was not involved in the study. But Khalili, whose practice is roughly split between Lap-Band and gastric-bypass surgery, added that the UC San Francisco findings are far less clear for patients whose primary objective is to lose weight. Although more weight loss was seen for the gastric bypass group in the one-year study, patients getting the Lap-Band continue to lose weight for two to three years after the procedure, Khalili said. Comparing the two patient populations three years after surgery would probably have narrowed the weight-loss gap considerably, Khalili said. melissa.healy@latimes.com",0,story_reviews_01188
"By Jenifer Goodwin HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Feb. 22, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- By analyzing patterns in the brain's electrical activity, researchers say they've been able to assess autism risk in children as young as 6 months of age. Researchers hooked up 79 babies aged 6 to 24 months to an EEG, or electroencephalogram, which records electrical activity in the brain. Forty-six of the infants had an older sibling with an autism spectrum disorder, while the other 33 had no family history of autism. Children who have a sibling with autism are much more likely to develop autism themselves, explained lead study author William Bosl, a neuroinformatics researcher at Children's Hospital Boston. Prior research has shown that about 20 percent of siblings of children with autism will also develop autism and another 40 to 50 percent will have some characteristics of the disorder, such as repetitive behaviors or problems with social interaction, language or communication, but not the full-blown disorder. While the children watched people blowing bubbles, researchers measured the babies' brain waves and analyzed the results using computer algorithms. The algorithms can detect subtle patterns in the lines created by EEGs that the human eye might miss, Bosl explained. When the babies were nine months old, researchers could predict who was in the high-risk autism group -- that is, they had a sibling with autism -- with nearly 80 percent accuracy. ""In this study, we have taken the first step in showing that there is definitive information in the electrical signals measured by EEG to distinguish normal controls from infants at high risk for developing autism,"" Bosl said. When broken out by gender, researchers found other differences. For example, at nine months they were able to predict which boys were in the high-risk group with near 100 percent accuracy. But accuracy for girls at that age was only 60 percent, not statistically significant. At six months of age, however, they could predict the high risk girls with about 80 percent accuracy, though they couldn't do the same for boys that young. ""It seems perhaps they are on a slightly different developmental trajectory,"" Bosl said. The study is published online Feb. 22 in BMC Medicine. EEGs measure brain electrical activity through electrodes attached to the scalp. The technology has been around for awhile -- developed in the late 1920s, it has been used for more than 60 years to detect seizures in epileptics. But it's the newer, artificial intelligence technology and sophisticated computer algorithms that enabled the researchers to look more deeply into what the EEGs show, Bosl said. ""Artificial intelligence gives us the ability to find patterns we might not find with our own eyes,"" Bosl said. ""One of the difficulties with a disorder like autism is that it's very heterogenous. A very high-functioning person with autism might not be so different from a so-called 'normal' person who is quirky. Defining the differences may be somewhat subtle."" EEGs are also relatively inexpensive, painless and safe, Bosl said. And unlike MRIs, they require no sedation, so testing could be put to widespread use, he said. ""My hope is we would have a simple way of measuring brain activity in every child and see the patterns emerging that might track autism characteristics,"" Bosl said. ""That would be tremendously useful. We know early intervention is extremely important. Right now, for a lot of children, that means 3 years old. What we don't know yet is if you can intervene at 9 or 12 months and how effective that could be."" Dr. Joshua Ewen, a neurologist and director of the clinical neurophysiology laboratory at the Kennedy Krieger Institute in Baltimore, said the study is well done and looks promising, but needs to be replicated. Also, the study predicted who was at high risk of autism, but it's unknown if those babies actually went on to develop autism, he noted. ""If it can eventually be shown that this technique can reliably identify which children will indeed develop autism, then we will have a valuable tool for early detection,"" Ewen said. ""Early detection continues to be of critical importance, as it opens the door to early intervention, which has been shown to improve outcomes for children with autism.""

"A growing number of doctors are offering an expensive laser procedure they say zaps away a common fungus that causes ugly, discolored nails. Published data on laser treatment for nail fungus is scant, but early results suggest it is a reasonable option for people who don't want the side effects of oral medications. Onychomycosis, or fungal infection of nails—most often on the toes—affects about 12% of Americans, according to the American Academy of Dermatology. Some people are genetically prone to it. Others, including swimmers and other athletes, may be more likely to get it because they go barefoot in public areas or because their feet are often damp, scientists say. In its mild forms, nail fungus is merely a cosmetic problem, but over time it can cause toenails to grow abnormally and become painful when walking. Toenail laser treatment offers a new alternative to oral medication, which carries a risk of liver damage, and a nail lacquer, which has poor efficacy. The cost of zapping nail fungus with a laser can range $750 to $1,500 for a treatment course. It isn't generally covered by insurance. Whether you choose oral medications or lasers, it can easily take a year for nails to clear entirely. So far only one company's laser has received Food and Drug Administration clearance, which is a streamlined review process for medical devices, for toenail fungus: PinPointe USA Inc., of Chico, Calif., received clearance in October to market its laser for ""the temporary increase of clear nail"" in patients, according to the FDA clearance letter. Two companies, Nomir Medical Technologies Inc. of Brooklyn, N.Y., which first applied in 2009, and CoolTouch Inc., of Roseville, Calif., have applied for FDA clearance for the nail-fungus purpose and are waiting for an FDA decision. Several other lasers, cleared by the FDA for other purposes, are being used ""off label"" by doctors to treat toenail fungus. Solid evidence of the lasers' effectiveness, is scant. In clinical practice, results have varied, according to doctors who have used the laser. New Jersey podiatrist Anas Khoury, who has no affiliation with any laser company, says he has been using Nomir's Noveon laser for toenails for about four months and says it works in about 80% of his patients. ""My patients and I are very happy with it,"" he adds. Philadelphia podiatrist Warren Joseph, who is a consultant for Nomir and a former consultant for PinPointe, says: ""I think it is a really interesting, viable alternative but I want to see published data."" His advice to patients: ""Ask for the evidence—and not just before-and-after pictures."" Treatments typically take 30 to 45 minutes for up to 10 toes. Depending on the severity of the problem and the laser used, patients may need one to four treatments. How the lasers work varies and how they affect toenail fungus isn't fully understood in all cases. Nomir says its lab research shows its laser kills fungus. CoolTouch says it believes its laser inhibits fungal growth, paving the way for the body's own defenses to clear the nail. So far only Nomir has published evidence of efficacy, but its study is small and short term. A company-funded study of 34 patients and 26 treated toes published last year in the Journal of the American Podiatric Medical Association found that after four laser treatments, 85% of the nails showed new growth without fungus. Of the total, 65% showed at least three millimeters of clear new nail and 26% had at least four millimeters. The study took its final measures six months after treatment, but hasn't yet published the data. PinPointe supplied The Wall Street Journal a summary of unpublished data from a study looking at 265 patients over two years. In the summary, 71.4% of the patients experienced continuous improvement over a year after a single session with its laser. If you are willing to risk side effects, the best tested—and likely most effective—treatment for toenail fungus remains oral medications such as Novartis AG's Lamisil, says Bryan C. Markinson, chief of podiatric medicine at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York. Dr. Markinson has been a paid adviser to Novartis and owns stock in Nomir and serves on its medical-advisory board. According to Lamisil's FDA-approved prescribing information, 3.3% of patients in clinical trials had abnormal levels of liver enzymes, a possible warning sign of liver damage, compared with 1.4% of people taking a placebo. In rare cases, people have needed liver transplants or died from liver failure after taking Lamisil. To prevent fungus recurrence, you must follow a scrupulous hygiene program, including anti-fungal spray for feet and shoes, not going barefoot, keeping feet clean and dry and changing socks daily, doctors say. ""Patients and some doctors have this expectation that because it's a laser treatment, once you zap it and its gone forever,"" says Dr. Markinson. ""That totally ignores the fact that this is an infectious disease and that recurrence is a certainty"" unless good prevention measures are taken. —Email aches@wsj.com Write to Laura Johannes at laura.johannes@wsj.com",0,story_reviews_01191
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A new look at the medical evidence shows zinc supplements may take the edge off the common cold. People practice coughing during a meeting for workers at the Maryland Department of Health and Mental Hygiene in Baltimore, September 3, 2009. REUTERS/Jonathan Ernst But not a whole lot. Although the precise estimate is still uncertain, researchers found that people who started taking zinc-loaded lozenges or syrups within 24 hours of showing symptoms — a sore throat, say, or runny nose — shortened their cold by one day. By comparison, a normal cold lasts about a week. Still, with an infection that currently has no good treatment and leads to an estimated 275 million lost work days a year in the U.S., well, what a difference a day makes. The review, published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international organization that evaluates medical research, also shows that people taking the supplements tended to have milder symptoms. ""I think one can give it a try,"" said Dr. Meenu Singh, a pediatrician at the Post Graduate Institute of Medical Education and Research in Chandigarh, India, who led the new work. ""But giving zinc over a long period of time for prevention should be done very carefully,"" she told Reuters Health. Zinc may interfere with other metals in the body, and that may have unpredictable consequences over the long haul, Singh said. An earlier Cochrane review from 1999 didn't find any signs that zinc supplements would work. But since then several new studies - known as randomized controlled trials - have been completed. The new review is based on 13 trials with 966 participants who either took zinc or a dummy treatment at the beginning of their symptoms. Another two trials found that zinc helped stave off colds, but the quality of that research was low. The bottom line: After seven days of treatment, those taking the supplements had less than half the chance of still being sick. A typical adult has a few colds every year. While the episodes usually aren't serious, the resulting visits to the doctor alone cost the U.S. an annual $7.7 billion, according to the new report. Singh said the side effects of zinc lozenges, which can be bought for a few dollars in any drug store in the U.S., come down to bad taste and some cases of nausea. The researchers did not study nasal zinc remedies, however. In 2009, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration warned Matrixx Initiatives to stop selling its widely used supplement Zicam after more than 130 users reportedly lost their sense of smell. Singh said there was no evidence of a similar danger from the lozenges or syrups. Exactly how well zinc works is a matter of future research, and the one day estimate may well change, the researchers note. They add it is currently unclear what dose and particular formulation of the supplement will be most helpful.

"Feb. 10, 2011 (Los Angeles) -- Giving clot-busting drugs to people with mild strokes could prevent more than 2,000 of them from becoming disabled each year, researchers say. A stroke occurs when a clot cuts off blood flow to parts of the brain. Those parts of the brain soon start to die. A drug called tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) dissolves clots and restores blood flow. Mild strokes -- characterized by such symptoms as clumsiness in the hand, weakness of an extremity, some slurred speech, temporary loss of vision, and/or dizziness -- account for more than half of strokes in the U.S. But people with mild strokes are typically denied tPA because the studies that established its effectiveness excluded mild cases, says Pooja Khatri, MD, of the University of Cincinnati. It's been assumed that people with mild strokes ""generally [do] well and the risk of tPA treatment, which includes a slight but significant risk of life-threatening bleeding in the brain, would not be worth the benefit,"" she says. In fact, one in three people who suffer a mild stroke are disabled three months later, Khatri says.",0,story_reviews_01208
"""This is such a radical change in thought that it's been hard for many people to get their heads around it,"" said Dr. Monica Morrow, chief of the breast service at Sloan-Kettering and an author of the study, which is being published Wednesday in The Journal of the American Medical Association. The National Cancer Institute paid for the study. Doctors and patients alike find it easy to accept more cancer treatment on the basis of a study, Dr. Morrow said, but get scared when the data favor less treatment. The new findings are part of a trend to move away from radical surgery for breast cancer. Rates of mastectomy , removal of the whole breast, began declining in the 1980s after studies found that for many patients, survival rates after lumpectomy and radiation were just as good as those after mastectomy. The trend reflects an evolving understanding of breast cancer. In decades past, there was a belief that surgery could ""get it all"" — eradicate the cancer before it could spread to organs and bones. But research has found that breast cancer can begin to spread early, even when tumors are small, leaving microscopic traces of the disease after surgery. The modern approach is to cut out obvious tumors — because lumps big enough to detect may be too dense for drugs and radiation to destroy — and to use radiation and chemotherapy to wipe out microscopic disease in other places. But doctors have continued to think that even microscopic disease in the lymph nodes should be cut out to improve the odds of survival. And until recently, they counted cancerous lymph nodes to gauge the severity of the disease and choose chemotherapy. But now the number is not so often used to determine drug treatment, doctors say. What matters more is whether the disease has reached any nodes at all. If any are positive, the disease could become deadly. Chemotherapy is recommended, and the drugs are the same, no matter how many nodes are involved. The new results do not apply to all patients, only to women whose disease and treatment meet the criteria in the study. Advertisement Continue reading the main story The tumors were early, at clinical stage T1 or T2, meaning less than two inches across. Biopsies of one or two armpit nodes had found cancer, but the nodes were not enlarged enough to be felt during an exam, and the cancer had not spread anywhere else. The women had lumpectomies, and most also had radiation to the entire breast, and chemotherapy or hormone-blocking drugs, or both. The study, at 115 medical centers, included 891 patients. Their median age was in the mid-50s, and they were followed for a median of 6.3 years. After the initial node biopsy , the women were assigned at random to have 10 or more additional nodes removed, or to leave the nodes alone. In 27 percent of the women who had additional nodes removed, those nodes were cancerous. But over time, the two groups had no difference in survival: more than 90 percent survived at least five years. Recurrence rates in the armpit were also similar, less than 1 percent. If breast cancer is going to recur under the arm, it tends to do so early, so the follow-up period was long enough, the researchers said. One potential weakness in the study is that there was not complete follow-up information on 166 women, about equal numbers from each group. The researchers said that did not affect the results. A statistician who was not part of the study said the missing information should have been discussed further, but probably did not have an important impact. It is not known whether the findings also apply to women who do not have radiation and chemotherapy, or to those who have only part of the breast irradiated. Nor is it known whether the findings could be applied to other types of cancer. Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

The results mean that women like those in the study will still have to have at least one lymph node removed, to look for cancer and decide whether they will need more treatment. But taking out just one or a few nodes should be enough. Dr. Armando E. Giuliano, the lead author of the study and the chief of surgical oncology at the John Wayne Cancer Institute at St. John's Health Center in Santa Monica , Calif., said: ""It shouldn't come as a big surprise, but it will. It's hard for us as surgeons and medical oncologists and radiation oncologists to accept that you don't have to remove the nodes in the armpit."" Dr. Grant W. Carlson, a professor of surgery at the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University , and the author of an editorial accompanying the study, said that by routinely taking out many nodes, ""I have a feeling we've been doing a lot of harm."" Indeed, women in the study who had the nodes taken out were far more likely (70 percent versus 25 percent) to have complications like infections, abnormal sensations and fluid collecting in the armpit. They were also more likely to have lymphedema. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Dr. Carlson said that some of his colleagues, even after hearing the new study results, still thought the nodes should be removed. ""The dogma is strong,"" he said. ""It's a little frustrating."" Eventually, he said, genetic testing of breast tumors might be enough to determine the need for treatment, and eliminate the need for many node biopsies. Two other breast surgeons not involved with the study said they would take it seriously. Dr. Elisa R. Port, the chief of breast surgery at Mount Sinai Medical Center in Manhattan, said: ""It's a big deal in the world of breast cancer. It's definitely practice-changing."" Dr. Alison Estabrook, the chief of the comprehensive breast center at St. Luke's-Roosevelt hospital in New York said surgeons had long been awaiting the results. ""In the past, surgeons thought our role was to get out all the cancer,"" Dr. Estabrook said. ""Now he's saying we don't really have to do that."" But both Dr. Estabrook and Dr. Port said they would still have to make judgment calls during surgery and remove lymph nodes that looked or felt suspicious. The new research grew out of efforts in the 1990s to minimize lymph node surgery in the armpit, called axillary dissection. Surgeons developed a technique called sentinel node biopsy, in which they injected a dye into the breast and then removed just one or a few nodes that the dye reached first, on the theory that if the tumor was spreading, cancer cells would show up in those nodes. If there was no cancer, no more nodes were taken. But if there were cancer cells, the surgeon would cut out more nodes. Although the technique spared many women, many others with positive nodes still had extensive cutting in the armpit, and suffered from side effects. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""Women really dread the axillary dissection,"" Dr. Giuliano said. ""They fear lymphedema. There's numbness, shoulder pain , and some have limitation of motion. There are a fair number of serious complications. Women know it."" After armpit surgery, 20 percent to 30 percent of women develop lymphedema, Dr. Port said, and radiation may increase the rate to 40 percent to 50 percent. Physical therapy can help, but there is no cure. The complications — and the fact that there was no proof that removing the nodes prolonged survival — inspired Dr. Giuliano to compare women with and without axillary dissection. Some doctors objected. They were so sure cancerous nodes had to come out that they said the study was unethical and would endanger women. ""Some prominent institutions wouldn't even take part in it,"" Dr. Giuliano said, though he declined to name them. ""They're very supportive now. We don't want to hurt their feelings. They've seen the light.""",0,story_reviews_01209
"FDA Approves First Drug To Prevent Preterm Births Enlarge this image toggle caption Mario Tama/Getty Images Mario Tama/Getty Images The biggest reason why the United States has higher infant mortality than other developed countries is that American women are more likely to deliver prematurely – before 37 weeks. And, for unknown reasons, the U.S. rate of preterm delivery has been going up in recent years. That's why it's a pretty big deal that the Food and Drug Administration has OK'd a drug, called 17-HP, that experts say could make a dent in the preemie problem. Not a huge dent, but a significant one. The March of Dimes calculates that if all the women eligible to get the newly approved drug actually did, there would be 10,000 fewer preemies a year – out of more than half-a-million born that way. ""Although that may seem like a small percent, it's really a very extraordinary ability to impact on what is really a major public health problem,"" Dr. Alan Fleischman, the March of Dimes medical director, told Shots. According to the best research, the drug reduces the risk of premature birth by one-third among women who are at high risk because they had a previous preterm birth. The drug is not for women whose prior premature births were of twins or other multiple births, or who are carrying more than one fetus in their current pregnancy. Nor is it for women who have other conditions that raise their risk of preterm birth, such as high blood pressure or infection. And even for the 30,000 or so women who are eligible, 17-HP, which will be marketed as Makena, isn't a magic bullet. The study showed that 37 percent of women who got weekly injections of it delivered prematurely, compared to 55 percent of women who got injections of a placebo. Interestingly, the drug is not new — it's just taken a long and circuitous route to approval. In 1956, the FDA approved 17-HP for the treatment of certain cancers and other hormonal disorders, under the brand name Delalutin. But its manufacturer withdrew it from the market in 2000 ""for reasons unrelated to safety,"" as the FDA puts it. In fact, as a Federal Register posting last year chronicled, there have been questions raised about whether 17-HP caused birth defects of various kinds. In the 1970s, the FDA required warnings on drugs containing progesterone, as 17-HP does, because of an increased risk of birth defects. They later revoked them. The FDA is apparently satisfied that 17-HP is safe, but it's requiring its sponsors KV Pharmaceuticals and TherRx to conduct further studies of women who have taken it and children exposed during pregnancy. Everyone in this field is mindful of the long-running tragedy of vaginal and other cancers and male urinary disorders that resulted from the last drug thought to prevent premature birth – a synthetic estrogen called diethylstilbesterol, or DES. In 1971 researchers realized children exposed to DES in utero had a higher incidence of vaginal and breast cancers, and males were subsequently found to have urinary-tract problems. Fleischman, the March of Dimes official, says there's no such risk from 17-HP, partly because it's not used before the 16th week of pregnancy, when fetal organs have already formed. ""We have been very aggressively tracking all the data,"" Fleischman says, ""and we have no reason to believe that this drug will increase birth defects.""",0,story_reviews_01216
"Feb. 2, 2011 -- The human papillomavirus (HPV) vaccine can help stave off genital warts in boys and men, according to a new study in the Feb. 3 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. Of 4,065 boys and men aged 16 to 26 from 18 countries, vaccination with an HPV vaccine that targets four types of HPV infection -- HPV-6, HPV-11, HPV-16, and HPV-18 -- protects against infection with these types of HPV and potentially the development of related external genital warts or lesions. HPV, a sexually transmitted disease, can be transmitted through vaginal, anal, and oral sex and has been linked to genital warts as well as cervical, vaginal, vulvar, oral, penile, and anal cancers. Two HPV vaccines are now approved by the FDA: Cervarix and Gardasil. Both of these vaccines are recommended to prevent cervical cancers. These vaccines are now on the CDC's routine childhood vaccine schedule for girls starting at age 9. The Gardasil vaccine has also received FDA approval for prevention of genital warts. The vaccine is recommended for optional use in boys and men. The vaccine is used in girls and boys and young adults ages 9 to 26 for prevention of genital warts caused by HPV types 6 and 11. ""The most salient message is that the [Gardasil] vaccine can prevent HPV infection on the external genital region, which means that we can now prevent most cases of genital warts if the boy is vaccinated at a sufficiently early age,"" says study researcher Joel Palefsky, MD, a professor of medicine at the University of California, San Francisco.",0,story_reviews_01220
"En Español By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Feb. 2, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- A large international trial finds that the Gardasil vaccine shields young men from human papillomavirus (HPV) as well as it protects young women. HPV is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women, but also has been linked to penile cancer and other malignancies in men. According to a study in the Feb. 3 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, which was funded by the vaccine's maker, Merck & Co., Gardasil was 90 percent effective in older teenaged boys and young men. ""Studies like this underscore the 'human' in human papillomavirus,"" said Fred Wyand, director of the HPV Resource Center at the American Social Health Association. ""This well-designed study reinforces the idea that there is value in vaccinating young men against a virus that is nearly ubiquitous among sexually active individuals."" Gardasil protects against several strains of HPV, which is the leading cause of cervical cancer in women. It has also been linked to vulvar, anal and throat cancers. Studies have shown it to be about 100 percent effective in preventing precancerous cervical lesions in females. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the vaccine for girls in 2008 and for boys aged 9 through 26 in 2009. Although the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that 11- and 12-year-old girls begin receiving the vaccine as part of school vaccination efforts, an advisory panel voted against routine use of the vaccine in boys and men. Uptake of the vaccine, which costs about $390 for the 3-shot regimen, has been far from universal among girls. According to a study presented last year by researchers at the University of Maryland, just one-third of teen girls and young women who start the three-dose series actually finish, and almost three-quarters don't start it at all. But study author Anna Giuliano believes that, ""vaccinating males would have a direct benefit that men would receive, as well as a community benefit. If you reduce infections in men, you're going to reduce transmission to their partners so you have the herd immunity effect."" HPV is almost ubiquitous in males and females, but experts note that most people will clear the virus naturally so that it does not result in any harm. This study involved more than 4,000 boys and men aged 16-to-26 from 18 different countries who were randomly assigned to get the vaccine or not. All were HPV-free at the beginning of the trial, and were followed for about three years. Among participants who completed the three-vaccine series, Gardasil afforded 90 percent protection against HPV. ""It's a similar efficacy to what we've seen in females,"" said Giuliano, who is chair of cancer epidemiology and genetics at the H. Lee Moffitt Cancer Center in Tampa. The researchers also saw some reduction in the number of precancerous penile lesions, although at this point they said it's impossible to know whether this will result in a lower rate of penile cancers. ""We're going to finally be able to see men benefit from vaccine, as women have, in coming years,"" said Giuliano.

"En Español By Maureen Salamon HealthDay Reporter MONDAY, Jan. 24, 2011 (HealthDay News) -- Doctors administering deep brain stimulation to control a patient's severe pain report that they discovered the treatment consistently lowered the man's hard-to-control high blood pressure. The finding introduces the possibility that deep brain stimulation -- a surgical implant that delivers electrical pulses to the brain -- might one day become a treatment for drug-resistant hypertension or lead to clues about the brain's role in regulating blood pressure. The study is reported in the Jan. 25 print issue of the journal Neurology. About 10 percent of high blood pressure cases either can't be controlled with medication or patients cannot tolerate them, study author Dr. Nikunj K. Patel, a neurosurgeon at Frenchay Hospital in Bristol, England, said in a journal news release. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, high blood pressure affects 30 percent of American adults. The condition raises the risk of heart attack and stroke. ""It's a really interesting paper,"" said Dr. Nicholas D. Schiff, director of the Laboratory of Cognitive Neuromodulation at New York-Presbyterian Hospital/Weill Cornell Medical Center. ""I thought it was compelling, though single cases are always questionable"" to generalize. In the case study, a 55-year-old man was implanted with a deep brain stimulator to treat severe pain stemming from a stroke. Although the patient was taking four drugs to control his high blood pressure, which was diagnosed at the time of his stroke, his blood pressure had remained high. The man's blood pressure gradually decreased enough for him to stop taking all blood pressure medications, though the deep brain stimulation failed to control his pain long-term. When researchers tested turning off the stimulator after two years, the patient's blood pressure rose significantly. The study adds to other recent research focused on neuromodulation, which harnesses the power of electrical impulses in the body for therapeutic benefit. Tactics being tested include renal nerve ablation, a procedure that emits low-power radiofrequency along the nerves next to the kidneys, interrupting signals that trigger high blood pressure. ""In the general sense, neuromodulation for blood pressure is really going to be a revolutionary treatment for chronic [high] blood pressure,"" said cardiologist Dr. Marc Penn, director of the Cleveland Clinic's Bakken Heart-Brain Center. ""I think it's really interesting physiology,"" added Penn, noting that the results would need to be repeated multiple times before a therapy based on it could be developed. Schiff, however, was hesitant to predict that deep brain stimulation might become a common treatment for hard-to-control high blood pressure. ""This is a case report, and not a treatment for anything,"" he said, adding, ""There are risks to this procedure and one has to really look at the tradeoffs.""

"Antidepressants relieve hot flashes By Rob Stein An antidepressant can help alleviate hot flashes that plague many menopausal women, according to new federally funded research. A study involving 205 women found those taking the antidepressant Lexapro experienced a 47 percent reduction in number of hot flashes they were experiencing and the hot flashes they did have tended to be less severe, researchers reported in the Journal of the American Medical Association. For years, many women took hormones to alleviate hots flashes. But hormone use plummeted after the federal government's massive Women's Health Initiative shocked women and doctors by concluding the risks of the medication outweighed its benefits. Since then, many women have been suffering through hot flashes and searching for effective alternatives. Some small pilot studies have indicated that the newer class of antidepressants known as selective serotonin and serotonin norepinephrine reupdate inhibitors (SSRIs and SNRIs) might be effective. In the new study, Ellen Freeman of the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine in Philadelphia and colleagues gave 205 women who were either starting to go through menopause who had already gone through menopause either Lexapro or a placebo for eight weeks. When the study started, the women were having an average of nearly 10 hot flashes each day. The number of hot flashes among the women taking Lexapro, which is also known as escitalopram, dropped to about five on average after eight weeks--a 47 percent decrease or about 4.6 fewer hot flashes per day, the researchers reported. The severity of the hot flashes also decreased. Among those taking a placebo, the number of hot flashes dropped to 6.43 per day, a 33 percent decrease of 3.2 fewer hot flashes per day. Lexapro seemed to work even among women who were not anxious or depressed. The hot flashes increased after the women stopped taking the drug but not among those taking a placebo. Although the benefit was modest, it appeared to be significant enough that women might consider trying it, the researchers said. The study is the first to examine whether there are any racial differences in how well an antidepressant works in alleviating hot flashes. African-American women are more likely than white women to report hot flashes. The study found none.",0,story_reviews_01239
"Studies show that for kids' ear infections, antibiotics work better than waiting By Jennifer LaRue Huget Being a parent these days sometimes entails this hypocrisy: Yes, I know overuse of antibiotics is creating superbugs that may soon conquer the universe. But please give some to my kid anyway. Now two new studies (bolstered by an accompanying editorial) in the New England Journal of Medicine demonstrate what we parents have suspected for years: When it comes to ear infections, antibiotics are in order. Current practice guidelines for treating kids' mild middle-ear infections -- or acute otitis media -- call for watchful waiting, to be followed by antibiotics only if symptoms worsen or don't cease. That sounds fine in theory, but it's a tough pill to swallow when it's your own wee one who's wailing and writhing in pain. Ear infections hurt, and waiting for them to run their course can be excruciating. Both of the studies, in contrast to earlier research on which the ""watchful waiting"" approach has been based, are considered well-designed, even if they are on the small side. Both show that antibiotics are more effective than placebos in relieving ear-infection symptoms such as fever, poor appetite, decreased activity and irritability and suggested that their benefits warrant their being administered early on, regardless of the seeming severity of a child's symptoms. Interestingly, antibiotics were no more effective at reducing pain, as reported by parents or children, than placebos. One of the studies noted that while antibiotics -- specifically, amoxicillin paired with clavulanate -- shortened the duration of symptoms, half the children on placebo eventually got better without the aid of those drugs. Still, some of the placebo-group kids required ""rescue treatment"" when their symptoms grew markedly worse. The studies also noted that the use of antibiotics must be weighed against the risk of antimicrobial resistance, to which prescriptions for childhood maladies such as ear infections are thought to contribute mightily, and against antibiotics' side effects, which can include diarrhea and eczema. As it happens, on Christmas Eve, my daughter (who, at 17, is wee no more) woke up with a wicked pain in her ear. Her doctor took one quick look inside and wrote a prescription for Augmentin, a popular drug that combines amoxicillin with clavulanate potassium. By Christmas morning, the pain had subsided. Did I feel guilty for potentially contributing to the development of a superbug? The thought never crossed my mind. It doesn't tend to, when you're worried about your kid -- and grateful when her pain goes away.",1,story_reviews_01245
"Still, he adds, ""it's an important step forward."" The technology is likely prohibitively expensive and time-consuming at this point, he says. ""It's not ready for prime time, but researchers are actively working on methods to increase its efficiency,"" he says. ""Patients are very concerned about loss rates with aminocentesis and CVS and want reassurance about their pregnancies, so we are always looking for a better test,"" says Jennifer Wu, an obstetrician/gynecologist Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""This test looks very promising, but it is also very expensive,"" While there are risks attached to amniocentesis and CVS screens, these are minimized when the test is performed by a skilled obstetrician, she says. The new test looks ""very promising,"" says Cathy Sullivan, a genetic counselor at the University of Texas Health Sciences Center in Houston. ""We are not quite there yet, but it may become a real possibility for finding out real information without having to risk a pregnancy."" For example, ""If this comes back negative, you don't need an amniocentesis, but if it comes back positive, we would probably still do an amniocentesis to confirm the results,"" she says. While the new screen only looks for Down syndrome, Sullivan says that some of the other trisomy birth defects can be more easily identified on an ultrasound exam. ""Many babies with Down syndrome appear normal on an ultrasound,"" she says. Joyce Fox, MD, the chief of medical genetics at Cohen Children's Medical Center in New Hyde Park, N.Y., definitely sees a role for a test such as the one described in the new study. For now the test just looks for Down syndrome, but ""technology will advance to the point where noninvasive testing will encompass more of the less common genetic anomalies,"" she says. ""For women who are concerned about losing a pregnancy as a result of an invasive test, this is an excellent addition to our armamentarium of screening,"" she says. It is not a diagnostic test for Down syndrome, she says. It can help women put some of the information from other tests into context.",0,story_reviews_01247
"NEW YORK (Reuters Life!) - The herpes zoster vaccine could prevent tens of thousands of cases of shingles each year if it was offered to everyone who is eligible, with vaccinated adults half as likely to develop shingles, a study said. In 2006, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved a vaccine against shingles — a painful and potentially serious condition — for adults over 60. The vaccine has been tested, but never under real-world conditions in regular doctors' offices. The study, led by Hung Fu Tseng, a research scientist at Kaiser Permanente in Southern California, compared about 75,000 vaccinated members of the Kaiser Permanente Health plan with about 225,000 similarly aged members who weren't vaccinated. ""We didn't know how well the vaccine actually performed in the community setting,"" Tseng told Reuters Health. Shingles is a viral disease produced by the chicken pox virus, a common childhood disease, and is characterized by pain and a blistering rash along the nerves that have housed the dormant virus. Most shingles patients are older adults, but people with a weak immune system or those under stress may also develop it. Everyone in the study, published in the Journal of the American Medical Association, was at least 60 years old, and the researchers didn't include anybody for whom the live vaccine is not recommended. Using electronic health records, researchers tracked patients for up to three years after vaccination. About six out of every 1,000 people vaccinated got shingles each year, compared to 13 of every 1,000 unvaccinated patients. Researchers calculated that for every 71 people who were vaccinated, one case of shingles was prevented. But researchers cautioned that because they did not follow patients over the longer term, they didn't know how effective the vaccine is years later. Despite the FDA's approval, the vaccine has not caught on as much as some had hoped. Cost is one hurdle, with the vaccine sometimes costing up to $200 for people whose insurance doesn't cover it. It also requires stringent storage and handling. ""The human cost of shingles is enormous,"" said Michael Oxman, who studies infectious diseases at the University of California, San Diego, and was involved in a previous study of the vaccine. ""Adult medicine is really geared toward diagnosis and treatment of existing diseases. The adult medical community is not as attuned to preventing disease... as pediatricians are,"" he told Reuters Health. SOURCE: bit.ly/f2Kolv",0,story_reviews_01248
"More than 1 in 5 patients who receive an implantable defibrillator to prevent sudden death fall outside guidelines for the use of such devices and have about three times the risk of dying while hospitalized for the procedure as those who receive it within the guidelines, researchers said Tuesday. Although the absolute risk of dying is still low — less than 1% — such patients also endure longer hospitalizations and other complications and add substantially to the nation's healthcare costs, researchers from the Duke Clinical Research Institute in Durham, N.C., reported in the Journal of the American Medical Assn. ""The rate of [inappropriate] use was astonishingly higher than I expected,"" said Dr. Sana M. Al-Khatib, the lead researcher. ""There are some situations in which physicians think it is in the best interests of patients to get the devices in"" even when the guidelines don't call for it, she said. ""But even if you account for that, [more than 1 in 5] is surprising. We did not expect the number to be that high."" Advertisement The data also show clearly that there is a significant difference in the rate of inappropriate implants between electrophysiologists, who have specialized training in use of the devices, and other heart doctors, said Dr. Shephal Doshi, director of cardiac electrophysiology and pacing at Saint John's Health Center in Santa Monica, who was not involved in the research. Electrophysiologists appear to have ""a better understanding of the appropriateness"" of the use of the devices, Doshi said. Implantable defibrillators administer an electrical shock to a heart that is beating erratically to jolt it back into a normal rhythm. They can be lifesaving in appropriate patients. The devices cost $20,000 to $30,000, and normal hospitalization expenses can bring the total cost to $40,000 or more. In previous studies, Al-Khatib and her colleagues have examined underuse of the devices and found that many patients who could benefit from the defibrillators did not get them. This time, she said, ""we decided to look at the flip side."" The researchers examined a registry of implants maintained by the American College of Cardiology that covers an estimated 95% of all U.S. implants. Advertisement The team studied 111,707 implants for what is called primary prevention, performed between January 2006 and June 2009. Primary prevention is for patients who had not had a recent heart attack or a problem with the bottom chambers of the heart. The team found that 25,145 of the implants were for causes that were not covered by the guidelines. Of those, 9,257 were in patients who had had a heart attack within 40 days and 15,604 were in patients with newly diagnosed heart failure. These problems fall outside the guidelines because they have not been studied in clinical trials of the devices or because clinical trials have shown that the devices are not effective in treating them. Deaths in the hospital among patients receiving defibrillators outside the guidelines were 0.57%, compared with 0.18% among those who received them within the guidelines. About 3.23% of those receiving the devices outside guidelines had complications, compared with 2.41% of those within guidelines. The median length of a hospital stay was three days for those outside the guidelines, compared with one day for those within them. Doshi noted that the guidelines allowed some leeway for doctors to use their judgment. ""We do procedures based on experience and a sense of what is appropriate.... If we just practiced based on guidelines, we wouldn't need doctors. But clearly we need to understand this better."" Dr. Robert Ruelaz, an electrophysiologist at Hollywood Presbyterian Medical Center in Los Angeles, said there was a lot of self-imposed pressure on doctors who did implants because they care deeply about their patients, and that sometimes this might prompt them to step outside the guidelines in the hopes that the implants can help. ""Some people will probably try to say doctors are doing this to make more money,"" Ruelaz said. Most of the time, ""what I see is that doctors are concerned about protecting their patients from dying."" thomas.maugh@latimes.com",0,story_reviews_01259
"Enlarge By RANDY MAYOR, AP Stroke belt residents were 32% more likely to eat two or more servings of fried fish each week than those in the rest of the country. TWO SERVINGS OF FISH TWO SERVINGS OF FISH The American Heart Association recommends at least two servings of fish each week for heart health. Types rich in omega-3 fatty acids are best. These are essential fatty acids that humans get through foods, including fish, nuts and some oils such as canola and flaxseed. Scientists say the fatty acids are linked to heart health and brain function and may reduce inflammation. Research has shown omega-3 fatty acids decrease the risk of arrhythmias (abnormal heartbeats), which can lead to sudden death, and triglyceride levels. WHICH FISH SHOULD YOU CHOOSE? Most omega-3 rich: • Salmon • Mackerel • Herring • Lake trout • Sardines • Albacore tuna Less omega-3 rich: • Cod • Haddock • Catfish • Sole Source: Fadi Nahab, M.D., Emory University Hospital The steep rate of death from stroke in a swath of Southern states often referred to as America's ""stroke belt"" may be linked to a higher consumption of fried fish in that region, new research suggests. A study published in today's Neurology shows people living in the stroke belt — which comprises North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Tennessee, Arkansas and Louisiana — eat more fried fish and less non-fried fish than people living in the rest of the country, and African-Americans eat more fried fish than Caucasians. ""Differences in dietary fish consumption, specifically in cooking methods, may be contributing to higher rates of stroke in the stroke belt and also among African Americans,"" says study author Fadi Nahab, medical director for the Stroke Program at Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. The research, part of a large government-funded study, Reasons for Geographic and Racial Differences in Stroke (REGARDS), involved 21,675 participants from across the country; the average age was 65. Of the participants, 21% were from the ""stroke buckle,"" the coastal plain region of North Carolina, South Carolina and Georgia where stroke mortality rates are even higher than they are in the rest of the stroke belt. Another 34% were from the rest of the stroke belt and 44% were from the other states. Participants were interviewed by phone and then given an in-home physical exam. The questionnaire asked how often they ate oysters, shellfish, tuna, fried fish and non-fried fish. The American Heart Association recommends people eat fish high in omega-3 fatty acids—essential fatty acids humans get through their diet—at least twice a week, baked or grilled but not fried. Fewer than one in four overall ate two or more servings of non-fried fish a week. Stroke belt residents were 32% more likely to eat two or more servings of fried fish each week than those in the rest of the country. African-Americans were more than 3.5 times more likely to eat two or more servings of fried fish each week than Caucasians, with an overall average of about one serving per week of fried fish compared with about half a serving for Caucasians. When it came to eating non-fried fish meals, stroke belt residents ate an average of 1.45 servings per week, compared with 1.63 servings eaten by people elsewhere. ""This is good stuff. It's a well-done study, but I think one thing to bear in mind is that it's not specifically a study of stroke risk. You're looking at a community and seeing how it's behaving on the whole,"" says Daniel Labovitz, a stroke neurologist at Montefiore Medical Center in the Bronx. ""This study can't tell you causation. It can't tell you there's a direct link between one thing and another, it just tells you they're associated,"" says stroke neurologist Victor Urrutia, an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine. How might eating fried fish impact stroke? It could be that frying the fish leaches out the omega-3s, says Jeremy Lanford, stroke director at Scott & White Healthcare in Roundrock, Texas. Or the increased fat calorie content from the frying oil may contribute to stroke, says author Nahab. He also notes that fish used for frying, such as cod and haddock, tend to be the types lower in healthy fats. More research is needed to tease out whether cooking methods affect stroke risk, Labovitz says. ""In other words, is fried fish a problem, or is it another red herring?"" he says. The study was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, the National Institutes of Health, and the Department of Health and Human Services. Funding was provided by General Mills for coding of the food frequency questionnaire. Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - German researchers who used a bone marrow transplant to treat a cancer patient with the AIDS virus, have declared him cured of the virus — a stunning claim in a field where the word ""cure"" is barely whispered. People walk past a giant red ribbon set up on the facade of the ""Bird's Nest"" during a World AIDS Day event in Beijing November 30, 2008. REUTERS/Jason Lee The patient, who had both HIV infection and leukemia, received the bone marrow transplant in 2007 from a donor who had a genetic mutation known to give patients a natural immunity to the virus. Nearly four years after the transplant, the patient is free of the virus and it does not appear to be hiding anywhere in his body, Thomas Schneider of Berlin Charite hospital and colleagues said. ""Our results strongly suggest that cure of HIV has been achieved in this patient,"" they wrote in the journal Blood. AIDS researchers have rejected the approach on any kind of scale for patients with HIV. A bone marrow transplant is a last-ditch treatment for cancers such as leukemia. It requires destruction of a patient's own bone marrow — itself a harrowing process — and then a transplant from a donor who has a near-exact blood and immune system type. Months of recovery are needed while the transplant grows and reconstitutes the patient's immune system. ""It's not practical and it can kill people,"" said Dr. Robert Gallo of the Institute of Human Virology at the University of Maryland, who helped discover the human immunodeficiency virus that causes AIDS. ""It is possibly a cure, that's for sure, you won't know for absolute sure until the person dies and undergoes extreme PCR (genetic) analysis of post-mortem tissue."" The mutation affects a receptor, a cellular doorway, called CCR5, that the AIDS virus uses to get into the cells it infects. Since the 1990s scientists have known that some people, mostly of Northern European descent, have the mutation and are rarely infected with HIV. ""They are uninfectable, virtually,"" Gallo said. Some researchers are working on the idea of gene therapy to treat or try to cure HIV, but the technology is still in experimental stages. ""I don't want to throw cold water on an interesting thing, but that's what it is — an interesting thing,"" Gallo said. Schneider's team has been following the patient, taking samples from his colon, liver, spinal fluid and brain as he developed various conditions that justified the tests. They tested all these samples for evidence of the virus, which can be difficult to detect unless it is actively infecting cells. All these places are suspected ""reservoirs"" where HIV can hide out for years, to rebound in patients who stop taking drugs that suppress the infection. This patient appears to have a fully functioning immune system, they found, which appears genetically identical to cells from the donor — not the patient's own immune cells. Schneider's team found no evidence of HIV anywhere. ""From these results, it is reasonable to conclude that cure of HIV infection has been achieved in this patient,"" they wrote. The AIDS virus infects 33 million people globally and has killed more than 25 million since the pandemic began in the 1980s. Cocktails of strong drugs can suppress the virus, keeping patients healthy and reducing the chance they will infect others, but there is no vaccine.",0,story_reviews_01277

"En Español MONDAY, Dec. 6, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Long-term use of a daily low-dose aspirin dramatically cuts the risk of dying from a wide array of cancers, a new investigation reveals. Specifically, a British research team unearthed evidence that a low-dose aspirin (75 milligrams) taken daily for at least five years brings about a 10 percent to 60 percent drop in fatalities depending on the type of cancer. The finding stems from a fresh analysis of eight studies involving more than 25,500 patients, which had originally been conducted to examine the protective potential of a low-dose aspirin regimen on cardiovascular disease. The current observations follow prior research conducted by the same study team, which reported in October that a long-term regimen of low-dose aspirin appears to shave the risk of dying from colorectal cancer by a third. ""These findings provide the first proof in man that aspirin reduces deaths due to several common cancers,"" the study team noted in a news release. But the study's lead author, Prof. Peter Rothwell from John Radcliffe Hospital and the University of Oxford, stressed that ""these results do not mean that all adults should immediately start taking aspirin."" ""They do demonstrate major new benefits that have not previously been factored into guideline recommendations,"" he added, noting that ""previous guidelines have rightly cautioned that in healthy middle-aged people, the small risk of bleeding on aspirin partly offsets the benefit from prevention of strokes and heart attacks."" ""But the reductions in deaths due to several common cancers will now alter this balance for many people,"" Rothwell suggested. Rothwell and his colleagues published their findings Dec. 7 in the online edition of The Lancet. The research involved in the current review had been conducted for an average period of four to eight years. The patients (some of whom had been given a low-dose aspirin regimen, while others were not) were tracked for up to 20 years after. The authors determined that while the studies were still underway, overall cancer death risk plummeted by 21 percent among those taking low-dose aspirin. But the long-term benefits on some specific cancers began to show five years after the studies ended. At five years out, death due to gastrointestinal cancers had sunk by 54 percent among those patients taking low-dose aspirin. The protective impact of low-dose aspirin on stomach and colorectal cancer death was not seen until 10 years out, and for prostate cancer, the benefits first appeared 15 years down the road. Twenty years after first beginning a low-dose aspirin program, death risk dropped by 10 percent among prostate cancer patients; 30 percent among lung cancer patients (although only those with adenocarcinomas, the type typically seen in nonsmokers); 40 percent among colorectal cancer patients; and 60 percent among esophageal cancer patients. The potential impact of aspirin on pancreatic, stomach and brain cancer death rates was more problematic to gauge, the authors noted, due to the relative paucity of deaths from those specific diseases. They also found that higher doses of aspirin did not appear to boost the protective benefit. And while neither gender nor smoking history appeared to affect the impact of low-dose aspirin, age definitely did: the 20-year risk of death went down more dramatically among older patients. And while cautioning that more research is necessary to build on this ""proof of principle,"" the authors suggested that people who embark on a long-term, low-dose aspirin regimen in their late 40s and 50s are probably the ones who stand to benefit the most. Dr. Alan Arslan, an assistant professor in the departments of obstetrics and gynecology and environmental medicine at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City, described the findings as ""very significant."" ""[This] is the largest study to show that people who take aspirin for a long period of time have a reduced risk of death from many cancers, especially gastrointestinal cancers,"" he noted. ""The take-home message for patients is that if someone is taking low-dose or regular aspirin, it may put them at a reduced risk of death from cancer,"" Arslan added. ""However, if someone is not already taking aspirin they should talk with their physician before starting. Aspirin has risks of side effects, including bleeding and stroke.""

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - U.S. researchers are closing in on an accurate test for autism, a finding that could lead to earlier diagnosis and treatment. An autistic child peers from between curtains at the Consulting Centre for Autism in Amman, March 30, 2010. REUTERS/Ali Jarekji The test, which uses conventional magnetic resonance imaging or MRI machines, detected 94 percent of individuals with a high-functioning form of autism, they reported on Thursday. ""These results are the best yet in the search for a biological basis in terms of being able to distinguish those with and without the disease,"" said Nicholas Lange of Harvard Medical School, who directs the Neurostatistics Laboratory at McLean Hospital in Belmont, Massachusetts. He said the findings, published in the journal Autism Research, were very preliminary, but if confirmed in several more and larger studies, they might replace current subjective tests now used to diagnose the disorder. And, he said, they might also lead to better management and treatment of people with autism, a complex and mysterious brain disorder usually first diagnosed in early childhood. Autism is characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication, and understanding other people's emotions and behavior. For the study, researchers at McLean and a team led by Dr. Janet Lainhart the University of Utah used an MRI that was tuned to pick up microscopic features of the brain's wiring — a technique known as diffusion tensor imaging. ""You don't need any fancy equipment. This is performed around the world,"" Lange said in a telephone interview. The team did scans of this type on the brains of 30 people with autism and 30 people without. They found that the brain circuitry is significantly different in those with autism compared to people with normal brain function, specifically in areas of the brain that are engaged in language and social and emotional functioning. By measuring six aspects of the brain's circuitry, the test was able to correctly pick out people who had been diagnosed with autism with 94 percent accuracy. A repeat study using two different sets of subjects showed the same high level of performance. Lange said the findings should help make the process of diagnosing autism more scientific because it would rely on a test rather than a subjective assessment. And it may also offer an early diagnosis, which could help affected children get earlier intervention, when it is most likely to do some good. ""The basis of autism in the brain is very deep. There may be very little that one can actually change about the disorder for an individual with a severe case,"" Lange said. ""However, it has been shown that in the early stages of development, individuals have been aided by intense one-on-one caring to help them with language, social function with their peers and also with emotional problems,"" he said. Autism disorders are diagnosed in one in 110 children in the United States and affect four times as many boys as girls.",1,story_reviews_01292
"With calcium, adolescent girls may be the only group that is getting too little, the panel found. Older women, on the other hand, may take too much, putting themselves at risk for kidney stones . And there is evidence that excess calcium can increase the risk of heart disease, the group wrote. As for vitamin D, some prominent doctors have said that most people need supplements or they will be at increased risk for a wide variety of illnesses, including heart disease, cancer and autoimmune diseases. Photo And these days more and more people know their vitamin D levels because they are being tested for it as part of routine physical exams. ""The number of vitamin D tests has exploded,"" said Dennis Black, a reviewer of the report who is a professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California, San Francisco . At the same time, vitamin D sales have soared, growing faster than those of any supplement, according to The Nutrition Business Journal. Sales rose 82 percent from 2008 to 2009, reaching $430 million. ""Everyone was hoping vitamin D would be kind of a panacea,"" Dr. Black said. The report, he added, might quell the craze. ""I think this will have an impact on a lot of primary care providers,"" he said. The 14-member expert committee was convened by the Institute of Medicine, an independent nonprofit scientific body, at the request of the United States and Canadian governments. It was asked to examine the available data — nearly 1,000 publications — to determine how much vitamin D and calcium people were getting, how much was needed for optimal health and how much was too much. The two nutrients work together for bone health. Bone health, though, is only one of the benefits that have been attributed to vitamin D, and there is not enough good evidence to support most other claims, the committee said. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Some labs have started reporting levels of less than 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood as a deficiency. With that as a standard, 80 percent of the population would be deemed deficient of vitamin D, Dr. Rosen said. Most people need to take supplements to reach levels above 30 nanograms per milliliter, he added. But, the committee concluded, a level of 20 to 30 nanograms is all that is needed for bone health, and nearly everyone is in that range. Vitamin D is being added to more and more foods, said Paul R. Thomas of the Office of Dietary Supplements at the National Institutes of Health. Not only is it in orange juice and milk, but more is being added to breakfast cereals, and it now can be found in very high doses in supplement pills. Most vitamin D pills, he said, used to contain no more than 1,000 international units of it. Now it is easy to find pills, even in places like Wal-Mart , with 5,000 international units. The committee, though, said people need only 600 international units a day. Photo To assess the amounts of vitamin D and calcium people are getting, the panel looked at national data on diets. Most people, they concluded, get enough calcium from the foods they eat, about 1,000 milligrams a day for most adults (1,200 for women ages 51 to 70). Vitamin D is more complicated, the group said. In general, most people are not getting enough vitamin D from their diets, but they have enough of the vitamin in their blood, probably because they are also making it naturally after being out in the sun and storing it in their bodies. The American Society for Bone and Mineral Research and other groups applauded the report. It is ""a very balanced set of recommendations,"" said Dr. Sundeep Khosla, a Mayo Clinic endocrinologist and the society's president.

But Andrew Shao, an executive vice president at the Council for Responsible Nutrition, a trade group, said the panel was being overly cautious, especially in its recommendations about vitamin D. He said there was no convincing evidence that people were being harmed by taking supplements, and he said higher levels of vitamin D, in particular, could be beneficial. Such claims ""are not supported by the available evidence,"" the committee wrote. They were based on studies that observed populations and concluded that people with lower levels of the vitamin had more of various diseases. Such studies have been misleading and most scientists agree that they cannot determine cause and effect. It is not clear how or why the claims for high vitamin D levels started, medical experts say. First there were two studies, which turned out to be incorrect, that said people needed 30 nanograms of vitamin D per milliliter of blood, the upper end of what the committee says is a normal range. They were followed by articles and claims and books saying much higher levels — 40 to 50 nanograms or even higher — were needed. Advertisement Continue reading the main story After reviewing the data, the committee concluded that the evidence for the benefits of high levels of vitamin D was ""inconsistent and/or conflicting and did not demonstrate causality."" Evidence also suggests that high levels of vitamin D can increase the risks for fractures and the overall death rate and can raise the risk for other diseases. While those studies are not conclusive, any risk looms large when there is no demonstrable benefit. Those hints of risk are ""challenging the concept that ‘more is better,' "" the committee wrote. That is what surprised Dr. Black. ""We thought that probably higher is better,"" he said. He has changed his mind, and expects others will too: ""I think this report will make people more cautious.""",0,story_reviews_01296
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Women undergoing surgery for endometrial cancer can confidently opt for a minimally invasive hysterectomy performed by a skilled surgeon — with or without a robot's help — suggests a new review of surgical outcomes. The researchers found that the two advanced minimally invasive techniques led to similar results, and both appeared to be generally superior to the traditional open procedure. ""With minimally invasive surgery by an experienced surgeon's hands, the incisions are smaller, pain and suffering is less, visualization is better, and recovery is faster than with open surgery,"" Dr. Ceana Nezhat of the Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta who was not involved in the review, told Reuters Health. ""Robotics makes it easier for surgeons to transition from open to minimally invasive procedures,"" he added. More than 40,000 women are diagnosed with endometrial cancer in the U.S. every year. Treatment usually involves surgical removal of the uterus, known as hysterectomy. At the same time, lymph nodes are often removed to determine the stage of the cancer and whether further treatment is necessary. The research team from the Florida Hospital Cancer Institute, in Orlando, reviewed eight prior studies, including nearly 1,600 patients who underwent either an open, closed or robot-assisted hysterectomy and lymph node removal. In the open surgery, a relatively large incision is made in the abdominal wall. The closed procedure, known as laparoscopy, requires a much smaller cut, through which small instruments and a video camera are inserted. However, this minimally invasive approach also calls for significant training on the part of the surgeon to overcome challenges such as the counterintuitive movements involved in working from images on a TV monitor. Robotic-assisted surgery is similar to laparoscopy, only the instruments and cameras are integrated into robotic arms, which the surgeon operates through a control console. The robotic equipment provides better three-dimensional vision, increased range of motion and intuitive, downscaled movements, while adding a few thousand more dollars to the procedure's price tag, the authors note. ""Also with the computer-enhanced robotic technology, no matter how much coffee you drink in the morning, your movements don't have tremors,"" said Nezhat. Based on their review, the researchers found that minimally invasive surgeries done with a human hand and instruments or with robotic assistance equipment took around the same time and resulted in similarly long stays in the hospital. However, about half as much blood was lost when robots were enlisted than with standard laparoscopy. Both minimally invasive techniques resulted in longer-duration operations than open surgery. But both also led to shorter hospital stays and, in the case of robotic surgery, less blood-loss. Further, the average number of lymph nodes removed was about the same in the robotic and open procedures, suggesting that both approaches result in about equal surgeon accuracy in staging endometrial cancer. No differences between the three methods were seen in the numbers of complications, report the researchers in the journal Obstetrics & Gynecology. ""The robot will not really decrease human errors but it will make the surgery easier,"" Dr. Tommaso Falcone of the Cleveland Clinic, in Ohio, who was also not involved in the study, told Reuters Health in an e-mail. ""Robotics increases the chance that a hysterectomy can be done by laparoscopy,"" he added. ""However, if the surgeon is skilled enough to do the hysterectomy without the robot by laparoscopy then the outcomes will be similar."" Nezhat further noted that while robotic assistance can be a good ""enabler"" for a minimally invasive approach, surgeons should have at least the basic knowledge of regular laparoscopy too, as there may be times when the robotic equipment doesn't work. The reviewers point out that some of the differences found, such as the longer operation times for robotic-assisted surgery, may be due to surgeons' inexperience with the new tool and could improve over time. On the other hand, the newness of the technology could have deterred surgeons from using it for difficult cases, potentially biasing the results in a positive way for the robotic technique. Robotic surgery equipment only received U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval in 2005. More research is needed to be able to compare long-term outcomes, wrote the researchers. Nezhat advises women to look for a surgeon experienced in doing minimally invasive surgery. If a robot is to be enlisted, he recommends asking how the procedure would be performed if the robot is not available or if it doesn't work. ""Robotic-assisted surgery is in its infancy, and it definitely has a future,"" said Nezhat. ""Its benefits should offset its higher costs.""

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - There may be a seed of truth amidst the many health claims for pomegranate juice, researchers from Israel said Thursday, at least for kidney patients on dialysis. They found that such patients who gulped a few cups of the tart liquid every week lowered their chances of infections, the second-leading killer of the more than 350,000 Americans on dialysis. The findings were presented at the American Society of Nephrology's meeting in Denver — aka Renal Week — and have not yet been vetted by independent experts. ""It's a very intriguing study,"" said Dr. Frank Brosius, who heads the nephrology division at the University of Michigan Health System and was not involved in the research. ""I certainly don't know of anything else that would have such a profound effect,"" he told Reuters Health, cautioning at the same time that the study needed to be replicated by other centers. The results come in the wake of a U.S. crackdown on allegedly false advertising by POM Wonderful, which claims its pomegranate products can help everything from heart disease to prostate cancer and erectile dysfunction. The Israeli researchers, led by Dr. Batya Kristal of Western Galilee Hospital in Nahariya, did not use POM juice, but a brand sold by Naturafood. In lab tests, Kristal told Reuters Health, that brand ranked highest in polyphenol antioxidants, which can reduce cell damage caused by so-called free radicals. Antioxidants are found in different levels in fruits and vegetables, such as blueberries or broccoli. ""Pomegranate juice was shown in the last three years to contain the highest levels of polyphenols among a variety of products,"" Kristal said. ""Much higher than red wine, for instance."" The researchers figured an antioxidant-rich diet might help patients with kidney failure, because the level of free radicals in their blood increases as the blood circulates through the dialysis device. That, in turn, may rev up inflammation in their tissues. In the study, funded by the Israeli Ministry of Health, 101 patients were randomly assigned to either a concoction without pomegranate juice, or the real thing. After downing about half a cup three times a week over a year, those who drank the real thing had a reduction of inflammatory molecules in their blood. They also made fewer trips to the hospital. ""We found significant reductions in hospitalization due to infections, with more than 40 percent reduction in the first hospitalization and 80 percent in the second,"" said Kristal. However, the researchers were only able to rule out chance as the cause of the reduction in the second visit to the hospital. According to the findings, among 50 patients drinking pomegranate juice for a year, about two would have to go to the hospital at least twice. By comparison, that number would be nearly 11 in patients not drinking the juice. The researchers say they don't know if their results extend to other brands as well, and suggest squeezing your own juice. A 16-oz bottle of POM Wonderful sells for about $4. She said her team had found no side effects, but added that kidney patients should be aware of the high potassium content in the juice, given the delicate balance of nutrients in their blood, and talk to their doctor if they consider drinking it. Brosius was skeptical of the benefits, although he said the juice was unlikely to cause harm. ""I would prefer to see this validated at other centers before we come out and say this is the thing to do,"" he said. Even if the findings hold up, he said, it is still unclear what accounts for them. ""Who the heck knows what the active ingredients are?"" Marion Nestle, a nutrition expert at New York University, said the effects might not be unique to pomegranate juice. ""This study does not demonstrate anything special about pomegranate juice,"" she told Reuters Health in an e-mail. ""The effects of juice were compared to a placebo, not to any other kind of juice that might have exactly the same effect."" ""The pomegranate people are spending millions to prove what I could have told them in the first place,"" she added. ""Pomegranate juices — like most if not all fruit and vegetable juices — have antioxidant activity. Does this make pomegranates better than any other fruit? Investigators have yet to show this.""",0,story_reviews_01304
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - Men who underwent heart bypass surgery and consumed about two drinks a day afterward had fewer subsequent cardiovascular procedures than those who abstained, according to a study released Sunday. Light alcohol consumption was associated with a 25 percent reduction in additional heart procedures, heart attacks or strokes in the study by Italian researchers, presented at the annual meeting of the American Heart Association in Chicago. ""The benefit of light amounts of alcohol consumption has been documented in healthy individuals, but our analysis showed a benefit from light alcohol intake in post-coronary bypass patients,"" said Dr. Umberto Benedetto, of the University of Rome La Sapienza. However, bypass patients with a condition called left ventricular dysfunction who were heavy drinkers, defined as having more than six drinks daily, were twice as likely to die from heart problems, the study found. The Italian researchers used a questionnaire to compare alcohol consumption in 1,021 men who underwent heart bypass surgery and reviewed their medical history for 3-1/2 years. The study also found no adverse correlation between moderate alcohol consumption and any medication. The American Heart Association recommends men limit themselves to two drinks a day and women to one drink a day, because too much alcohol can raise blood pressure and have other negative effects.",0,story_reviews_01320
"There is only ""moderate'' evidence that the newly approved prostate cancer drug Provenge helps patients, according to an analysis done for Medicare that was made public on Wednesday. The analysis is part of a controversial review by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services to determine whether to pay for Provenge, which costs $93,000 per patient and extended lives by about four months in clinical trials. Medicare advisers will meet next Wednesday to discuss the drug, which was developed by Dendreon, a Seattle-based biotechnology company. Provenge is the first so-called therapeutic cancer vaccine – meaning it works by training the patient's immune system to attack the tumor – to win F.D.A. approval. The treatment is made for each patient from his own blood. Sales have been small so far because Dendreon's manufacturing capacity has been limited. While Medicare generally pays for drugs that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration, its debate over paying for Provenge has raised concerns among some cancer patients, doctors and investors who say the government is sending a warning shot that it will not automatically pay for high-priced medicines. ""Not only is C.M.S.'s action contrary to Congress's intent to ensure beneficiary access to drugs and biologicals used in an anticancer chemotherapeutic regimen, but it threatens to stifle future innovation and cancer research for years to come,'' Dr. Al B. Benson III, president of the Association of Community Cancer Centers, said in a comment submitted to the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. But others say the health care system cannot afford to continue paying high prices for all therapies, particularly cancer drugs that extend lives by only a few months. With expensive medicines there is already a sort of dual approval system, especially with private insurance companies. First a drug must get F.D.A. approval and then a manufacturer often must go through a lengthy process of persuading insurers to pay for the drug. Medicare is not supposed to consider price when determining whether to cover a drug, however. Some analysts have assumed that Medicare will pay for Provenge when used for the patients specified in the drug's label – those with advanced prostate cancer that is resistant to hormone-deprivation therapy but who are experiencing no or minimal symptoms. The Medicare review might be more designed to limit off-label use of the expensive drug, such as for patients who already have symptoms. The review for Medicare said there was insufficient evidence to judge whether Provenge would work if used off-label. The F.D.A. declined to approve Provenge in 2007, setting off protests by patients and Dendreon investors. After Dendreon completed another trial, which reaffirmed a survival advantage for the drug, Provenge was approved this April. But the analysis for Medicare said that there were issues in how the trials were designed that made it difficult to assess how effective Provenge really was. One big issue was that the placebo used in the control arm was not really inert. Robyn Karnauskas, a biotechnology analyst at Deutsche Bank, said in a note to clients Wednesday that the assessment of moderate evidence in support of Provenge boded well for reimbursement. ""Historically, moderate means that CMS will reimburse the product for its on-label indication,'' she wrote. Dendreon's shares rose more than 5 percent in trading after the close of the market. The assessment was done by a technology evaluation group at the Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association under contract to the government's Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality.",0,story_reviews_01322
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Screening smokers and former smokers for lung tumors using three-dimensional X-rays reduced their risk of dying from lung cancer by 20 percent, researchers said on Thursday. Computed tomography (CT) scan of the abdomen; drawing shows the patient on a table that slides through the CT machine, which takes x-ray pictures of the inside of the body. REUTERS/© 2005 Terese Winslow, U.S. Govt. has certain rights/Handout The study sponsored by the U.S. National Cancer Institute is the first to show that people can be screened for lung cancer, akin to mammograms for breast cancer and tests for colon and prostate cancer. ""Nothing has ever shown a 20 percent decrease in mortality in this disease ever before. This is huge,"" said Regina Vidaver, executive director of the National Lung Cancer Partnership. The researchers said their findings could save thousands of lives. Lung cancer kills 1.2 million people a year globally and it will kill 157,000 people in the United States alone this year, according to the American Cancer Society. The trial of more than 53,000 current and former heavy smokers, aged 55 to 74, found the ""spiral"" CT scans apparently catch tumors before they have spread. ""To me this is a game changer,"" Vidaver said in a telephone interview. ""We will have what breast cancer has now, which is a lot of survivors."" The researchers have some caveats. They do not know whether the radiation from the CT scans may raise the risk of cancer, and they do not know what the study means for light smokers, younger people, or those who have never smoked. It is also possible the scans will turn up tumors that would never have killed the patients, and that some people will undergo unnecessary surgery if they are screened. It is not clear when or how guidelines for lung cancer screening could be drawn up, and until they are, insurers including government programs such as Medicare are unlikely to pay the average $300 cost of a scan. For the study, the middle-aged and elderly smokers were scanned with either a spiral CT or a chest X-ray once a year for three years starting in August 2002. They were followed for five years. The researchers waited until an independent panel could document a 20 percent reduction in cancer deaths, or could determine that there was no significant benefit. As of last month, 354 people who got CTs had died of lung cancer, compared to 442 who got ordinary X-rays. This worked out to a 20.3 percent lower risk of dying for the spiral CT group, and researchers stopped the study. EARLY DIAGNOSIS Caught early, lung cancer can be cured surgically, but it causes vague symptoms and usually is not diagnosed until it has spread. Only 15 percent of lung cancer patients live 5 years or more. ""No one should come away from this announcement believing that it is safe to continue to smoke,"" National Cancer Institute director Dr. Harold Varmus told a news conference. ""This screening does not prevent lung cancer and it does not protect the large majority of subjects from death by lung cancer,"" Varmus said. Dr. Bruce Johnson of the Dana Farber Cancer Institute in Boston, who is on the board of the American Society of Clinical Oncology, said he doubted most people would see the findings as a green light to smoke. ""The majority of lung cancer diagnoses in the United States now are either in people who never smoked or in people who have quit,"" Johnson said. In 2006, Dr. Claudia Henschke of New York Presbyterian Hospital-Weill Cornell Medical Center caused a stir when she published a study saying that 80 percent of lung-cancer deaths could be prevented through widespread use of spiral CT. Her ideas were controversial to start with and widely disregarded when other researchers found her work had been paid for by a tobacco company. Almost all advanced CT scanners can perform a spiral CT, and about 60 percent of U.S. hospitals have such a machine. Makers include General Electric Co's GE Healthcare Siemens AG, Toshiba Corp, Hitachi and Philips. A fact sheet on spiral CT can be found here",0,story_reviews_01331
"(Health.com) -- The makers of POM Wonderful pomegranate juice say that the drink improves blood flow and heart health, prevents and treats prostate cancer, and works 40 percent as well as Viagra (whatever that means). All for about four bucks a bottle. Those impressive claims helped the company rack up $91 million in sales in 2009. They also earned the disapproval of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC). Last month, the agency sued POM Wonderful for making ""false and unsubstantiated"" health claims, and is asking the company to remove the claims from its ads. A 100 percent juice drink that contains antioxidants (and no added sugar), POM is just one of many beverages that bill themselves as promoting better health. VitaminWater, kombucha tea, coconut water, and various brands of juice drinks made from acai, goji berry, and mangosteen have all used health claims in their marketing -- and some, like POM, have been the subject of scrutiny and legal action. The FTC, along with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), has been cracking down on food and beverage makers for allegedly overselling the health benefits of their products. In 2009 alone, the FDA warned 17 companies that they were providing misleading nutritional information on their packaging or making overly specific health claims. Health.com: 25 diet-busting foods you should never eat Not all of the products were drinks, but ""the beverage category stands out,"" says Bruce Silverglade, director of legal affairs at the Center for Science in the Public Interest, a consumer advocacy group based in Washington, D.C. ""At first blush it seems that beverage products are certainly a large proportion of food products that make bogus health-related claims."" Drinks such as POM have become increasingly popular with consumers in recent years, thanks in part to public health campaigns against soda that have been prompted by the obesity epidemic. ""The trend is away from traditional soda pop [toward] products claiming to provide magical health benefits,"" Silverglade says. Are the health claims true? Yes and no. The federal government doesn't require companies to vet health claims with the agency before plastering them on product packaging (as long as the claims are accompanied by a disclaimer about their uncertainty). But that doesn't mean the claims are invented -- most are based in research. The research is often funded by the manufacturers, however, and industry-funded research can be prone to bias. A 2007 study found that research on health drinks that was funded entirely by beverage companies was between four and eight times more likely to find a favorable result than research with no industry support. ""If a cell phone company told you they tested all the models and their model came out the best, would you believe it? Probably not,"" says Dr. Lenard Lesser, M.D., one of the co-authors of that study and a researcher at UCLA. ""The same is true with nutrition research, but the stakes are higher because we're putting our bodies at risk."" Where's the line between research and marketing? Sounds great, hard to believe However far-fetched the claims may sound, POM is standing behind them. (Two weeks before the FTC publicly announced its lawsuit, POM preemptively sued the FTC, claiming that preapproval of ads featuring health claims violates the company's right to free speech.) But are shoppers really convinced that POM can unclog their arteries, cure cancer, and lead to hotter sex? There seem to be more than a few believers out there. "" I started drinking POM after reading the studies two years ago, my triglycerides were almost 1000!,"" one of POM Wonderful's 12,000 fans breathlessly posted on Facebook after the FTC announced its lawsuit. ""Working out everyday, drinking POM, and eating healthy, they are now less than 400. Forget what the Feds say! I believe!!!"" (A triglycerides level of 400 is still nearly three times higher than what's considered normal.) Most health beverage drinkers aren't as enthusiastic as the realtor from Alaska who posted the above testimonial. Quinton Ma, a 22-year-old marketing coordinator at Gawker Media, in New York City, started to drink VitaminWater as a middle schooler because it seemed like a healthy alternative to soda. ""I figured that if they were selling something that I could get extra vitamins from, it couldn't hurt to drink,"" Ma says. ""Once I learned they were really just cleverly marketed sugar waters, I stopped."" Health.com: You are what you drink But the fact is, even when people don't buy the health claims they often still buy the beverage. That's the paradox of products such as POM, Silverglade says: The health claims on these products strain the imagination, yet studies have repeatedly shown that health claims sell food. That's because these claims -- however improbable they may seem -- distract shoppers from the real nutritional information and hook consumers with buzzwords like ""antioxidant."" This phenomenon is known as a ""health halo,"" an aura of healthfulness attached to a product based on labels like ""low-fat"" ""all-natural"" or ""made with whole grains"" that seduces consumers into overeating. According to a study by the FTC, this halo effect can even lead people to overlook warning statements -- about the high sodium content of a product, for example. ""A healthy halo develops around products like these,"" says Frances Largeman-Roth, R.D., Health magazine's senior food and nutrition editor. ""The health-conscious consumer incorporates them into their lifestyle, thinking that they're doing a world of good for themselves."" Health.com: Food label know-how: 5 mistakes even savvy shoppers make Ceating a health halo The makers of POM Wonderful have spent $34 million on scientific research on POM products and pomegranates. According to the FTC's complaint, the studies POM has funded do not substantiate the company's claims, and a closer look at the research seems to bear that out. One of the most prominent claims, that POM can decrease arterial plaque by 30 percent, was taken from a single pilot study that included just 19 people and was funded by the makers of POM. Another claim, that POM drinkers experience a 17 percent improvement in blood flow, was taken from another POM-funded study that included just 45 people and only lasted for three months. ""These days it's possible for a food company to pay just about anybody to conduct a study,"" says Silverglade. Michael Aviram, Ds.C., a cholesterol researcher at Rambam Medical Center, in Haifa, Israel, defended his studies on pomegranates -- many of them funded by POM -- by noting that they were published in ""very prestigious peer reviewed journals,"" including the American Journal of Clinical Nutrition and Atherosclerosis. Dr. Harley Liker, M.D., a physician at UCLA Medical Center who has also led research funded by POM, directed all inquiries to a POM spokesman. ""A grocery store is a designed marketing environment to get people to buy things,"" says Lesser. ""Lots of products are going to try to use health claims from research, often from their own industry, [just] to sell a product."" Health.com: 14 health products you probably don't need Iffy health claims don't mean that products like pomegranate juice should be avoided at all costs, says Keri Gans, R.D., a spokesperson for the American Dietetic Association. As long as consumers limit themselves to 8-ounce servings and products with no added sugar, juice can be an excellent source of vitamins and other nutrients, Gans says. But it's ""not going to solve any of your health issues,"" she adds. The bottom line is that consumers shouldn't believe everything they read on labels. ""If they focus on consuming an overall well-balanced diet, they might not need to focus so much on finding a product that makes false promises,"" Gans says.

"En Español SUNDAY, Oct. 24, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Bitter taste receptors are located in the lungs as well as on the tongue, a finding that might lead to improved treatments for asthma and other obstructive lung diseases, according to researchers at the University of Maryland School of Medicine in Baltimore. ""The detection of functioning taste receptors on smooth muscle of the bronchus in the lungs was so unexpected that we were at first quite skeptical ourselves,"" said the study's senior author, Dr. Stephen B. Liggett, professor of medicine and physiology and director of the university's cardiopulmonary genomics program, in a university news release. The receptors in the lungs -- which the team found by accident in an unrelated study -- are the same as those on the tongue. But the tongue's receptors are clustered in taste buds that send signals to the brain, while the receptors in the lungs are not grouped in buds and don't send signals to the brain, explained the research team. However, they still respond to bitter tastes. The researchers tested different bitter compounds on human and mouse airways, individual airway smooth muscle cells, and on mice with asthma. They found that these compounds all opened lung airways more profoundly than current drugs. The study appears online Oct. 24 in the journal Nature Medicine. ""New drugs to treat asthma, emphysema or chronic bronchitis are needed. This could replace or enhance what is now in use, and represents a completely new approach,"" said Liggett. But, he added, simply eating bitter-tasting foods or compounds won't help people with asthma. ""Based on our research, we think that the best drugs would be chemical modifications of bitter compounds, which would be aerosolized and then inhaled into the lungs with an inhaler,"" he said. The research, which is preliminary, was supported by grants from the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute of the National Institutes of Health.

"Experimental Therapy For Sore Heels Has Skeptics toggle caption Richard Knox/NPR Dressed in street clothes, Tara Cassidy Driscoll lies face-down on an examining table at the Massachusetts General Hospital. Orthopedic surgeon George Theodore is about to blast her foot with powerful shock waves generated by sound. After numbing her foot with Novocain, Theodore turns on an expensive German-made machine that beams tightly focused sound energy at Cassidy Driscoll's heel, near the point where her painful plantar fascia attaches to the heel bone. Suddenly the room is filled with the rhythmic click-click-click of a metronome. It's a kind of paradox: Theodore is damaging her foot in order to heal it. ""The shocks are like a little baseball bat hitting the tissue,"" Theodore says. ""It's producing a little bit of a repair process -- a little microbleeding."" The healing process takes place over several months after the shock-wave therapy, which Theodore does in a single treatment. [Other centers use lower-energy shock waves over several treatments.] Theodore has been doing the shock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis for about eight years, after longer experiences in Europe. It's the same technology used since the 1980s to blast kidney stones, an application called lithotripsy, but for foot problems doctors use less intense shock waves. Shock-wave therapy for plantar fasciitis is beginning to catch on around the U.S., partly since this stubborn type of foot pain is so common -- and so difficult to treat. Nearly 2 million Americans seek care for plantar fasciitis (pronounced PLAN-tar FASH-ee-EYE-tus) every year. Theodore tells Cassidy Driscoll that shock-wave therapy gives her a 60 to 80 percent chance of reducing her pain by half; about one-quarter of patients will become pain-free from the treatment. After the 20-minute treatment, Cassidy Driscoll says she felt no pain, only a sort of tapping. She gets off the table, walks out of Theodore's office and drives herself home. Two days later, she says her foot felt bruised, but she didn't have enough pain to require medication. toggle caption Richard Knox/NPR Cassidy Driscoll will pay $1,000 for the treatment. Elsewhere the charge can range from $500 to several thousand dollars. But most insurers won't pay for it, because they consider it experimental. Studies have given conflicting results, partly because there's no standardized way of doing shock-wave therapy. Different doctors use different sources of energy, different doses and a differing number of treatments. ""Is it rock-solid science that everyone agrees on? I would say no,"" says Dr. Naven Duggal, another Harvard orthopedic surgeon at Boston's Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center. Duggal is not impressed with reported success rates. ""Sixty to 80 percent [success] for something that somebody's not going to get guaranteed pain relief -- in my mind, it's not something I would go for,"" Duggal says. Duggal says foot specialists don't really know what causes the pain of plantar fasciitis. The plantar fascia is a tough, rubber-band-like structure on the bottom of the foot. It has to be strong, because every time the foot strikes the ground, the plantar fascia bears the body's full weight. In high-impact activities like running, the forces even exceed the actual weight because it's so concentrated in a narrow spot where the fascia attaches to the heel bone. That's presumably why sufferers of plantar fasciitis feel the pain in the heel. toggle caption Richard Knox/NPR Concepts of what plantar fasciitis is have changed in recent years. Doctors used to think it occurred because the fascia became inflamed –- in fact, the suffix ""-itis"" denotes inflammation. But while inflammation can be involved in plantar fasciitis, it doesn't seem to be the cause, Duggal says. Many think that plantar fasciitis is caused by heel spurs, bony hook-like growths that develop on many people's heels due to stress. But specialists don't think that anymore. As ideas of what plantar fasciitis is change, so have treatments. Doctors don't do surgery for it anymore except in rare cases, largely because they've found surgery often makes people worse off. ""Patients have to be patient,"" Duggal says. ""They have to understand that this condition unfortunately is not fully understood."" He's interested in another experimental treatment that's just entering clinical trials. It's called platelet-rich plasma, and it involves isolating blood cells called platelets from patients' own blood and injecting them into the plantar fascia. Though platelets are best known for their role in initiating blood clots, they also contain growth factors. So the hope is that platelet injections will stimulate healing without the damaging effects of shock-wave therapy. But it will be some years before that approach is proven -- or not. Meanwhile, foot specialists and their patients are left with a smattering of low-tech treatments that they say all plantar fasciitis patients should try, whether or not they eventually go on to shock-wave therapy. These methods include: -- Stretching the foot several times a day -- Icing the bottom of the foot, sometimes using ice to massage the heel area -- Using cups made of gel in shoes to cushion the heel (and many orthopedic surgeons say expensive custom-made orthotics are not necessary) -- Wearing a night splint, a simple brace that holds the foot in a flexed position to keep the plantar fascia stretched during sleep -- Physical therapy, though some studies indicate that some PT practices such as ultrasound and whirlpool are not helpful -- Use of NSAID (non-steroidal anti-inflammatory) drugs such as ibuprofen and naproxen -- Corticosteroid injections into the heel, though this is controversial and should not be used repeatedly -- Wearing a ""walking cast"" -- Weight loss -- Taping the foot during exercise -- Backing off activities like running until the pain goes away, and then reinitiating them gradually About 90 percent of sufferers will get better with time. Duggal says he advises patients to try a combination of these measures for at least a year. Karen Firestone, a 54-year-old Boston businesswoman and avid runner, says that techniques like stretching, icing and taping were effective for her. She started having plantar fascia pain last summer, and on Duggal's advice has been diligent about doing everything she can to heal the problem. ""The stretching, the icing, the taping -- I do all these little pieces of help for my body, and it responds,"" Firestone says. ""So I think people should take that message and go with it."" After a few months, she's back to running -- but shorter distances. And she stops whenever her heel pain acts up.",0,story_reviews_01353
"Oct. 18, 2010 -- An analysis of 22 studies involving about 2.5 million people shows a significant association between using cholesterol-lowering drugs called statins and a reduced risk for colorectal cancer. The analysis shows there was a 12% reduction of colorectal cancer risk among statin users. Also, the longer patients used statin drugs, the greater their reduction in risk for colorectal cancer. The findings are based on a review of 22 studies published through October 2009 and were presented at the American College of Gastroenterology's (ACG) 75th Annual Scientific meeting in San Antonio. Study researcher N. Jewel Samadder, MD, MSc, from the University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, says the relationship between statin use and a reduction in risk for colorectal cancer was consistent across various study designs. ""This effect was largely consistent across study design with both case control and cohort studies showing a strong correlation,"" he says in a news release. ""The length of statin use, both greater than six months and greater than five years of use was associated with reduction in colorectal cancer risk."" The group of statins that showed the greatest effect in reducing risk are classified as lipophilic: atorvastatin (Lipitor), fluvastatin (Lescol), lovastatin (Altocor, Altoprev, Mevacor), pitavastatin (Livalo), and simvastatin (Zocor), Colorectal cancer is the third most common type of cancer in the U.S.; 102,900 new cases of colon cancer are diagnosed in men and women every year, and about 39,670 new cases of rectal cancer are diagnosed annually. The relationship between statins and cancer is unclear, but other research exploring the impact of statins at the molecular level suggests that these cholesterol-lowering drugs may help control the development of tumor, as well as tumor growth. ""Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,"" says Samadder in the news release. ""Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted."" This study was presented at a medical conference. The findings should be considered preliminary as they have not yet undergone the ""peer review"" process, in which outside experts scrutinize the data prior to publication in a medical journal.",0,story_reviews_01355
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Statin drugs may lower the risk of colon cancer by as much as 12 percent, U.S. researchers reported on Monday. The longer people took the highly popular cholesterol-lowering pills, the lower their risk of later developing colon cancer, the researchers told a meeting of the American College of Gastroenterology. Many researchers have found that statin drugs, which include Pfizer Inc's Lipitor and AstraZeneca Plc's Crestor, have effects far beyond lowering cholesterol and reducing the risk of heart disease. ""Observational studies have suggested that long-term use of statins is associated with reduced risk of several cancers, including breast, prostate, lung, pancreas and liver,"" said Dr. Jewel Samadder of the University of Michigan at Ann Arbor, who led the study. ""Our findings suggest that randomized controlled trials designed to test the hypothesis that statins reduce the risk of colorectal cancer are warranted,"" Samadder added in a statement. Samadder's team did what is known as a meta-analysis, combining the findings of 22 scientific studies with more than 2.5 million volunteers. Overall, patients who took statins had a 12 percent lower risk of being diagnosed with colon cancer than people who did not take the drugs, they found. Statins are not risk-free. In May, British researchers reported that patients taking them have a higher risks of liver dysfunction, kidney failure, muscle weakness and cataracts. And U.S. health officials have been watching data that suggests some statins such as Merck & Co's blockbuster drug Vytorin may actually raise the risk of cancer, although they have saidf this is unlikely.",1,story_reviews_01356
"LONDON (Reuters) - A protein in urine could be a strong indicator of prostate cancer risk, according to British scientists who say their findings could one day be developed into a quick and simple test for the disease. Medical equipment sits in labelled bins inside of a doctor's office in New York in this March 17, 2010 file photo. REUTERS/Lucas Jackson Scientists from the Cancer Research UK Cambridge Research Institute and the Institute of Cancer Research (ICR) said the protein, called microseminoprotein-beta or MSMB, is found at reduced levels in men diagnosed with the disease and are also lower in men with more aggressive forms of the cancer. ""The protein is easy to detect because it is found in urine and would potentially be a very simple test to carry out on men to identify those most at risk of developing the disease,"" said Hayley Whitaker of the Cambridge institute, who led the study. Whitaker said that while it could be around five years before the results of this study are translated into a test for doctors to use in clinics, she hoped it would then also help them to determine which patients have aggressive tumors. Prostate cancer killed an estimated 258,000 men around the world in 2008 and is the second most common cause of cancer death in men in the United States. In Britain, around 35,000 men are diagnosed with it and some 10,000 die from the disease. The most effective screening tests currently available are based on a single biomarker called prostate specific antigen (PSA). But PSA testing is problematic because it has low specificity, which generates high false positive rates and leads to unnecessary surgical and radiotherapy treatment. A U.S. study published last year found that routine PSA prostate screening has resulted in more than one million American men being diagnosed with tumors who might otherwise have suffered no ill effects from them. ""At the moment, PSA testing is the best method we have to detect prostate cancer but it has significant limitations, so there is an urgent need to find new biomarkers such as MSMB that could be used in screening and diagnosis,"" said Rosalind Eeles of the ICR and The Royal Marsden Hospital, who also worked on the study. The protein — which regulates prostate cell death — is produced by normal prostate cells. The scientists took tissue and urine samples from around 350 men both with and without prostate cancer to test MSMB levels. The results, published in the Public Library of Science (PLoS) ONE journal, showed that MSMB is found at significantly lower levels in the urine of men diagnosed with prostate cancer than those without the disease. They also showed men with aggressive tumors were also likely to have lower levels of the protein in their urine. Commenting on the study, Kate Holmes of the UK's Prostate Cancer Charity, said they could prove very valuable in future. ""Given the known limitations of the PSA blood test, finding a technique to accurately diagnose prostate cancer is the Holy Grail of research into the disease,"" she said in a statement. ""An accurate, reliable urine test for prostate cancer would be an invaluable tool if it is proven to be successful on a large scale.""",0,story_reviews_01363
"MILAN (Reuters) - An established targeted therapy for bowel cancer may also help women with an aggressive form of breast cancer, a mid-stage clinical study revealed on Monday, opening up a potential new market for the medicine. Adding Erbitux to cisplatin, a platinum-based chemotherapy, doubled the tumor response rate and the length of time patients lived without their disease worsening, compared with giving cisplatin on its own, in the Phase II trial. ""We are very excited by these results,"" lead researcher Jose Baselga of the Massachusetts General Hospital Cancer Center in Boston told the European Society for Medical Oncology (ESMO) — Europe's biggest cancer meeting. Erbitux — from Merck KGaA, Eli Lilly and Bristol-Myers Squibb — is approved for bowel and head and neck cancer. Sales last year were $1.7 billion. An independent Nordic study, published at ESMO on Sunday, revealed 566 patients who were given Erbitux plus a three-drug chemotherapy regimen called FLOX, in first-line treatment for bowel cancer, did not live longer or gain any significant extra benefit to those on chemotherapy alone. BREAST CANCER BREAKTHROUGH It is the first time researchers have shown that a drug like Erbitux, which targets a protein called epidermal growth factor involved in cancer cell growth, can provide substantial benefit in difficult-to-treat ""triple negative"" breast cancer. Women with triple negative breast cancer have tumors that do not respond to two types of hormonal therapy, or drugs that target a protein called HER-2. The disease tends to spread through the body rapidly and there are few treatment options, though Sanofi-Aventis has a promising drug in late-stage development. The Phase II study included 173 women whose cancer had spread and who had received other treatments. The best overall tumor response rate, of 20 percent, was in those given Erbitux. This compared with 10 percent among those on cisplatin alone. Erbitux, known generically as cetuximab, also more than doubled the median time before the patients' disease worsened, to 3.7 months from 1.5 months. Baselga said that level of improvement was rarely seen in this advanced-disease population and was highly promising. ""This study clearly opens the field ... I am convinced that cetuximab or other anti-EGFR agents have a role in triple negative breast cancer. No question,"" he said. MISSED TARGET Still, further studies will be needed to build the case, including testing Erbitux alongside other types of chemotherapy, he added, noting the Phase II study did not meet its primary objective of proving a greater than 20 percent response rate. Dr. Fabrice Andre from Institut Gustave Roussy in Villejuif, France, who was not involved in the research, said the results were ""extremely important"" but echoed the view that the findings now had to be confirmed in larger-scale clinical tests. In practice, experts suspect triple negative breast cancer represents a number of different disease sub-groups and that analyzing patients according to the molecular profile of their tumors may help identify a sub-group that could benefit most. Wolfgang Wein, head of oncology at German drugmaker Merck, welcomed the latest findings, which could broaden the market for the company's key medicine. Merck suffered a setback last year when its attempts to win marketing approval to sell Erbitux in lung cancer were rebuffed by regulators.",0,story_reviews_01367
"Corbis A glass of wine or two a week — and not more than one large glass on any occasion — may be safe during pregnancy, according to a large study just published in the Journal of Epidemiology and Community Health. The British research found no negative effects of such light drinking on 5-year-olds whose mothers had imbibed while pregnant with them. Indeed, these kindergartners were slightly less likely to have behavioral problems and performed somewhat better on cognitive tests than children whose mothers had abstained. (More on Time.com: 5 Pregnancy Taboos Explained (or Debunked)) But this does *not* mean that light drinking in pregnancy is good for your baby. When researchers controlled for factors like maternal education and income, which tend to be higher in light drinkers, it significantly reduced the positive effects associated with alcohol. For example, before adjusting for these kinds of differences between the groups, the researchers found that light drinking was connected with 33% lower rates of overall behavior problems in boys — after the adjustment, that effect fell to 23%. The study did find negative effects in children whose mothers drank moderately: this was defined as not having more than 3 to 6 British units of alcohol per week or more than 3 to 5 units on a single occasion. (One British unit of alcohol equals a small glass of wine.) Heavier drinking in pregnancy, not surprisingly, resulted in increased levels of behavior problems and lowered cognitive performance among children. The research included 11,513 children participating in a large U.K. study. The authors had earlier published similar results looking at the data for children in the study when they were 3, finding those whose mothers who didn't drink had slightly more behavior problems and slightly poorer performance on mental tests than kids born to light drinkers; the results also showed increasingly negative effects of alcohol going from moderate to heavy drinking. Other research has repeatedly shown that heavy, binging patterns of consumption are most dangerous to the developing child. (More on Time.com: If I'm Drunk, Then You Stepped On My Toes On Purpose) Interestingly, the new study parallels the effects of alcohol on health more generally; lighter drinkers tend to do better than teetotalers while the heaviest drinkers do worse. (But see here for coverage of a study that found even heavy drinkers beat abstainers when it comes to mortality in mid- to late life.) Yet previous research in the area of maternal drinking has repeatedly found negative effects from even the lowest levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy. This data is notoriously hard to interpret, however, in part because it is based on women's self-reports: the public health message against drinking during pregnancy has been so widely adopted that women who do drink may significantly underreport their consumption to researchers. If women who say they are drinking at ""light"" levels are actually drinking at moderately or heavily, that might make the data on light drinking look more dangerous than they are. Whatever the case, American health authorities remain united in their advice that no amount of alcohol is safe for the fetus during pregnancy — and anyone who is familiar with fetal alcohol syndrome knows why. But for those women who drink before finding out they're pregnant or who have an occasional glass of wine afterward, this study can provide reassurance that very low levels of alcohol consumption during pregnancy are unlikely to cause serious problems.

"En Español By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Sept. 29, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Another study evaluating the value of mammograms for younger women finds that screening can lower the risk of dying from breast cancer for women in their 40s. The study, done in Sweden, found that women who were screened cut their risk by 29 percent. That means screening 1,250 women five times over a 10-year period would save one life, study author Hakan Jonsson said during a teleconference Wednesday. The research was published online Wednesday in the journal Cancer and is to be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology's annual Breast Cancer Symposium, which starts Friday in National Harbor, Md. The findings will no doubt do little to quell a controversy that has existed since the 1980s over the value of mammography screenings for women in their 40s. Last year, the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommended that women in their 40s not at high risk for breast cancer could forego mammograms until they turned 50 and, even then, it said they only needed to undergo screening once every two years. That recommendation met with outrage from breast cancer specialists, while other organizations, including the American Cancer Society, continued to recommend annual mammograms for women in their 40s. To further stir the pot, a Norwegian study released last week found that routine mammograms accounted for only about one-third of the decline in breast cancer death rates seen recently. The value of mammograms for women 50 and older is not in question. Speaking at the teleconference, Dr. Jennifer Obel, chair of the American Society of Clinical Oncology's communications committee, said: ""This study adds to our knowledge of mammogram performance in this age group. Many women aged 40 to 49 want unambiguous recommendations. While the optimal schedule of regular mammograms continues to be discussed by experts in the field, the critical message here is that all women starting at age 40 should talk to their doctor to understand the benefits and risks of screening and to understand what is best."" ""Mammography has been shown in study after study to reduce breast cancer deaths in women aged 40 to 49,"" Obel added. ""The real message is that any time we order a diagnostic test, we need to discuss that test with our patients. It remains the best method we have available to detect breast cancer early in the general population."" The authors of the new research, the largest epidemiological study of its kind, looked at screening and mortality data for women in Sweden. Although screening is mandated for woman aged 50 to 69 in that country, the decision to screen earlier is made by individual counties. The study authors compared death-registry data on women in their 40s who had been invited by their county to be screened with data on women who had not been invited. In all, more than 1 million women were involved in the study and the follow-up period was a lengthy 16 years. The reduction was estimated at 26 percent to 29 percent, depending on the model used, according to the study. The reduction was greater when only those women that actually attended screening were considered. The benefits were greater in women aged 45 to 49, vs. those aged 40 to 44, the researchers said. Jonsson, an associate professor of cancer epidemiology at Umea University in Sweden, could not pinpoint exactly why his findings differed from those of other studies. He mentioned certain differences in methodology as a possible factor, as well as the possibility that mammographic techniques have improved over the years. In another study released during the Wednesday press conference, researchers from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center at the University of Texas in Houston found that overall survival rates among breast cancer patients in the past six decades have increased, a trend due largely to earlier detection and treatments. ""There was a significant improvement in survival overall, including all patients with all stages of breast cancer...even those who had disseminated cancer,"" said study author Dr. Aman Buzdar, a professor of medicine and breast medical oncology at M.D. Anderson. Although the data, which covered breast cancer patients who were treated at M.D. Anderson between 1944 and 2004, came from a single institution, Buzdar said he believes the results can be generalized to other breast cancer patients.

"A three-year-old Silicon Valley start-up, Counsyl Inc., won the Bronze Innovation Award for its simple, low-cost genetic test that can alert prospective parents who might be carrying genes that could cause hereditary diseases in their children. Counsyl's technology promises a ""high quality-of-life impact for families at risk for conceiving children with familial diseases,"" says Larry Bock, an Innovation Awards judge and special limited partner at venture firm Lux Capital. ""This technology bundles previously existing capabilities but with more elegance, access and affordability."" Proponents of universal prepregnancy genetic screening make a bold claim: If these tests were widely available, they could significantly reduce, and possibly eliminate, hereditary diseases. Parents who discovered that they carried the genes that would put their children at risk for these diseases could pursue other alternatives—adoption or in vitro fertilization, for example. Widespread screening also could reduce infant mortality; 20% to 30% of infant deaths are caused by genetic illnesses. Counsyl's test requires only a saliva sample and costs about $350. Counsyl Inc. Until recently, however, most genetic tests covered only one disease at a time, required a blood sample and cost between $500 and $1,000 each. So both their use and their usefulness were extremely limited. Most prepregnancy genetic testing was performed for one of only a few diseases and only for certain ethnic groups, such as the screening for Tay-Sachs disease offered since the early 1980s to Jewish parents. Counsyl, based in Redwood City, Calif., has devised a single test that covers more than 100 genetic disorders, including Tay-Sachs, cystic fibrosis and spinal muscular atrophy. The saliva-based test costs about $350, and the cost typically is covered by most private insurance. The company uses a customized microarray—essentially a lab on a chip that can simultaneously test for lots of genetic variations at a time—and sophisticated statistical software to hunt for the presence of disease-causing mutations in genes. For the disorders it covers, the test is at least as accurate as common single-disease tests, the company says. Counsyl's lab received regulatory approval in the U.S. in the spring of 2009. The test was introduced in some clinics in May of last year and became nationally available last October. Counsyl's lab received regulatory approval in the spring of 2009.

"A No-Cringe Fix? Filling Cavities Without The Drill toggle caption Gretchen Cuda for NPR It's just past 8 a.m., and Kimberly Baker is reclining in the dental chair at Case Western Reserve University's School of Dental Medicine in Cleveland. Baker has three cavities. This morning, she'll be getting two of them drilled the old-fashioned way. But the third is a decay that is not so advanced, and Dr. Jin-Ho Phark, her dentist, is going to use a treatment he's testing that involves no drilling -- ""which is nice because many patients don't like the sound of the drill, and the feeling or the pain that might be associated with it,"" Phark says. That cringe-worthy sound may be on the way out. A new procedure used by Phark and other doctors claims to stop the progress of cavities without drills or Novocain. The treatment, called Icon, is one of several new cavity treatments that avoid drilling. Icon was developed in Germany and has been available in the U.S. for just over a year. It's intended for patients whose decay has not gone beyond the tooth enamel. To Drill Or Not To Drill Phark says that when decay is caught very early or very late, dentists have a clear course of action: Early problems can often be reversed with better brushing, fluoride or calcium-containing toothpastes -- and late-stage cavities need to be filled. But at the intermediate stages, dentists don't have many options. ""In many of those cases we decide, 'OK, this lesion is too small to be treated with a filling.' So, we are actually waiting until the lesion grows bigger and bigger and becomes deep enough and worthy to be drilled out and be filled,"" Phark says. German researcher Sebastian Paris is a dentist and one of the drill-less cavity treatment's developers. ""We aim to treat these intermediate lesions -- not the very early ones, but the intermediate ones -- where usually, as a dentist, you are not sure whether you should make a filling or not,"" Paris says. How It Works When tooth decay begins, minerals, like calcium, are leached out of the tooth enamel, leaving behind sponge-like pores in the enamel. If the decay process is allowed to continue, the pores grow and form a hole, known as a cavity. The new treatment uses a coating of mild acid that is applied to the decay to open up a route to the pores and clear out decayed enamel. Then the open pores are filled with a clear resin. toggle caption Gretchen Cuda for NPR Paris says the key to getting the treatment to work was finding a filling material that wasn't thick and goopy so the porous enamel would immediately suck it up like a sponge. ""When you take a sugar cube and you put it into your coffee, you will see that it is soaked up with the coffee,"" Paris says. ""But if you put your sugar cube into honey, you can imagine that it will take ages to soak into the sugar cube."" Cheaper, Lighter Alternatives To The Drill Avoiding the drill has the advantage of preserving and extending the life of the natural tooth. However, some dentists argue that any time before a cavity actually forms, tooth decay can be stopped -- and even reversed -- by the patients themselves, using, for example, fluoride toothpaste. ""An alternative could simply be brushing better in a certain location and not drinking Coca-Cola all day long,"" says Mark Wolff, a professor of dentistry at New York University who specializes in cariology, or the study of tooth decay. Wolff says that while the no-drill approach to treating this type of tooth decay has promise, fluoride treatments and other patient-applied methods are still more inexpensive, less invasive and have a much longer track record of success. ""Might this be a good application to help that person recover or prevent this decay from advancing? Absolutely. I think the jury is still out on the product a little bit. Hopefully it works. It's just still in its earliest stages,"" Wolff says. Because it's so new, it's still unclear how the Icon resin filling holds up over time. And clinical studies have shown that the treatment fails to stop decay from advancing up to 15 percent of the time. But Wolff says that for patients who aren't able or willing to change their dental hygiene habits, or who are predisposed to tooth decay, this may be a good solution for keeping the dentist's drill at bay.",0,story_reviews_01394
"Routine Mammograms: A Close Call So should U.S. women continue to get routine mammograms? It's a ""close call,"" says H. Gilbert Welch, MD, MPH, of the Dartmouth Institute in Lebanon, N.H. ""This is a test that women who want it should be able to have,"" Welch tells WebMD. ""But it should not be jammed down people's throats. ... The system we are working in leads doctors to coax, scare, and coerce women into having this test."" Why would a woman at normal risk of breast cancer want to get routine mammograms? The obvious answer is that these tests save lives. How many lives? If the full 10% drop in breast cancer deaths among screened women in the Norwegian study is totally due to mammograms themselves -- Welch calls this an optimistic assumption -- one life is saved for every 2,500 women who get regular mammograms. But what's the harm of routine mammograms? ""The biggest harm is you are treated for breast cancer unnecessarily, for a cancer that was never going to cause problems,"" Welch says. ""Because we don't know which cancers these are, all cancers are treated. This means some women will undergo needless surgery, radiation, or chemotherapy. On balance, this is about five to 15 of those 2,500 women screened."" Moreover, a large number of screened women will have worrisome mammogram results. ""Among the 2,500 women screened, at least 1,000 will be told something looks wrong on their mammogram, and they will have to worry that they have cancer,"" Welch says. ""The vast majority will turn out not to have cancer, but all of them will worry."" Welch notes that many women may find that the benefits of routine mammograms outweigh these risks. ""Every woman has to make her own decision about how to weigh these very dissimilar things,"" Welch says. ""Some will benefit in a very large way. But to achieve that benefit, a lot of others will have to go through something with very negative effects. It is not wrong to want a routine mammogram, and it is not wrong not to want one.""",0,story_reviews_01399

WHEN SHOULD WOMEN GET A MAMMOGRAM? Experts disagree: Age 40: The American Cancer Society says women should get annual mammograms beginning at age 40. Ages 50-74: U.S. Preventive Services Task Force says women ages 50 to 74 should get screened every other year, and women in their 40s who have a much lower risk of dying from breast cancer should decide for themselves, rather than automatically getting screened. Source: USA TODAY reporting LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM LIVING WITH CANCER FORUM For readers, by readers: Patients, survivors, loved ones touched by any type of cancer invited to share questions, advice, experiences Nearly one year after the publication of controversial breast cancer screening guidelines by a government-appointed expert panel, a new study suggests benefits of mammograms may be more modest than previously estimated. In a nationwide study in Norway, women in their 50s and 60s who got a mammogram every other year reduced their risk of dying from breast cancer by 10%, compared with those who didn't get the exams, according to a study in today's New England Journal of Medicine. That's a much smaller benefit than estimated by even the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force, which says mammograms reduce breast cancer mortality by 15% to 23%. The task force's recommendations — advising that women may not need to begin screening until age 50 — ignited a fierce debate last November, in the midst of deliberations over health care reform. In the new study, researchers tried to determine whether recent declines in breast cancer mortality were the result of mammograms or better treatments and awareness. Norway's breast screening program includes mammograms as well as innovative treatment teams to coordinate a variety of specialty care. Doctors looked at two groups of women who were similar in most ways, except that one group received mammograms and the other didn't. While deaths from breast cancer fell 28% from 1996 to 2005 among participating women, they also fell 18% for unscreened women. That suggests that mammograms can't get all the credit for the falling death rate, the study says. Instead, mammograms probably cut mortality by only 10%, the difference between the two groups, the study says. Some say the new study helps women have a more realistic understanding of what mammograms offer. For 50-year-old women, mammograms may cut the 10-year risk of dying from breast cancer from 4.4 in 1,000 to 4 in 1,000, says H. Gilbert Welch of Dartmouth Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial. Welch notes that most people are unaware of the risk of mammograms: They sometimes detect slow-growing tumors that don't pose a threat. Because doctors can't reliably tell which are life-threatening, however, they tend to treat all of them. Studies suggest that for every life saved by mammograms, five to 15 women may go through unnecessary treatment, he says. Other experts note that the study may underestimate mammogram's benefits. Researchers followed women for an average of only two years, which may not be long enough to notice a big difference in mortality, says Daniel Kopans, a spokesman for the American College of Radiology. It's also possible that some women listed in the unscreened group actually got mammograms on their own, outside of Norway's national program, which could blur the differences between the two groups. ""The authors confirm that screenings save lives,"" Kopans said in a statement. ""There is no universal cure in sight. Until one is found, annual screening and early detection, beginning by the age of 40, offer women the best chance for a cure.""

"BY THE NUMBERS BY THE NUMBERS Number of appendectomies annually in the USA: 250,000-300,000 Age group in which appendicitis is most commonly diagnosed: 10-30 Approximate overall lifetime risk of appendicitis: 7% Source: USA TODAY reporting Appendectomy is the most common emergency surgery in the world, but it doesn't have to be, suggests a study out today. Researchers analyzed data from nearly 33,000 U.S. patients who'd undergone an appendectomy. They were divided into three groups, depending on how soon they had the operation after being admitted to the hospital: within six hours, six through 12 hours and more than 12 hours. The scientists found no significant difference among the groups in the patients' condition 30 days after surgery or in the length of their operation or hospital stay. The study did have some limitations, the researchers write in the Archives of Surgery. They didn't know how much time had elapsed between when symptoms arose and when the patients arrived at the hospital. And they didn't know whether surgeons had triaged the patients, operating on the most worrisome cases first. Still, the researchers conclude, ""this information can guide the use of potentially limited operative and professional resources allocated for emergency care."" In other words, patients and health care resources might be better served if surgeons could sleep on it before starting surgery, John Hunter, a surgeon at the Oregon Health & Science University in Portland, writes in an accompanying editorial. ""The ability of a surgeon to sleep through the night results in a day without the fatigue engendered by a sleepless night caring for a patient with acute appendicitis,"" he says. ""A secondary benefit is the savings to the hospital generated by minimizing staff and anesthesiologist presence late in the evening and during the wee hours of the morning.""

"En Español By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter SUNDAY, Sept. 19, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- For asthma patients whose condition is not controlled with standard inhaled steroids, the addition of Spiriva -- a medication already approved for lung disease -- appears to improve breathing, a new study finds. However, the study authors and an outside expert stressed that these are early findings and much longer, larger clinical trials are needed. Tiotropium bromide (Spiriva)) belongs to a class of drugs called anticholinergics, which work by enlarging the airways to allow for easier breathing. Currently, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has only approved the medication for use by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a chronic ailment that is a combination of bronchitis and emphysema. Treating asthma has never been a one-size-fits-all proposition, so ""having a new class of asthma medications could be potentially important,"" said lead researcher Dr. Stephen P. Peters, a professor of pulmonary, critical care, allergy, and immunologic medicine at Wake Forest University, in Winston-Salem, NC. ""People are different. Some people will respond to some medications, some respond to others,"" he said. The report, funded by the U.S. National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, is published in the Sept. 19 online edition of the New England Journal of Medicine. The journal is releasing the data early to coincide with its presentation Sunday at the European Respiratory Society meeting in Barcelona. For the study, Peters' team tried three drug regimens on 210 asthmatics. These included: Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid; a double dose of the inhaled steroid; and an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, a long-acting beta agonist that relaxes the muscles in the airway. Patients stayed on each regiment for 14 weeks. The researchers found that Spiriva plus an inhaled steroid was more effective than giving a double dose of steroids in improving breathing and controlling asthma for these tough-to-treat patients. In addition, the combination of an inhaled steroid and Spiriva was not less effective than using an inhaled steroid plus Serevent, they said. That's important, Peters said, because there have been some safety concerns raised about long-acting beta agonists. These drugs carry a note on their labels warning of the possibility of severe adverse events, including death, he noted. The results need to be confirmed in a much larger pool of patients, Peters said, and he noted that the patients were not followed long enough to see if Spiriva was able to reduce the severity of asthma attacks and hospitalizations. In addition, Spiriva's safety profile among asthmatics still needs to be studied, he said. Because the drug is not yet FDA-approved for use in asthma, Peters was reluctant to recommend it for that use. ""My hope is that in three to five years we will have the drug approved for asthma,"" he said. Dr. Shirin Shafazand, an assistant professor of pulmonary, critical care and sleep medicine at the University of Miami Miller School of Medicine, said that ""perhaps there is a role for Spiriva in these poorly controlled asthmatics."" However, at this stage there is no definitive answer whether Spiriva should or shouldn't be used in asthma, she said. ""This is a good foundation to design a trial where you would look at Spiriva plus steroids versus doubling the dose of steroids in a large number of asthmatics who are poorly controlled and then you follow them long-term,"" Shafazand said, but right now there is no data on long-term efficacy and safety.

"A popular dietary supplement called SAMe may help depressed patients who don't respond to prescription antidepressant treatment, a new study shows. SAMe stands for S-adenosyl methionine, a naturally occurring molecule that is widely used in Europe for depression, arthritis and other ailments. It is found throughout the human body, with high concentrations in the liver, adrenal glands and brain. The latest research, conducted by investigators at Harvard Medical School and Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, is important not only because it suggests another treatment option for patients with depression, but because it also offers news clues into the physical pathways of depression that could ultimately lead to more effective treatments. ""There are many directions in research that this opens up,"" said Dr. George I. Papakostas, director of treatment resistant depression studies at Mass General and the study's lead author. ""It provides clues to new treatments, and it provides clues to understanding what causes depression as well as what goes on biochemically when people get better from depression."" The researchers studied the use of SAMe or a placebo in 73 adults with depression who were not responding to prescription antidepressant treatment. All of the study subjects continued to take the prescription antidepressant, but 39 of them were randomly assigned to receive SAMe for six weeks. The remaining 34 patients received a placebo in addition to their regular prescription treatment. After six weeks of treatment, 36 percent of the patients taking a combination of SAMe and an antidepressant showed improvement, compared to just 18 percent of those taking the antidepressant and placebo. And about 26 percent of patients in the SAMe group experienced a complete remission of symptoms, compared to just 12 percent in the placebo group, according to a report published in The American Journal of Psychiatry. The research offers hope to patients who haven't been helped by traditional antidepressant treatment. Studies suggest that for more than half of depressed patients, antidepressants alone don't eliminate symptoms. As a result, doctors are looking for additional treatments to help these patients, referred to as ""nonresponders."" Modern antidepressants essentially work by building up concentrations of neurotransmitters, which amplifies their effect on the brain. It's not clear exactly how SAMe works to curb depression, but researchers have several theories. SAMe may influence the expression of genes involved in depression or alter the function of different receptors and structures that transport neurotransmitters in the brain. The molecule also may be directly involved in the creation of neurotransmitters. ""Most antidepressants we use are acting on neurotransmitters in the brain,"" said Dr. J. Craig Nelson, professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Francisco, and author of an editorial accompanying the study. ""It may be that SAMe is facilitating the synthesis of the neurotransmitters that the drugs then act on. That's probably the best hypothesis."" Other studies have suggested that SAMe can relieve symptoms of depression. A 2002 analysis of depression trials conducted by the Agency for Health Care Research and Quality found that SAMe use resulted in clinically meaningful benefits to depressed patients compared to placebo, and that the supplement worked as well as tricyclic antidepressants, a category of prescription drugs. In his editorial, Dr. Nelson notes that SAMe is typically not covered by insurance companies, and that although the cost is relatively low, it is still more than the drug co-payments required by most health plans. A monthly supply of the same brand of supplement studied would be about $143, the editorial notes. Dr. Nelson, who was not involved in the Harvard study, said the results need to be replicated in a larger study, and that more information is needed on dosing, side effects and long-term treatment with SAMe, among other things. Dr. Papakostas agrees the study ""needs replication"" but said he is hopeful about the potential for future research. ""It's a huge advancement in terms of expanding the types of medications we have to treat depression,"" Dr. Papakostas said. ""In the last 60 years of depression research, all the treatments have focused on similar mechanisms of action. This is one of the first few studies that suggests a different mechanism. It's a medication that works differently than everything else."" The study was funded by a grant from the National Institutes of Mental Health, but the SAMe pills and placebo pills were provided by the dietary supplement maker Pharmavite. Dr. Papkostas, Dr. Nelson and other researchers involved in the study all disclosed several financial relationships with makers of prescription antidepressants.",0,story_reviews_01426
"CHICAGO (Reuters) - The common diabetes drug metformin may hold promise as a way to keep smokers from developing lung cancer, U.S. researchers said on Wednesday. They said metformin prevented lung tumor growth in mice exposed to a cancer-causing agent found in tobacco smoke, and because it is already widely used in people, it may be worth further study. Metformin has been shown to switch on an enzyme that blocks mTOR — a protein that helps tobacco-induced lung tumors grow. A team led by Dr. Philip Dennis of the National Cancer Institute, part of the National Institutes of Health, studied metformin in mice exposed to a potent, cancer-causing agent in tobacco called nicotine-derived nitrosamine ketone or NNK. They treated the mice with metformin either orally or with an injection. Mice that got the drug orally had 40 to 50 percent fewer tumors, while those injected with the drug had 72 percent fewer tumors. The findings were so strong the team now wants to test it in smokers to see if it can keep then from developing tumors. ""Although smoking cessation is the most important step for current smokers, over half of lung cancer cases are diagnosed in former smokers, raising the importance of identifying those at highest risk and identifying effective preventive treatments,"" Dennis, whose findings were published in the journal Cancer Prevention Research, said in a statement. Other studies have shown that metformin can cut diabetics' risk of pancreatic and breast cancers, and the latest finding now suggests it may defend the body against smoking-induced lung tumors. ""This important laboratory study, together with prior laboratory and epidemiology research, suggests that metformin may be useful in cancer prevention and treatment,"" said Dr. Michael Pollak of McGill University in Montreal, who wrote a review on metformin research in the same journal. The World Health Organization says tobacco is the leading preventable cause of death globally, killing more than 5 million people each year from heart disease, cancer and lung disease. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that 20 percent of U.S. adults smoke. Tobacco kills one-third to one-half of those who smoke.",0,story_reviews_01433
"A small study of an experimental drug for advanced melanoma — a brutal disease that often kills within nine months — is giving rare hope to doctors and patients. For the first time, doctors say, new therapies that include the drug allow them to envision a time when they might be able to keep melanoma patients alive for years, treating the tumor as they would a chronic disease. Q&A: Learn more about this promising new drug The pill, known as PLX4032, doesn't cure melanoma, and it helps only the roughly 50% of melanoma patients whose tumors have a mutation in a key gene called BRAF. But among those patients in the study, 81% saw their tumors shrink. And for those 32 patients, the drug kept melanoma in check for a median of seven months, says the study's lead author, Keith Flaherty of Massachusetts General Hospital. No other drug has ever helped that high a percentage of patients with melanoma or any other solid tumor, says Paul Chapman, co-author of the study in today's New England Journal of Medicine. The results are especially striking, he says, considering that only 10% to 20% of patients respond to standard treatments for melanoma, which don't improve overall survival. ""This is the most important breakthrough in melanoma, ever,"" says Lynn Schuchter of the University of Pennsylvania, who worked on the study. Some patients improved within days, she says. The most common side effects are fatigue, rash and joint pain, but some patients also developed non-lethal skin cancers, the study says. Until recently, patients have had few treatment options. The last new treatment for advanced melanoma was approved 12 years ago, says Timothy Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation. In June, however, researchers published results of another experimental drug, ipilimumab, the first to prolong overall survival for advanced melanoma patients in a large-scale trial. And researchers already are developing several other drugs similar to PLX4032, Turnham says, which could be key to preventing relapses. Although cancer often can mutate to get around one roadblock, the disease might have a harder time overcoming two, three or four different obstacles. One day, Flaherty says, doctors hope to routinely test patients' tumors for their genetic makeup, then prescribe a drug combination to keep melanoma under control for years. For now, the new drug ""gives us something that we've never had before, which is to reverse the disease for a period of time and give people a respite,"" he says. ""But our goals are much loftier than that. We're not just aiming to buy patients nine months. We hope this marks the beginning of an era.""

"En Español By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Aug. 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- By probing deeper into the biological mechanisms that go awry in melanoma, scientists have come up with an experimental drug that has had an effect in a surprising number of patients with advanced melanoma. The drug, PLX4032, just completed a phase 1 clinical trial in which 81 percent of participants with a particular gene mutation had a partial response, meaning at least some shrinkage of the tumor. The current standard treatments for metastatic melanoma -- chemotherapy and interleukin-2 (IL2) -- only have response rates in about 15 percent of these patients, said Dr. Paul Chapman, senior author of a study in which the findings are described. The average survival time for someone diagnosed with melanoma is nine to 11 months, added Chapman, who is an attending physician in the Melanoma Sarcoma Service at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York City. One expert cautioned that it's too early to say whether the drug will actually prolong patient's lives, or if it might be helpful to patients in earlier stages of the disease. ""I don't want to say this is going to change survival rates but they're working with the most ill people, so you can't really generalize [to other patient populations],"" said Dr. Alice Pentland, chair of dermatology at the University of Rochester Medical Center. ""I think the most important part of this breakthrough is the bigger percentage of people who responded."" The study, which is published in the Aug. 26 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine, was funded by drug makers Plexxikon and Roche Pharmaceuticals. About nine years ago, scientists discovered that the tumors of about half of patients with melanoma have a mutation in a gene called BRAF. The gene appears to help drive the runaway cell division that is a hallmark of cancer. ""It's always on. It's always signaling to the nucleus [of the tumor cells] that it's time to divide,"" Chapman explained. That finding opened the door to potential targeted, molecular therapies for melanoma, which has been sorely lacking in effective treatments. PLX4032 is the first potent inhibitor of BRAF that has made it to the clinical trial stage, Chapman said. In the trial, 55 patients received escalating doses of the drug. Ten of 16 patients who had the BRAF gene mutation had a partial response to the drug, meaning the tumor shrank by at least 30 percent, while one had a complete response, with the tumor disappearing altogether. Among 32 patients with BRAF-mutated melanoma in the second phase of the study, 24 had a partial response and two had a complete response. ""It worked: 81 percent had a partial response -- which has never been seen. I don't know of any solid tumors that have a response rate that high,"" said Chapman. ""What's different here is that we've discovered a molecule that is responsible for driving the melanoma cell. It turns out that the melanoma really cares if we block the gene BRAF. It matters. It's addicted to this pathway."" There are some important caveats, however. It's not known at this time if the drug can improve overall survival, and a sizable proportion of participants developed resistance to the drug, the researchers say. The findings join other recent reports of potential treatments for melanoma in what appears to be an exciting time for the field. Progress in this field has essentially been stalled for decades, experts say. Recently, scientists reported that another experimental drug, ipilimumab, prolonged median survival in patients with metastatic melanoma from 6.4 months to 10 months. ""[Existing therapy] is not good for melanoma, so this is really a new opportunity that I think may have some importance to people,"" Pentland said. However, she stressed that the best defense against melanoma is to get your skin examined regularly by a professional who knows what to look for. ""Our most successful treatment is to get [the lesion] early, get it before it's thick, get it before it spreads,"" she said.

"Doctors and patients ""traditionally see palliative care as something extended to a hospitalized patient in the last week of life,"" said Dr. Jennifer S. Temel, an oncologist and author of the paper. ""We thought it made sense to start them at the time of diagnosis. And we were thrilled to see such a huge impact. It shows that palliative care and cancer care aren't mutually exclusive."" Dr. Atul Gawande, a Harvard Medical School surgeon and writer who just published a long article in The New Yorker about hospitalized patients' suffering before death, called the study ""amazing."" ""The field was crying out for a randomized trial,"" he added. Although the study could not determine why the patients lived longer, the authors and other experts had several theories: depression is known to shorten life, and patients whose pain is treated often sleep better, eat better and talk more with relatives. Also, hospitals are dangerous places for very sick people; they may get fatal blood infections, pneumonia or bedsores, or simply be overwhelmed by the powerful drugs and radiation attacking their cancer. Saying the study was ""of critical importance,"" Dr. R. Sean Morrison, president of the American Academy of Hospice and Palliative Medicine, said it was the ""first concrete evidence of what a lot of us have seen in our practices — when you control pain and other symptoms, people not only feel better, they live longer."" There is sometimes tension between medical specialties, since surgeons and oncologists often view cancer as a battle, while palliative care specialists are seen as ""giving up.""

It includes the options any oncologist addresses: surgery, chemotherapy and radiation and their side effects. But it also includes how much suffering a patient wishes to bear, effects on the family, and legal, insurance and religious issues. Teams focus on controlling pain, nausea, swelling, shortness of breath and other side effects; they also address patients' worries and make sure they have help with making meals, dressing and bathing when not hospitalized. Hospice care is intensive palliative care including home nursing, but insurers and Medicare usually cover it only if the patient abandons medical treatment and two doctors certify that death is less than six months away. During the debate over President Obama's 2009 health care bill, provisions to have Medicare and insurers pay for optional consultations with doctors on palliative and hospice care led to rumors, spread by talk-show hosts like Rush Limbaugh and Glenn Beck and by the former vice-presidential candidate Sarah Palin, that the bill empowered ""death panels"" that would ""euthanize"" elderly Americans. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Legislators eventually removed the provisions. In practice, Medicare and private insurers do pay for some palliative care, said Dr. Gail Austin Cooney, a former president of the palliative medicine academy. ""But it's piecemeal,"" she said. ""The billing is complicated, and for many physicians that's enough of a deterrent to not bother."" Dr. Cooney herself had such care along with surgery and chemotherapy for ovarian cancer in 2008. ""I decided I wanted every drop of chemotherapy they could give me, and it was very painful, dumping the drugs directly into my belly,"" she said. She needed powerful painkillers, and also chose alternative-medicine options like acupuncture and ""energy work"" for nausea and fatigue. ""I'm rigid — I had my last chemo treatment on Christmas Eve because I wanted it on the day I was due for it,"" she said. ""But I couldn't have completed the program without the psychosocial support."" Palliative care experts now want to study patients with other cancers, heart disease, stroke, dementia and emphysema. But the National Institutes of Health is under budget pressure, and the other major source of money for medical research, the pharmaceutical industry, has little incentive to study palliative care. This trial was paid for by the American Society of Clinical Oncology and private philanthropy. ""Philanthropists tend to focus on curing cancer,"" Dr. Temel said. ""But we can't ignore people who need end-of-life care.""",0,story_reviews_01455
"En Español By Jenifer Goodwin HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Aug. 18, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Fibromyalgia sufferers may find relief from the chronic pain condition by doing tai chi, new research finds. Researchers divided 66 people with fibromyalgia into two groups: one group did hour-long sessions of tai chi twice a week for 12 weeks; the other had a twice-weekly wellness education class followed by gentle stretching. At the end of 12 weeks, the tai chi group reported improvements in their scores on questionnaires regarding both physical and mental fibromyalgia symptoms. That included decreased pain and increased ability to do daily tasks without pain; less fatigue, depression and anxiety; and an overall better quality of life. Patients also reported better sleep quality and improved physical conditioning. The improvements were still evident at 24 weeks, according to the research reported in the Aug. 19 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine. ""It was incredible,"" said lead study author Dr. Chenchen Wang, an associate professor of medicine in the rheumatology department at Tufts Medical Center in Boston. ""You could see them change every week. They became very happy. I felt very, very excited to be with them."" Fibromyalgia is characterized by widespread pain, fatigue, insomnia and multiple tender points. The syndrome can also cause psychological issues, including anxiety, depression, and memory and concentration problems, sometimes called the ""fibromyalgia fog."" About 10 million Americans have fibromyalgia, and about 75 percent to 90 percent of them are women, according to estimates from the National Fibromyalgia Association. Doctors will often suggest exercise, sleep hygiene techniques and medications to treat the condition, but often with limited success, said Dr. Gloria Yeh, an assistant professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School, who wrote an accompanying editorial in the journal. Most patients, according to background information in the article, remain in pain years after the diagnosis, are aerobically unfit, have poor muscle strength and flexibility, and need medications to control symptoms. While larger studies are needed to confirm the findings, tai chi looks promising as an alternative treatment, Yeh said. ""This could represent an ideal exercise for fibromyalgia sufferers. Since it is a low-impact, gentle, non-threatening, accessible activity, it may be a perfect exercise for debilitated patients with fibromyalgia who otherwise cannot or choose not to do other forms of exercise,"" Yeh said. ""Also, since tai chi has a meditative component, it may also help to address the stress and anxiety that may be associated with the condition."" So what is it about tai chi that works? There's no definitive answer to that just yet, Wang said. Tai chi is a mind-body exercise that originated as a martial art in China, utilizing slow, gentle movements to build strength and flexibility, as well as deep breathing and relaxation, to move qi, or vital energy, throughout the body. Prior research has shown exercise can improve mood, Wang added. The controlled breathing and movements may promote ""mental tranquility,"" according to the study, which could help with pain. ""The physical component of tai chi can improve aerobic capacity, strength and muscle function,"" Wang said. ""But in my opinion, the most important part is mental. You see lots of patients improve their depression and become good friends with each other."" The National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine of the U.S. National Institutes of Health provided funding for the research.

"Obesity Surgery Helps Diabetic Patients Kick Medicines Most people turning to surgery for weight loss are probably concerned with how many pounds they can expect to shed. But an analysis of insurance claims for more than 2,200 people with Type 2 diabetes who underwent stomach-reducing surgery found that the vast majority of them were able to drop drugs they had been taking to treat the condition beforehand. A year after surgery more than 80 percent of patients were no longer taking any of the diabetes medicines they had been on before the operations. The most common drugs before treatment were metformin, a generic taken by about half of patients, followed by the medicines Avandia and Actos, taken by more than one-third of patients. The Johns Hopkins researchers also calculated the effects of surgery on health costs for the patients. After a $616 increase in expenses during the first year following surgery, the costs declined by $2,179 in the second year and $4,497 in year three. The costs were compared with the median annual health costs before surgery -- $6,367. The researchers argue that the findings, drawn from data on four years of claims made in seven states, support coverage of bariatric surgery by insurers because of the savings and improvements in patients' health. The ultimate savings case requires some extrapolation, though. The cost of the surgery was about $30,000, which exceeds the savings observed directly. Also, at two years after surgery, data were available for less than half the patients. By year three, the data were only available for 288 patients, about 13 percent of those who got the surgery. Finally, surgery isn't without risk. While mortality in the hospital was 0.3 percent, some 21 percent of patients had to be admitted to the hospital again for one reason or another within a year of their operations. The findings appear in the latest Archives of Surgery.",0,story_reviews_01460
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Fast food outlets should hand out free cholesterol-lowering statin drugs to their customers to ""neutralize"" the heart risks of eating fatty foods like burgers and fries, British scientists suggested on Thursday. The quadruple bypass cheese burger is displayed at Heart Attack Grill in Chandler, Arizona June 17, 2009. REUTERS/Joshua Lott But a few experts say you might want to ask your server to hold the statin at this point. In a study published in the American Journal of Cardiology, scientists from the National Heart and Lung Institute at Imperial College London calculated that the reduction in heart disease risk offered by a statin could offset the increase in risk from eating a cheeseburger and a milkshake. ""Statins don't cut out all of the unhealthy effects of a burger and fries. It's better to avoid fatty food altogether. But we've worked out that in terms of your likelihood of having a heart attack, taking a statin can reduce your risk to more or less the same degree as a fast food meal increases it,"" said Dr. Darrel Francis, who led the research team. ""When people engage in risky behaviors like driving or smoking, they're encouraged to take measures that minimize their risk, like wearing a seatbelt or choosing cigarettes with filters. Taking a statin is a rational way of lowering some of the risks of eating a fatty meal."" Still, Peter Weissberg, medical director at the British Heart Foundation (BHF) health charity, said Francis' idea should not be taken too literally. He urged people to focus on maintaining a good diet and taking exercise to keep their hearts healthy. ""Statins are a vital medicine for people with — or at high risk of developing — heart disease,"" he said. ""They are not a magic bullet."" A study in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine suggested, in fact, that statins do not save lives in patients without heart disease, although they may prevent some non-fatal heart attacks. Dr. Franz Messerli, the director of the hypertension program at two New York hospitals, St. Luke's and Roosevelt, worried about the message handing out statins would send to burger-eaters. ""Complimentary statin packets are prone to ... give Quarter Pounder consumers a sense of false security,"" he told Reuters Health by email. While statins might combat some of the toll that fatty foods take on cholesterol, there's a lot they can't negate: ""sodium content is high, fibres are absent, and caloric load gargantuan,"" Messerli said of the fast food the authors looked at. Statins are among the most widely used drugs for the treatment and prevention of heart disease and strokes — the world's top killers. One statin, a generic drug called simvastatin, is already available in low doses over the counter at pharmacies in Britain without a prescription. Other statins such as Pfizer's Lipitor and AstraZeneca's Crestor - which are among the biggest-selling drugs in the world — are for prescription only. In the U.S., all statins are only available by prescription. ""Although no substitute for systematic lifestyle improvements, including healthy diet, regular exercise, weight loss, and smoking cessation, complimentary statin packets would add, at little cost, one positive choice to a panoply of negative ones,"" the scientists write in their paper. Francis' team — who worked independently and had no funding from the drug or food industries for their research — used data from a previous large study to quantify how a person's heart attack risk increases with their daily intake of total fat and harmful trans fats. They compared this with the decrease in risk from taking statins, using data from seven previously published trials. ""It makes sense to make risk-reducing supplements available just as easily as the unhealthy condiments (such as salt or ketchup) that are provided free of charge,"" Francis said in his report of the research. ""It would cost less than 5 pence ($0.07) per customer — not much different to a sachet of ketchup.""

"LONDON (Reuters) - A 15-minute brain scan could in future be used to test for autism, helping doctors diagnose the complex condition more cheaply and accurately. British scientists said on Tuesday their rapid test had proved more than 90 percent accurate in adults and there was no reason why it should not work equally well in children. It could be a boon for patients and their doctors by reducing reliance on time-consuming and emotionally trying assessments based on interviews and behavioral observation. Autism is a complex brain disorder characterized by difficulties in social interaction and communication, ranging from mild to profound impairment. The new scanning method — which picks up on structural changes in the brain's grey matter — could be ready for general use in a couple of years. The next goal is to test it in children. ""What we are working on now is to see if we find the same results in younger people,"" research leader Declan Murphy, professor of psychiatry at the Institute of Psychiatry, King's College London, said in an interview. ""We would hope that it would work just as well ... there is no reason why not."" TREATMENT The ability to base a diagnosis on an objective biological test, rather than having to rely on personality traits, should mean patients get treatment more quickly, he added. Cognitive behavioral therapy and educational treatment can be highly effective for some patients and the impact of a more certain prognosis would be especially beneficial for children. Murphy and colleagues, who published their findings in the Journal of Neuroscience, studied 20 healthy adults and another 20 individuals previously diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder, which also includes Asperger syndrome. The accuracy of the scan in predicting autism was so high that the results were strongly significant, despite the small number of patients involved. Experts not involved in the research applauded the research but cautioned further study was still needed. ""Although this method is not ready for normal diagnostic situations, any step to easier diagnosis is welcome,"" said Terry Brugha, professor of psychiatry at the University of Leicester. Murphy said he envisaged that in future autism specialists would use a scan alongside interviews, in much the same way as doctors monitoring diabetes look at blood test results alongside patient histories. The new system works by analyzing variations in the shape and structure of brain regions linked to language and social behavior, using standard magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) machines made by companies like General Electric, Siemens and Philips. The speed of the test makes it some 20 times cheaper than traditional tests, which can take a team of doctors four to eight hours to conduct. The actual brain scan costs around 100 pounds ($157.5). Autism spectrum disorders are diagnosed in one percent of the population in Britain and the United States, and the condition affects four times as many boys as girls. Researchers agree there is a strong genetic component.",0,story_reviews_01469

About 24 million Americans take the drugs — marketed under such commercial names as Pravachol, Mevacor, Lipitor, Zocor and Crestor — largely to stave off heart attacks and strokes. An article in Monday's Health section on the effectiveness of statins said that the drugs appeared on the American pharmaceutical landscape in the late 1990s. The first statin, lovastatin, was approved by the Food and Drug Administration for marketing in 1987 and appeared on the U.S. market the same year.At the zenith of their profitability, these medications raked in $26.2 billion a year for their manufacturers. The introduction in recent years of cheaper generic versions may have begun to cut into sales revenues for the brand-name drugs that came first to the market, but better prices have only fueled the medications' use: In 2009, U.S. patients filled 201.4 million prescriptions for statins, according to IMS Health, which tracks prescription drug trends. That's nearly double the number of prescriptions written for statins in 2001, four years after they arrived on the American pharmaceutical landscape.But in recent months the drugs' touted medical reputation has come under tough scrutiny.Statins were initially approved by the Food and Drug Administration for the prevention of repeat heart attacks and strokes in patients with high cholesterol who had already had a heart attack. And used for that purpose — called ""secondary prevention"" — the drugs are powerful and effective medications, driving down patients' risk of another heart attack or stroke by lowering their levels of LDL (or ""bad"") cholesterol.Then physicians came to believe statins could also reduce the risk of a first heart attack in people who have high LDL cholesterol but are nonetheless healthy. This use of statins — called ""primary prevention"" — has driven the growth in the market for statins over the last decade.Today, a majority of people who use statins are doing so for primary prevention of heart attacks and strokes. It is this use of statins that has come under recent attack.""There's a conspiracy of false hope,"" says Harvard Medical School's Dr. John Abramson, who has cowritten several critiques of statins' rise, including one published in June in the Archives of Internal Medicine. ""The public wants an easy way to prevent heart disease, doctors want to reduce their patients' risk of heart disease and drug companies want to maximize the number of people taking their pills to boost their sales and profits.""Heart patients and their physicians are not the only ones to pin their hopes on statins. The drug companies that brought statins to the market have explored the medications' benefits in prevention or treatment of such conditions as Alzheimer's disease, rheumatoid arthritis, prostate and breast cancer, kidney disease, macular degeneration and diabetic neuropathy. Although clear proof that statins could forestall or treat any of these diseases might bring in millions of new, paying customers, results have largely been mixed, inconclusive or disappointing.In an ideal world, debate over the clinical virtues or vices of a drug would be long settled by the time the medication saw a meteoric rise in use. But in a healthcare system that relies on commercial incentives to spur drug development, prescription medications are a product like any other.The FDA assesses drugs' safety and effectiveness for specific use; but its judgments are based on preliminary data, most of it generated by a drug company seeking approval for its product. Once the agency approves a drug for marketing, the company that makes it will move quickly and aggressively to expand the universe of patients taking its product.Sometimes, by the time the deliberate pace of medical research and debate suggests that a drug is not all it's been cracked up to be, it's already become a bestseller. Statins, say some who study the relationship between medicine and the drug industry, seem to fit that pattern.Statins appear to drive down the risk of heart attack or stroke by lowering the levels of fatty deposits circulating in the bloodstream. Research suggests that the drugs dampen inflammatory processes that can prompt deposits of plaque to break away from blood vessel walls and cause sudden blockages of arteries leading to the heart or brain.And yet, the relationship between cholesterol-lowering and heart disease is not perfectly understood, and the precise role of inflammation in heart disease is also uncertain.Statins certainly decrease rates of heart attack in people who have clear signs of cardiovascular disease, but it's not so clear they work that way in people who are healthy. In spite of that uncertainty, statins' use for primary prevention has skyrocketed.That's the issue in the latest round of debate, which spilled onto the pages of the Archives of Internal Medicine in late June: whether statins prevent, safely and at a reasonable cost, the development of cardiovascular disease in people who are still healthy but are considered to be at high risk of a heart attack or stroke.In the first of three studies published in the Archives last month, medical researchers found that, contrary to widely held belief, statins do not drive down death rates among those who take them to prevent a first heart attack. A second article cast significant doubt on the influential findings of a 2006 study, called JUPITER, that has driven the expansion of statins' use by healthy people with elevated blood levels of C-reactive protein, a measure of inflammation. A third article suggested potential ethical, clinical and financial conflicts of interest at work in the execution of the JUPITER study and concluded the widely hailed trial was ""flawed"" and raises ""troubling questions concerning the role of commercial sponsors.""""Tens of billions of dollars of revenue for the sponsor over the patent life of the drug were at stake in the JUPITER trial, as well as potentially millions of dollars in royalties for the principal investigator,"" wrote Dr. Lee Green of the University of Michigan Medical School in an editorial accompanying the trio of studies. ""Doubtless, both sponsor and investigative team believe they made their design decisions for the right reasons,"" Green added. ""But social psychology research provides abundant evidence that we human beings both respond strongly to self-interest incentives and firmly believe that we do not.""Statins still have ardent admirers, including cardiologist Steven Nissen of the Cleveland Clinic in Ohio. For many patients on a clear collision course with heart disease but not there yet, he said, statins make a difference. And even though recent studies question whether statins reduce heart attack deaths, Nissen added, many patients' lives are clearly improved by pushing a heart attack further into the future.The stakes of this debate are big and continuing to grow (see related story, "" Pinning down the side effects of statins ""). As many as three-quarters of patients currently taking statins haven't yet had a stroke or heart attack; they have diabetes or high LDL cholesterol, conditions widely thought to put them at high risk of having one.Those patients largely joined the ranks of statin consumers after 2001, when the National Heart, Blood and Lung Institute adopted guidelines on the treatment of patients with high cholesterol. The guidelines, updated again in 2004, suggested that as many as 36 million Americans should take statins — essentially tripling overnight the potential American market for the drugs. Of the nine experts involved in drafting the cholesterol treatment guidelines, the National Institutes of Health later acknowledged that eight had substantial financial ties to statin makers — links that may have predisposed them to view evidence of statins' benefit in its most positive light.Said Abramson, the author of ""Overdosed America: The Broken Promise of American Medicine"": The best way to drive down the risk of developing cardiovascular disease in the first place is to exercise regularly, not smoke, drink in moderation and eat a healthy Mediterranean-style diet. But, he added, ""this message gets drowned out by the commercial interests"" of pharmaceutical companies who stand to benefit from increased sales.",0,story_reviews_01472
"The drug MDMA—better known by its street name, Ecstasy—may be illegal, but a new study suggests that it's also a promising treatment for post-traumatic stress disorder. The study, which appears in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, included 20 people with PTSD stemming from traumas such as sexual assault and combat stress. On two separate occasions, 12 of the people took a dose of MDMA and then spoke for several hours with a pair of trained therapists. The others took a placebo but received the same therapy. (All of the participants received additional therapy sessions that did not involve the drug.) Two months later, 10 of the 12 people who took MDMA had improved to the point where they no longer met the diagnostic criteria for PTSD, and three participants whose condition had prevented them from holding down a job were able to return to work. By contrast, just two of the eight people in the placebo group experienced a substantial improvement in their symptoms. MDMA is believed to raise levels of the feel-good brain chemical serotonin and the so-called ""bonding hormone,"" oxytocin. The resulting sense of euphoria and emotional warmth seems to help patients connect with their therapists, says Michael Mithoefer, M.D., the lead author of the study and a Mount Pleasant, South Carolina-based psychiatrist who specializes in PTSD. ""A lot of the time, people have quite painful and challenging experiences revisiting the trauma, and [MDMA] can help them do it without being overwhelmed or numbed out,"" he says. Don't try this experiment at home. Ecstasy use can cause depression, severe anxiety, and potential cognitive problems, according to the National Institute on Drug Abuse. And when purchased on the street it can be contaminated. Conducting a study with an illegal drug is a complex process. This was the first clinical trial to explore the therapeutic potential of MDMA since the drug was outlawed in 1985, and the researchers required the permission of the National Institutes of Health, the Food and Drug Administration , and the Drug Enforcement Administration. ""It took quite a bit of time to get approval,"" Mithoefer says. The study was funded by the Multidisciplinary Association for Psychedelic Studies, a California-based nonprofit organization that also sponsors research on medical marijuana and psychedelic drugs such as LSD and psilocybin. The use of MDMA in psychotherapy has been studied for decades, but research in the U.S. all but ground to a halt after the drug became illegal. Mithoefer and his team are now gearing up for a similar study involving combat veterans, which is scheduled to begin later this year.",0,story_reviews_01495
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Older adults who get plenty of vitamin E in their diets may have a somewhat lower risk of developing dementia than those who consume less of the nutrient, a study published Monday suggests. Researchers found that among 5,400 Dutch adults age 55 and older, the one-third who reported the highest vitamin E intake from food were 25 percent less likely to develop dementia, including Alzheimer's disease, over the next decade than the third with the lowest intakes. The findings, reported in the Archives of Neurology, do not prove that vitamin E itself protects the aging brain. Studies so far have come to conflicting conclusions as to whether vitamin E or other antioxidants may influence older adults' risk of dementia. However, the new study followed participants for a longer period than most previous studies on antioxidants and dementia. And it supports findings from some previous research that dietary vitamin E, in particular, might be related to a lower risk of dementia. Researchers have been interested in whether antioxidants like vitamins E and C and beta-carotene might help stave off dementia because, in theory, their actions might interfere with the process of brain-cell degeneration. Antioxidants neutralize unstable forms of oxygen called reactive oxygen species that can damage cells throughout the body. Reactive oxygen species are produced naturally in the body, as byproducts of metabolism; because the brain is an area of high metabolic activity, it is thought to be particularly vulnerable to accumulating oxidative damage over a lifetime. However, studies so far have come to mixed conclusions as to whether older adults with a high dietary intake of various antioxidants have a lower risk of dementia. And clinical trials looking at the effects of antioxidant supplements have found no evidence that they cut Alzheimer's risk. For the new study, researchers led by Dr. Monique Breteler, of Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, used data from 5,395 adults age 55 and older who were dementia-free at the start of the study. At that point, they were interviewed about their usual diet habits, which the researchers used to estimate their intake of vitamins C and E and beta-carotene. Over the next decade, 465 study participants were diagnosed with dementia, including 365 with Alzheimer's. Among the one-third of men and women with the highest vitamin E intakes from food, 120 developed dementia. Of the third with the lowest intakes, 164 were diagnosed with dementia. When Breteler's team considered a number of other factors — including participants' age, education, weight, and smoking and drinking habits — high vitamin E intake was linked to a one-quarter reduction in dementia risk. The one-third of study participants with the highest vitamin E consumption typically got 18.5 milligrams (mg) per day, just over the recommended daily intake of 15 mg. The researchers acknowledge that they cannot exclude the possibility that factors other than vitamin E explain the connection. Nor is it clear why vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was linked to a lower dementia risk. But the finding is in line with a previous study of U.S. adults that found that a higher intake of vitamin E, but not vitamin C or beta-carotene, was related to a lower risk of developing Alzheimer's over two years. According to Breteler's team, studies should continue to look at the relationship between antioxidant intake and dementia — including whether antioxidant consumption at different points in life might have different effects on dementia risk. Food sources of vitamin E include wheat germ, nuts such as almonds and hazelnuts, vegetable oils such as sunflower and safflower oils, and some green vegetables, such as spinach and broccoli. In the current study, participants' primary vitamin E sources included vegetable oils, margarine and butter. It is unlikely that people could get too much vitamin E from food. However, high doses of vitamin E from supplements carry a risk of bleeding. Experts advise that adults consume no more than 1,000 mg of vitamin E per day.

"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A form of ‘mind-body' therapy that focuses on the role of emotions in physical pain may offer some relief to people with fibromyalgia, a small clinical trial suggests. The study, of 45 women with fibromyalgia, found that those who learned a technique called ""affective self-awareness"" were more likely to show a significant reduction in their pain over six months. Overall, 46 percent of the women had a 30-percent or greater reduction in their pain severity, as measured by a standard pain-rating scale. In contrast, of study participants who were assigned to a wait-list for therapy, none showed a similar decline in pain. Fibromyalgia is a syndrome marked by widespread pain — including discomfort at specific ""tender points"" in the body — along with symptoms such as fatigue, irritable bowel and sleep problems. It is estimated to affect up to 5 million U.S. adults, most commonly middle-aged women. The precise cause of fibromyalgia is unknown — there are no physical signs, such as inflammation and tissue damage in the painful area — but some researchers believe the disorder involves problems in how the brain processes pain signals. Standard treatments include painkillers, antidepressants, cognitive- behavioral therapy and exercise therapy. However, many people with fibromyalgia find that their symptoms — pain, in particular — persist despite treatment. Part of that, according to the researchers on the new study, may be because standard treatments do not specifically address the role psychological stress and emotions can play in triggering people's pain. That is not to say that the pain people with fibromyalgia feel is ""all in their head,"" stressed Dr. Howard Schubiner, of St. John Health/ Providence Hospital and Medical Centers in Southfield, Michigan. ""The pain is very real,"" Schubiner said in an interview. But, he explained, pain and emotions are ""connected in the brain,"" and emotional factors may act to trigger ""learned nerve pathways"" that give rise to pain. Past studies have found that compared with people without fibromyalgia, those with the disorder have higher rates of stressful life events, such as childhood abuse, marital problems and high levels of job stress. There is also evidence that they are relatively less aware of their own emotions and more reluctant to express their feelings, particularly anger. For the new study, published in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, Schubiner and his colleagues tested the effects of affective self-awareness — a technique Schubiner developed and uses in treating certain chronic-pain conditions — on fibromyalgia. They randomly assigned 45 women with the condition to either undergo the therapy or go on a wait-list for treatment, serving as a control group. Women in the treatment group each had a one-on-one consultation, then attended three group meetings to learn the affective self-awareness techniques so that they could carry them out on their own. The therapy involves an educational component where patients learn about the emotion-pain connection. They learn specific techniques — including mindfulness meditation and ""expressive"" writing — for recognizing and dealing with the emotions that may be contributing to their pain. Patients are also encouraged to get back to any exercise or other activities that they have been avoiding due to pain. Schubiner's team found that six months later, 46 percent of the treatment group had at least a 30-percent reduction in their pain ratings compared with scores at the outset. And 21 percent had a 50-percent or greater reduction. None of the women in the control group had a comparable improvement. The study is only the first clinical trial to test affective self-awareness for fibromyalgia, and it had a number of limitations, including its small size. In addition, the control group received no active therapy to serve as a comparison. That is important because it is possible for patients to benefit from simply receiving attention from a healthcare provider, or being part of small-group sessions with other people suffering from the same condition, for example. Schubiner also acknowledged that this general ""model"" for understanding and addressing fibromyalgia pain is controversial. He said that he and his colleagues have applied for funding to conduct a larger clinical trial comparing affective self-awareness with standard cognitive-behavioral therapy. Affective self-awareness and cognitive-behavioral therapy have similarities, according to Schubiner. Both, for example, try to show patients that they have the power to improve their own health. A key difference, Schubiner said, is that affective self-awareness asks people to ""directly engage"" the emotions that may be helping to drive their symptoms. Another difference is that, right now, only a small number of healthcare providers practice affective self-awareness, according to Schubiner. Some components of the technique, such as teachings in mindfulness meditation, are more widely available. But whether those practices in isolation would help fibromyalgia patients' pain is not clear.

"En Español By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, June 30, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Adding to the ongoing debate on the usefulness of the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) blood test for prostate cancer, new research from Sweden finds the screen cuts lives lost to the disease by almost half. The argument over whether PSA screening saves men's lives or merely leads to the overdiagnosis of very slow-growing cancers (with attendant worry and overtreatment) has bedeviled the medical world for years. According to recently revised guidelines from the American Cancer Society, men at average risk for prostate cancer should discuss the PSA test with their doctor, starting at age 50. For men at high risk for the disease -- blacks and men who have a father, brother or son found to have prostate cancer at an early age (before 65) -- that discussion should start at age 45. ""Because prostate cancer grows slowly, those men without symptoms of prostate cancer who do not have a 10-year life expectancy should not be offered testing since they are not likely to benefit,"" the society notes on its Web site. Ambivalence over the test hasn't been confined to the United States. ""In Europe, we have been reluctant to recommend that all men get PSA testing as we have felt that there has been a lack of knowledge,"" agreed lead researcher Dr. Jonas Hugosson, a professor of urology at the University of Gothenburg. However, he believes that with the results of the new 14-year study, ""it feels ethically difficult not at least to inform all men over the age of 50 about PSA and its possibilities. Personally, I would recommend my friends check their PSA,"" Hugosson added. The report is published in the June 30 online edition of The Lancet Oncology. For the still-ongoing study, Hugosson randomly assigned some 20,000 men to either PSA screening once every two years or no screening. The men were between 50 and 65 at the start of the study. Men whose PSA levels were above normal were offered more tests, such as a digital rectal exam and prostate biopsies. Over 14 years of follow-up, deaths from prostate cancer dropped by 44 percent among the screened men, compared with unscreened men, the researchers found. Overall, 44 of the men who had PSA testing died from prostate cancer, compared to 78 men who had not had been screened. Among screened men, 11.4 percent were diagnosed with prostate cancer, compared with 7.2 percent of unscreened men. Of the men in the screened group diagnosed with prostate cancer, nearly 79 percent were diagnosed because they took part in the study, the researchers noted. In addition, men in the screened group were more likely to have their cancer diagnosed while it was in an early stage. In the screened group, 46 men were diagnosed with advanced cancer, compared with 87 men in the unscreened group, Hugosson's team found. ""Our study has a longer follow-up than previous studies, but shows that in those men invited [to the study], the risk of dying is only half of that in the control group. In men younger than 60 at study entry, the effect was even more pronounced -- only one-quarter of expected deaths occurred,"" Hugosson said. Moreover, the risk of over-diagnosis was less than previously thought, with just 12 men needed to be diagnosed to save one life. However, since the benefit of PSA screening requires at least 10 years to be borne out, it still seems questionable to test PSA for men over 70, the researchers noted. Dr. David E. Neal, a professor of surgical oncology at the University of Cambridge in the U.K. and author of an accompanying editorial, believes that, ""PSA testing detects prostate cancer early in its natural history when it causes no symptoms. By doing so, it can save the lives of some men who would otherwise have died of the disease."" This study adds to previous evidence that PSA testing and screening for prostate cancer saves lives, he said. Still, the PSA test remains ""a blunt instrument,"" when it comes to determining the aggressiveness of a particular tumor, Neal said. ""We need better tests that identify more accurately those men destined to develop problems in the future from this disease,"" he said. In the United States, PSA testing remains a routine part of most physical exams, according to Dr. Nelson Neal Stone, a professor of urology and radiation oncology at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City. ""I would say 70 to 80 percent of physicians now order a PSA test,"" he said. ""So it is more or less the standard to care in America to get a PSA done."" Stone noted that screening detects a lot of early cancers, which do not need to be treated. ""When we see patients with low-risk disease we don't treat them, we observe them,"" he said. ""Younger men benefit most from screening, because they have the greatest risk of dying,"" Stone said. ""This study clearly supports PSA screening to prevent prostate cancer deaths."" Another expert, Dr. Anthony D'Amico, chief of radiation oncology at Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, added that ""people in good health will benefit from [PSA] screening, but people in poor health may not benefit at all."" That's because if their prostate tumor is not aggressive they are more likely to die from the other, more serious conditions, he explained.

"June 30, 2010 -- A drug used in Europe as emergency contraception may also treat painful uterine fibroids, researchers say. Their study was presented at the 26th annual meeting of the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology in Rome, Italy. As many as 80% of all women have uterine fibroids (noncancerous growths in the uterus), according to the nonprofit National Uterine Fibroids Foundation. Fibroids may cause severe abdominal pain, heavy bleeding, and interfere with fertility in some women. Surgery is often the only way to treat painful, bleeding fibroids, but surgery too can sometimes compromise fertility. Enter EllaOne, a member of a new class of drugs called selective progesterone receptor modulators. As of now, EllaOne is used in Europe as a morning-after pill because it blocks the effects of key hormones -- namely progesterone -- involved in ovulation. It is effective for up to five days after unprotected sex. Although EllaOne is not available in the U.S., an FDA advisory panel recently voted that it should be. The new drug is manufactured by HRA Pharma, a European pharmaceutical company, which provided funding for the new study. The hormone progesterone also feeds uterine fibroids, so blocking its effects may help treat painful fibroids.",0,story_reviews_01515
"* Average reductions of 0.8 pct seen in levels of A1C * Better glucose control recorded over 1-year period CHICAGO, June 29 (Reuters) - Medtronic Inc's (MDT.N) insulin pump and monitoring device controlled blood glucose levels better than multiple daily injections in patients with Type 1 diabetes, according to a large post-market study. Adult and pediatric patients using the pump and continuous glucose monitoring device saw reductions in levels of A1C, a commonly used measure of blood sugar, that were four times greater than those who received regular insulin injections in the study of 485 patients ranging from age 7 to 70. Lowering A1C levels helps reduce the risk of long-term complications from diabetes such as eye, kidney and heart disease. Patients in the study, which was presented at a meeting of the American Diabetes Association in Orlando, Florida, and sponsored by Medtronic, achieved better glucose control over a one-year period without an increase in hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar. ""What we've been able to show is that by combining this technology, you can lower the A1C, which reduces your risk of complications, and you can do it safely without increasing your rate of hypoglycemia,"" said study author Dr. Richard Bergenstal, executive director of the International Diabetes Center at Park Nicollet Health Services in Minneapolis. Multiple daily injections remain the most common approach to controlling blood sugar levels. Bergenstal said patients who are not achieving their goals with multiple daily injections should consider using a pump and sensor. Diabetes association guidelines recommend that most people with diabetes maintain A1C levels of 7.0 percent or below. In the study, patients on pump therapy saw a reduction in average A1C levels of 0.8 percent, compared with a 0.2 percent average reduction for those who received multiple injections. A1C levels on average decreased to 7.5 percent from a baseline of 8.3 percent in the group on pump therapy, but decreased to just 8.1 percent in the group receiving multiple injections.

"BEST PATIENTS FOR AN ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS BEST PATIENTS FOR AN ARTIFICIAL PANCREAS New research by Joslin Diabetes Center scientists looked at which type 1 diabetes patients are most likely to benefit from using an artificial pancreas: - Those who engage problem-solving skills to cope with frustration. - Those who see continuous glucose monitors as a way to better understand glucose patterns. - Those who have good support from spouses and significant others. Source: Marilyn Ritholz, a senior psychologist at Joslin Diabetes Center TYPE 1 DIABETES AFFECTS EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE TYPE 1 DIABETES AFFECTS EVERY ASPECT OF LIFE Type 1 diabetes is not one of those medical conditions for which you can just pop a pill and then forget about it. It forces you to think about every bite you put in your mouth, every activity you do, says Andrew Drexler, director of the Gonda Diabetes Center at UCLA. ""It's always there. You can never get away from it."" There are almost 24 million estimated cases of diabetes, according to the American Diabetes Association. Almost 10% of diagnosed cases are type 1. Experts believe the disease involves an autoimmune process that destroys insulin-producing cells in the pancreas. Insulin is a hormone needed to convert sugar, starches and other food into energy. ""We know there's a genetic component, but not everybody with that genetic component gets type 1,"" Drexler says. Type 1 is usually diagnosed in children and young adults. The most serious short-term problem is hypoglycemia, or low blood sugar, which can cause wooziness and disorientation. If it strikes while someone's driving, for instance, he's at risk for an accident. If blood sugar dips severely low, coma and death can occur. Untreated hyperglycemia, when blood sugar runs too high, can lead to long-term problems over the years, including kidney disease, blindness and limb amputation. A diagnosis can have a significant effect on mental health, says Duke endocrinologist Susan Spratt. ""Patients go through the stages of grief,"" Spratt says. ""They mourn the life they had before diabetes, a life when they could eat, exercise and sleep spontaneously,"" Spratt says. The key to managing the disease: Check blood sugar often and use insulin and other medicines to keep blood sugars steady, Drexler says. Are we close to finding a cure? ""We likely won't see any major breakthroughs soon, in the next 10 years,"" Drexler says. But Spratt says patients should remain positive. ""We have to give our patients hope that the medical community is working on a cure. Type 1 diabetes is treatable. You can live a full life and grow up, have a family and be anything you want to be."" --By Mary Brophy Marcus, USA TODAY ORLANDO  Scientists are getting closer to offering an ""artificial pancreas"" to children and adults with type 1 diabetes that will help better control the swings of blood glucose that come with the disease. Researchers working on artificial pancreas technology announced at this weekend's 70th Scientific Sessions of the American Diabetes Association that the latest tests of the technology show it can be used in real-life scenarios with success, including after eating a large meal and drinking a glass of white wine. ""The rubber is finally starting to hit the road. We're seeing more and more studies telling us it can be done and it can be done safely,"" says Aaron Kowalski, research director of the Artificial Pancreas Project for the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation. Kowalski says they believe the technology could be available within the next few years. Artificial pancreas technology has three components: •A continuous glucose monitor, attached by a slender wire to the body, that measures blood glucose levels and the direction they are trending through the day, as opposed to pricking the finger and using test strips to get a single, snapshot blood sugar reading. •An insulin pump, also attached to the body, that doses insulin continuously at a low level and can be adjusted. •A sophisticated computer program that can help the two devices ""talk"" to each other and automate the process. The first two technologies are already available. Researchers with the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation have been testing the multi-component system in a range of in-clinic situations. Earlier this year, in a study in TheLancet, they showed that the artificial pancreas technology could better control blood glucose levels during sleep and reduce the chance of hypoglycemia, or dangerously low blood sugar, in children with type 1. In this weekend's presentation, researchers reported that the benefits remained when the system was tested in 12 adults, ages 18 to 65, who ate a large meal and drank a glass of white wine before bedtime. ""It was quite a large meal — a meal like you'd eat out at a restaurant with a glass of wine. It included over 100 grams of carbohydrates,"" says lead researcher Roman Hovorka, principal research associate at the University of Cambridge Metabolic Research Laboratories. In the study, 70% of the time, participants were within their target blood glucose range, up from 47% when they didn't use the technology. Even with this technology, you're still working backward, says endocrinologist Robert Rizza, executive dean of research at the Mayo Clinic. ""It takes time for that insulin to be absorbed. Despite that fact, it's been working very well and helps avoid very high and very low blood sugars."" Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

"Ever since Alzheimer's disease was described by a German doctor, Alois Alzheimer, in 1906, there was only one way to know for sure that a person had it. A pathologist, examining the brain after death, would see microscopic black freckles, plaque, sticking to brain slices like barnacles. Without plaque, a person with memory loss did not have the disease. There is no treatment yet to stop or slow the progress of Alzheimer's. But every major drug company has new experimental drugs it hopes will work, particularly if they are started early. The questions though, are who should be getting the drugs and who really has Alzheimer's or is developing it? Even at the best medical centers, doctors often are wrong. Twenty percent of people with dementia — a loss of memory and intellectual functions — who received a diagnosis of Alzheimer's, did not have it. There was no plaque when their brains were biopsied. Half with milder memory loss, thought to be on their way to Alzheimer's, do not get the disease. And with such a high rate of misdiagnosis, some who are mistakenly told that they have Alzheimer's are not treated for conditions, like depression or low levels of thyroid hormone or drug side effects and interactions, that are causing their memory problems. Brain scans that showed plaque could help with some fundamental questions — who has or is getting Alzheimer's, whether the disease ever stops or slows down on its own and even whether plaque is the main culprit causing brain cell death. Dr. Skovronsky thought he had a way to make scans work. He and his team had developed a dye that could get into the brain and stick to plaque. They labeled the dye with a commonly used radioactive tracer and used a PET scanner to directly see plaque in a living person's brain. But the technology and the dye itself were so new they had to be rigorously tested. And that is what brought Dr. Skovronsky, a thin and eager-looking 37-year-old, to his e-mail that recent day. Five years ago, Dr. Skovronsky, who named his company Avid in part because that is what he is, had taken a big personal and professional gamble. He left academia and formed Avid Radiopharmaceuticals, based in Philadelphia , to develop his radioactive dye and designed a study with hospice patients to prove it worked. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Hospice patients were going to die soon and so, he reasoned, why not ask them to have scans and then brain autopsies afterward to see if the scans showed just what a pathologist would see. Some patients would be demented, others not. Some predicted his study would be impossible, if not unethical. But the F.D.A. said it wanted proof that the plaque on PET scans was the same as plaque in a brain autopsy. Photo The Avid study was designed to provide that proof. And the full results, contained in the e-mail message sent that day, May 14, were the moment of truth. When he saw them, Dr. Skovronsky said they were everything he had hoped for. ""This is about as good as it gets,"" he said that day. He went into a rotunda that serves as Avid's lunchroom to tell the company's 50 employees. ""This is a big day for us,"" he continued. ""I thought about what I would say, but I have totally forgotten it."" His employees applauded. Then they had champagne in blue plastic cups. A First Dye The type of scans used in this study, PET scans, are expensive and patients have to go to a scanning center, get injected with a radioactive dye, wait for the dye to reach their brain and then have a scan. Other tests are being studied — ones that look for amyloid in cerebrospinal fluid that bathes the brain; MRI scans that look for shrinkage of the brain in areas needed for memory and reasoning; PET scans that look for uptake of glucose, a cellular fuel, to show areas where the brain was active and where it was not. The tests, though, were not necessarily specific for Alzheimer's and none had been studied to see if they accurately predicted plaque on autopsy. Earlier this decade, two scientists at the University of Pittsburgh developed an amyloid dye that while not practical for widespread use, stunned scientists by showing it seemed possible to see amyloid in a living brain. The researchers, Chester Mathis and William Klunk, began their work two decades ago, persevering even though they had no research money. In the first 10 years, they tested more than 400 compounds. When they finally found one that seemed promising, they tested more than 300 variations. Advertisement Continue reading the main story ""On and on it went,"" Dr. Mathis said. Finally, in late 2001, they began working with collaborators in Sweden to test their dye in humans. On Valentine's Day 2002, the Swedish researchers injected the first Alzheimer's patient with the dye, known as Pittsburgh Compound B, and scanned the patient's brain. It worked, the Swedish doctors told Dr. Mathis in an excited phone call. A PET scan showed amyloid exactly where it would be expected. The Swedish doctors were convinced they were seeing actual plaque. They told Dr. Mathis it was time to celebrate.

View all New York Times newsletters. But Dr. Mathis worried. What if the same pattern occurred in people without Alzheimer's? Two weeks later, he got another call from Sweden. His colleagues had scanned a person without Alzheimer's. There was no sign of telltale plaques. His sweet reward came in July 2002, when the scans were shown to an audience of 5,000 scientists at an international conference on Alzheimer's. ""There was an audible gasp,"" Dr. Mathis said. ""The field was taken aback."" ""The rest is history,"" he added. Yet there was a problem. Pittsburgh Compound B used carbon 11 as its radioactive tracer. And its half-life is 20 minutes. Researchers have to make it in a cyclotron in the basement of a medical center, quickly attach it to the dye, dash over to a patient lying in a scanner, and inject it. And a critical question remained: Was a PET scan with the Pittsburgh dye really equivalent to a brain autopsy? Meanwhile, others, including Dr. Skovronsky, had another idea — use fluorine 18, with a half-life of about two hours. It could be made in the morning, and used that afternoon. And fluorine 18 is made routinely for two million cancer PET scans each year. Photo Dr. Skovronsky, starting at the University of Pennsylvania and then at Avid, worked with a University of Pennsylvania chemist, Hank Kung, for nine years to find and develop the radioactive dye. The university had the patent; Avid licensed it. Finally, on June 8, 2007, a patient at Johns Hopkins had a scan with their compound. Plaque lit up. Advertisement Continue reading the main story Most of the time, the scans were as expected — those with Alzheimer's had lots of plaque, those with normal memories had little if any and those with mild memory impairment were in between. But about 20 percent of people over 60 with normal memories had plaque. ""Then we looked more carefully,"" Dr. Skovronsky said. ""The 20 percent who had amyloid, though they were still statistically in the normal range, did worse on every memory test than the control group."" What, Dr. Skovronsky asked, did that mean? Were they starting to develop Alzheimer's? If so, could dementia be stalled if there were drugs to stop amyloid from accumulating? The definition of Alzheimer's is plaque plus memory loss and other symptoms of mental decline. But what is not known because no one could follow the development of plaque before a person died, was whether people with plaque and normal memories were developing Alzheimer's. ""We've always assumed the pathology has been there, that the plaque has been there years before symptoms,"" said Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, an Alzheimer's researcher who is vice president and dean at the University of Virginia School of Medicine. ""But we never had a way to detect plaque in living persons,"" he said. And so plaque in the brains of people with normal memories has been a puzzle. ""Over the next couple of years, we will find out what it means."" A Request of the Dying On Oct. 23, 2008, Avid and two other companies, Bayer and General Electric , that are developing fluorine 18-based dyes for amyloid scans, got a pointed question from an advisory committee to the F.D.A.: How do you know that what you are seeing on scans is the same as the amyloid you see on autopsy? It seemed impossible to answer. If researchers wait for their subjects to die before comparing scans with autopsies they can be waiting a long time. Advertisement Continue reading the main story But Avid had a plan, and the committee agreed in principle that it would work. Hospice patients would be study subjects, some with dementia, some without. All would have memory tests and brain scans. After death, their brains would be autopsied. Avid suggested that after the first 35 died, there should be enough data to know if the scans gave a true picture of the pathology. Then the F.D.A. could decide if the results were convincing enough to approve the dye for marketing. Some doctors had misgivings, wondering how they could ask people who were sick and dying to be scanned just to help Alzheimer's research. But, they found, most patients and their families agreed and said they were grateful to have been asked. That was evident on May 19, when Dr. Skovronsky gave a lunch for patients' families in Sun City, Ariz., to thank them for participating. They thanked him. ""It really touched my heart to be in this,"" said Dorothy Wall, whose husband, Claude E. Wall, died of liver cancer in Sun City on March 3. ""Something bad happens, and now something good happens."" Answers Late last year, Avid saw the initial results of its hospice study — data from the first six patients. Then, as more patients were studied, the data from them were held by a company that would analyze it. Avid did not see the results until the study was completed. But those first six were encouraging. A man diagnosed with Alzheimer's and cancer had a scan showing no plaque. His autopsy did not show it, either. The diagnosis was wrong. Another man with Parkinson's disease and dementia had been diagnosed as having dementia solely due to Parkinson's. His scan showed amyloid. So did the autopsy. He had Alzheimer's. A woman with mild memory loss had a scan showing no amyloid. Her autopsy also found none. Three others had clinical diagnoses of Alzheimer's, confirmed by scans and autopsies. Finally, on May 14, 35 patients had been scanned and autopsied. The Avid study was complete, and the full data will be presented at the meeting next month. Other companies, still doing their studies, did not yet have data to examine. And Dr. Skovronsky got that e-mail message. ""This is going to have a big impact on Alzheimer's disease, guys,"" he told his staff that day.",0,story_reviews_01523
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - An experimental drug being developed to fight influenza may fight a common but little-known virus called parainfluenza virus, researchers and the company said on Friday. Tests in rats showed Fludase, made by privately held NexBio, could stop parainfluenza viruses from replicating, the researchers reported in the Journal of Infectious Diseases. Dr. Anne Moscona of Weill Cornell Medical Center in New York and colleagues tested varying doses of the drug, also known as DAS181, in lab dishes and on cotton rats, a species accepted by scientists for testing parainfluenza. ""Therapies for parainfluenza are urgently needed,"" Moscona, an expert on parainfluenza viruses, said in a statement. ""Development of effective antiviral drugs and vaccines for human parainfluenza virus has lagged far behind influenza, despite the recognized impact of these diseases in children"" and adults, ""particularly the elderly, immunocompromised and patients with underlying airway disease."" Parainfluenza viruses are not closely related to flu but belong to another family of viruses called paramyxoviruses. They cause most cases of croup and can cause pneumonia and bronchiolitis — an inflammation of the small air passages in the lungs. There is no treatment or vaccine for parainfluenza. Fludase is already in phase 2 clinical trials for use against influenza. Adding parainfluenza to its approved indications would provide a unique and potentially large market for San Diego-based NexBio. Parainfluenza uses the same receptors — molecular doorways — to infect cells as flu does. Fludase inactivates these receptors. The researchers said that means patients with flu-like symptoms could get the drug without the need for a test to show whether their infection was caused by influenza or parainfluenza. There were some weaknesses in the study. The rats were pre-treated with the drug an hour before they were infected with parainfluenza. And infection in rats does not follow the same disease course as in humans. Moscona said tests were needed that would show the drug actually helped reduce disease symptoms in animals. A spokesman for NexBio, David Wurtman, said the company would seek Food and Drug Administration approval to test Fludase in people with parainfluenza. Because Fludase affects the human cells that viruses infect, not the virus itself, it is less likely to cause the virus to develop resistance, the company believes. Influenza viruses have already developed widespread resistance to three commonly used flu drugs — amantadine, rimantadine and Roche AG and Gilead Sciences Inc's Tamiflu. A fourth drug, GlaxoSmithKline's and Biota Inc's Relenza, works by the same mechanism as Tamiflu.",0,story_reviews_01529
"Enlarge Handout Melanoma is the most deadly form of skin cancer. CHECK UNUSUAL MOLES CHECK UNUSUAL MOLES An experimental immune therapy may provide a new way to fight advanced melanoma, a devastating cancer that often kills patients within six months. In a study of two novel treatments — a therapeutic vaccine called gp100 and an immune stimulator called ipilimumab — ipilimumab nearly doubled the number of patients surviving one year, found a study presented Saturday at the American Society of Clinical Oncology. About 25% of those given the vaccine lived one year, compared with 46% of those on ipilimumab. MELANOMA: Tanning bed link grows stronger Patients who received the vaccine lived a median of six months. Those given either ipilimumab alone or a combination of the two drugs lived about 10 months, according to the study of 670 patients, funded by Bristol-Myers Squibb and Medarex Inc., which developed ipilimumab. Doctors say that even modest success is reason for hope in this disease. Ipilimumab is the first drug to improve advanced melanoma patients' survival in a large, definitive trial, says study author Steven O'Day, director of melanoma research at the Angeles Clinic and Research Institute in Santa Monica, Calif. Ipilimumab works by harnessing the immune system's power to fight cancer, says Lynn Schuchter, chief of hematology and oncology at the University of Pennsylvania's Abramson Cancer Center, who has used the drug with her patients. The drug ""turns off the brakes"" on key disease fighters called T-cells, Schuchter says. But revving up the immune system can cause the body to attack healthy tissue, too, O'Day says. In his study, those who got the most benefit from the drug were also the most likely to develop autoimmune problems. About two-thirds of patients developed side effects such as skin rashes, diarrhea, thyroid imbalances or hepatitis. Although most complications were manageable with medication, 10% to 15% of side effects were severe. About 1.5% of patients given ipilimumab died from the treatment, mostly because of intestinal perforations, O'Day says. In comparison, ipilumumab seems relatively mild, says Matt Hershey, 43, of Lincoln University, Penn. Chemo made him nauseous and IL-2 left him barely conscious in the hospital for a week. But after two of four planned treatments with ipilimumab, Hershey says he is well enough to go to work every day. He used to run three to four miles a day. Now, jogging even one mile is difficult. But Hershey says his fatigue could be related to surgery and radiation to treat a brain metastasis, rather than ipilimumab. ""This doesn't even compare,"" Hershey says. ""For me to complain about fatigue now seems kind of silly."" Tim Turnham, executive director of the Melanoma Research Foundation, says he's especially encouraged about the findings, given that the last new therapy for metastatic melanoma, interleukin-2, was approved 12 years ago. Very little has made a dent in the cancer. ""Melanoma has been the place where research goes to die,"" he says, noting that some patient advocates had begun to dread the annual cancer meeting, knowing that they would most likely hear about another failed drug. As word leaked out of ipilimumab's promise, Turnham says melanoma patients and their families began clamoring for the drug. Still, Turnham cautions that patients shouldn't get their hopes up. ""I think we all know this isn't the answer, but maybe it points the way to an answer,"" Turnham says. ""I don't think we will find a single drug to fix melanoma. It's going to be a combination of drugs. Maybe we can find an immune therapy, a vaccine, and combine it with targeted therapies.. .. This is one time when there will be a little bit of good news. This should galvanize the community and push us all to work faster and harder."" Guidelines: You share in the USA TODAY community, so please keep your comments smart and civil.

"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A urine test can help doctors better spot prostate cancer than either the current blood test or a rectal exam alone, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday. They said Gen-Probe's Progensa PCA3 test caught about half the actual cases of prostate cancer in men who had abnormal PSA levels or digital rectal exams, and had about a 20 percent ""false positive"" rate. ""That's pretty good, actually,"" said Dr. David Crawford of the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who helped lead the study. Trying to diagnose prostate cancer is one of the most maddening tasks a doctor has. The prostate is a walnut-shaped gland that produces semen and it is hard to get to. Digital rectal exams can tell a specialist that the prostate is getting bigger, but that happens with normal aging as well as with cancer. A blood test for prostate specific antigen or PSA shows when PSA rises, but PSA goes up with either cancer or just normal enlargement of the prostate — or even if the gland is inflamed, such as from an infection. Biopsies are difficult and painful to do and may take a portion of healthy prostate, missing any tumors entirely. And prostate tumors can grow slowly. A study last year estimated that more than 1 million men in the United States alone had been needlessly treated for prostate tumors that likely would never have killed them. The Progensa test looks for a genetic material called PCA3. It is a string of RNA that does not appear to have any function but that is overexpressed, or overactive, in prostate cancer. Lightly touching the prostate can cause its release and it can then be detected in the urine using the test. Crawford and colleagues tested Progensa in about 1,900 men who had high PSA readings, an abnormal digital rectal exam or both and who were scheduled to have biopsies. ""It reflects on the aggressiveness of the cancer,"" Crawford said. ""If you had no cancer your PCA3 was at 25 or 20. If you had precursors such as high grade PIN (prostatic intraepithelial neoplasia) your score was about 38 to 40 and men who had cancer scored about 50 to 55."" The test had a specificity of 78 percent, meaning that 78 percent of the men who had cancer indicated by the test actually did. This compares to just 21 percent for PSA alone, the researchers told a meeting of the American Urological Association in San Francisco. ""If the PCA3 is abnormal, above about 35, you have got an 80 percent chance of having cancer,"" Crawford said. The test had a sensitivity of 49 percent, meaning it correctly identified 49 percent of cancers. This is far less sensitive than PSA, which catches 87 percent of tumors, but if the two tests are used together they can help rule out the need for unnecessary surgery or radiation. Among the 1,946 men studied, 42 percent turned out to have prostate cancer. The test was approved for use in Europe in 2006 but is not yet approved in the United States.",0,story_reviews_01543
"June 2, 2010 (San Francisco) -- A quick spray of a new drug may help men who suffer from premature ejaculation last nearly six times longer, new research suggests. The numbers aren't huge. Men who sprayed the head of their penis with PSD502 five minutes before sex lasted an average of just over three minutes after three months of treatment, compared with just over 30 seconds before. Nonetheless, doctors like Irwin Goldstein, MD, director of San Diego Sexual Medicine at Alvarado Hospital in San Diego, tell WebMD they're excited because this is the first time a drug is being rigorously tested for men with really serious premature ejaculation problems. Up to 30% of men suffer some degree of premature ejaculation, defined as ejaculation that occurs within one minute of vaginal penetration. It's the No. 1 sexual health problem in men. Premature ejaculation can be devastating for both a man and his partner, triggering anxiety, depression, and relationship problems, says Goldstein, who heard the results presented at the annual meeting of the American Urological Association. Not all men with premature ejaculation suffer to the same degree as the men in the study, says researcher Ira Sharlip, MD, clinical professor of urology at the University of California, San Francisco. He consults for Shionogi Pharma Inc., which makes the spray and funded the work. ""Yet I think a substantial number of [men with premature ejaculation] would use it,"" he tells WebMD, alternatives being unproven products with names like ""Stay Erect"" and ""Play Longer."" At the meeting, Sharlip presented the pooled results of two pivotal studies of PSD502 involving 530 men with premature ejaculation. A total of 358 of the men gave themselves three quick sprays of PSD502 to the head of the penis five minutes before sex and then wiped it off right before penetration. PSD502, which contains two common topical painkillers, lidocaine and prilocaine, is ""slightly oily, but not objectionably so,"" Sharlip says. The rest of the men used a placebo spray. All used the product for three months, for a total of 23,000 doses.",0,story_reviews_01546
"An experimental spray improved sex for some men who regularly experience premature ejaculation, according to the results of two studies set to be presented Tuesday at a urology conference. Men who applied the aerosol spray, a mixture of the anesthetics lidocaine and prilocaine, reached orgasm a mean of 3 minutes 18 seconds after beginning sex, compared with about 56 seconds for those who got a placebo spray. The 539 men completing the two studies, who were randomly assigned to the real drug or the fake version, had an average time of less than 36 seconds before they took part in the research. That meant the drug was linked to a 5.5-fold increase in time before ejaculation, compared to a 1.6-fold gain for the placebo. The increase is ""clinically significant,"" says Tom Lue, a professor of urology at the University of California, San Francisco, who wasn't involved in the research. ""People will be much happier."" The primary findings of both trials had previously been made public, but researchers combined them and added new data in abstracts set to be presented Tuesday at the American Urological Association's annual meeting in San Francisco. The studies lasted three months, but researchers allowed participants to choose to continue with the drug. Its effectiveness apparently didn't diminish over a span as long as nine additional months. Men who used the spray rated their sexual experiences significantly higher on measures of control and satisfaction, and reported less distress than those who got placebo, according to the researchers. The spray, currently referred to as PSD502, hasn't won regulatory approval to be marketed. The company that owns rights to the product, Japan's Shionogi & Co. Ltd., says it hopes to apply to the Food and Drug Administration and is already in discussions with the agency. Doctors are not sure what causes men to have the problem, which may involve an abnormality of the central nervous system or extreme nerve sensitivity in the penis that leads ejaculation to be triggered. Psychological factors may also play a role. Treatment for premature ejaculation has long been seen as a potentially lucrative opportunity for drug makers, which found major success with drugs for erectile dysfunction, a condition that was also once considered taboo for public discussion. Surveys have suggested that as many as 20% to 30% of men may suffer from premature ejaculation, though these figures are often drawn from broadly worded survey questions and may overstate the number of men with significant problems. The field suffered a setback in 2005, when the FDA rejected an application from Johnson & Johnson to market a drug called Priligy; the agency doesn't typically reveal its reasons for such decisions publicly. To date no treatment has won the FDA's nod for use in premature ejaculation. The J&J drug, which works similarly to antidepressants such as Prozac, has been approved for use in 12 countries, including Germany and South Korea. A company spokeswoman says Johnson & Johnson is ""evaluating its path forward in the U.S."" for Priligy. In the U.S., men can try certain antidepressants or numbing creams, which aren't FDA-approved for premature ejaculation, or work with a sex therapist or psychologist. These are ""less-than-perfect alternatives,"" says Anthony Smith, a urologist at the University of New Mexico who was not involved in the research on PSD502. The spray may work by damping excessive sensitivity, says Ira Sharlip, a clinical professor at the University of California, San Francisco who was involved in the PSD502 research. It is sprayed on the tip of the penis five minutes before sex. In the studies, men and their partners were given stopwatches to time the length of their intercourse. Dr. Sharlip says the spray doesn't generally lead to numbness, a problem men might fear from a product involving lidocaine, which many associate with killing the pain of dental procedures. Prilocaine is also sometimes used as a numbing agent in dentistry. About 6.9% of the men reported side effects, with the most common being loss of erection, seen in 3%, or at least some loss of sensation, in 1.7%. Also, 0.6% of the men's female partners reported at least some loss of sensation. In all cases, the issues were temporary, the researchers said.

"En Español TUESDAY, May 25, 2010 (HealthDay News) --Giving certain breast cancer patients estrogen-lowering drugs before surgery enhances their chances of being able to choose a breast-conserving lumpectomy instead of a full mastectomy, new research suggests. The observation was based on a national study launched at 118 hospitals across the United States. It focused on postmenopausal women who had been diagnosed with estrogen receptor-positive (ER+) breast cancer that was either at stage II or stage III -- that is, tumors that were around an inch or greater in size and might have spread to the lymph nodes under the arm. The most common form of breast cancer, ER+ accounts for about three-quarters of all breast cancer cases in the United States, the authors noted. The 352 women who participated were monitored for tumor growth before and after being placed on a 16-week regimen of aromatase inhibitors -- estrogen-lowering agents -- before any surgery. Estrogen stimulates the growth of ER+ tumors. The women were classified into three groups as the study began: ""marginal"", meaning that the women were eligible for a lumpectomy to conserve the breast, but that it would be disfiguring or require several operations; ""mastectomy-only"", meaning a lumpectomy was not considered possible; and ""inoperable"", meaning that doctors believed that even a mastectomy would not completely remove the cancer. After the four months of estrogen-lowering therapy, the research team found that 82 percent of those women in the marginal group were, in fact, able to undergo successful breast-conservation surgery. More than half of those women who had been categorized as mastectomy-only patients were also able to go the lumpectomy route and experience a good outcome. And 75 percent of those thought to be inoperable altogether were able to have breast-conservation surgery. The investigation was funded by the American College of Surgeons Oncology Group and led by Dr. Julie A. Margenthaler, an assistant professor of surgery and a breast surgeon at the Siteman Cancer Center at Washington University in St. Louis. ""Aromatase inhibitor therapy shrank the tumors in many of these women and improved surgical outcomes,"" study chair Dr. Matthey J. Ellis, a breast cancer specialist at Washington University and Barnes-Jewish Hospital, said in a news release. ""These results will encourage a change in practice across the country so that more women can benefit from the currently underutilized approach of administering estrogen-lowering agents before surgery."" The findings are scheduled to be presented June 7 at the American Society of Clinical Oncology annual meeting, in Chicago.

"CHICAGO (Reuters) - An experimental cancer drug showed early promise at helping patients with advanced melanoma that had spread to the brain, according to a summary of data from a mid-stage study. Bristol-Myers Squibb's closely watched biotechnology drug ipilimumab, which enlists the help of the immune system to attack tumors, was found generally safe and showed signs that it was working on tumors in the brain, which are especially difficult to treat. The study is the first to test ipilimumab in patients whose skin cancer had spread to the brain, and the findings, released in an abstract or brief summary, support its potential use in these patients, the researchers said. The abstract was one of thousands of studies released on Thursday ahead of presentation at the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO) next month in Chicago. Ipilimumab is a monoclonal antibody, an engineered human immune system protein that boosts the body's immune response by interfering with another immune compound called CTLA-4, which acts as a sort of brake on immune system cells. By temporarily removing this brake, the hope is to unleash the immune system to find and destroy the cancer. Results of a late-stage study of the drug in melanoma patients will be detailed in a ""late-breaker"" session at ASCO's annual meeting in June. In the phase 2 trial, researchers said four out of 51 patients with at least one brain lesion had a partial response to the drug, and in 5 out of 51 patients, both brain and other tumors in the body stabilized after 12 weeks of treatment. The responses lasted from three to 12 months, and patients had no serious toxic side effects. Data from a second arm of the study is still being evaluated. A separate study of the drug also showed signs it could work in people who first appeared not to respond to the drug. Researchers reintroduced the drug to 32 patients who were initially treated as part of a study of 634 patients. Eight of the 32 got ipilimumab alone, 23 got ipilimumab plus a vaccine called gp100, and one got the vaccine alone. All of the treatments appeared safe. The team found that in patients whose cancer initially progressed while on ipilimumab, whose who were reintroduced to the drug had a disease control rate of 65 to 75 percent, compared to zero in the patient who got the vaccine only. ""These findings may have implications for the use of ipilimumab therapy in the long-term management of advanced melanoma,"" the researchers reported in the abstract. Melanoma accounts for about 3 percent of skin cancer cases but causes most skin cancer deaths, and doctors have few effective treatments to offer once the disease has spread. According to the American Cancer Society, melanoma accounted for more than 68,000 cases of skin cancer in 2009, and 8,650 deaths.",0,story_reviews_01554
"Houston scientists say test may show ovarian cancer early Finding a ‘silent killer' A new strategy involving a simple blood test is a ‘step forward' in detecting ovarian cancer early Liz Stegall's ovarian cancer was detected as part of the initial study, and now she is ""ecstatic"" to be cancer-free. Liz Stegall's ovarian cancer was detected as part of the initial study, and now she is ""ecstatic"" to be cancer-free. Photo: Brett Coomer, Chronicle Photo: Brett Coomer, Chronicle Image 1 of / 3 Caption Close Houston scientists say test may show ovarian cancer early 1 / 3 Back to Gallery Houston researchers have demonstrated a promising new way to detect ovarian cancer early, a long-sought tool in the battle against the disease known as ""the silent killer"" because it's usually not diagnosed until it's difficult to treat. University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center researchers Thursday reported the results of a study that showed a simple blood test, tracked over time and followed by an ultrasound if needed, accurately picks up the disease in early, more curable stages. There is no such screening tool currently in use. ""This is an important step forward in the effort to develop an early detection system for this very lethal disease,"" said Dr. Karen Lu, a professor in M.D. Anderson's department of gynecologic oncology and the study's principal investigator. ""If the study's findings are confirmed in larger studies, I think this new strategy will be practice-changing."" The method used in the nine-year study of 3,252 initially healthy postmenopausal women caught five ovarian cancers, three of them invasive. There were only a few false positives. Lu said the study isn't large enough to justify recommending yet. But she added that an ongoing study in the United Kingdom involving 200,000 women should more definitively determine the test's value. That study is due to show results in 2015. Ovarian cancer, though rare, is the fourth-leading cancer killer among U.S. women. In 2009, according to the American Cancer Society, it was diagnosed in 21,550 women and killed 14,600. More than 75 percent of women are diagnosed when the disease has already become advanced. Blood test for protein The new strategy involves an existing blood test for a protein discovered in the 1980s by an M.D. Anderson researcher and long used for predicting ovarian cancer recurrence. The protein, known as CA-125, has not been good at identifying new early-stage ovarian cancer because it can become elevated for other reasons, leading to false positives. In the last decade, hopeful of finding a better test, ovarian cancer researchers have invested much time in the investigation of other biomarkers and technologies. But none proved as accurate as CA-125 after a Harvard scientist developed a mathematical model combining trends in test results and a patient's age. Follow-up recommended One expert said the study is an important step but definitely needs follow-up work. ""It's a well-done study about which its authors are appropriately careful in their conclusions,"" said Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy medical director at the American Cancer Society. ""But more research and refining needs to be done before it should be implemented. I can remember when doctors all rushed to adopt the Prostate Specific Antigen test, and we still don't know how to use it."" Lu acknowledged there are comparisons to the PSA test, which has come under fire in recent years for being better at detecting prostate cancer than improving survival. But Lu said that if the UK study replicates her results, the ovarian cancer test would have the advantage of producing much fewer false positives and being able to spot aggressive cancers. Study participants were grouped as low, medium or high risk based on how much their CA-125 levels changed over time. Low-risk women repeated the blood test in a year, medium-risk women were referred for an ultrasound, and high-risk women had exploratory surgery. Over the study's nine years, 85 women had ultrasounds and eight had surgery. Three of the eight turned out to have benign tumors. Ultrasounds cost $300, and the blood test costs $150. A real life-saver Among the study participants was Liz Stegall, who enrolled at the request of the family of Linda Nelson Taylor, a friend who died of ovarian cancer that wasn't diagnosed until it was advanced. Stegall had no family cancer history, but six years into the study last year, she was diagnosed with early stage disease after a blood test showed a spike in her CA-125 levels. ""I would say I'm ecstatic,"" said Stegall, 59, of Sugar Land, who finished treatment at the end of December and is cancer free. ""This new test came too late to save Linda, but thanks to her and it, I should be alive for some time still. And if I can be saved, so can other people."" The study results were unveiled Thursday in advance of a major cancer conference next month. More than half of the women in the study came from Houston. Besides M.D. Anderson, the participating institutions were The Woman's Hospital of Texas, Baylor University Medical Center in Dallas, Women and Infants Hospital in Providence, R.I., and John Stoddard Cancer Center in Des Moines, Iowa. todd.ackerman@chron.com",0,story_reviews_01555
"HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS HEALTH REPORTER TWEETS AUTISM AT A GLANCE AUTISM AT A GLANCE Autism is an umbrella name for a family of disorders that begin in childhood, last a lifetime and disrupt a person's social and communication skills. Prevalence • 1 in 110 U.S. children is diagnosed with autism. Boys are four times more likely than girls to have autism. • 1 million to 1.5 million Americans have an autism spectrum disorder Diagnosis • Less than a decade ago, the disease was diagnosed at age 3 or 4. Now it is routinely diagnosed at 2. • Symptoms range from mild to severe. Many people with autism display rigid routines and repetitive behaviors. Treatment • There is no single treatment for children with autism. Most respond best to structured behavioral programs. Cost • Lifetime cost of caring for a child with autism: $3.5 million to $5 million • Annual U.S. cost: $90 billion Source: Autism Society of America and Autism Speaks A popular autism diet free of cereal grains and dairy products did not improve symptoms in children, shows a small study to be reported Saturday. Up to a third of children with autism are put on special diets like the one tested in the new study, the researchers say. The diets are based on the theory that people with autism don't digest cereal grains and dairy products completely, so they tend to absorb toxic byproducts. ""Subsequent studies have not confirmed this to be true,"" says Susan Hyman, a University of Rochester pediatrician who led the new study, which she'll report at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Philadelphia. Still, many parents and teachers say they've seen improvement when children with autism stop eating these foods. But, Hyman says, behavioral therapy, not their diets, might deserve credit. The scientists say theirs is the most tightly controlled autism diet study so far. They tried to ensure that their subjects were as similar as possible, cutting the chance that factors besides diet would affect symptoms. Fourteen children with autism, ages 2½ to 5½, completed the 18-week study. None had celiac disease, in which the lining of the small intestine is damaged from gluten, or milk allergies. COURT: Thimerosal in vaccine didn't cause autism AUTISM: More likely in kids of older parents VIDEO: Rethink Autism helps families Their families stuck to a strict diet free of gluten — proteins in wheat, rye, barley — and casein, the main protein in milk and other dairy products. After they had been on the diet for at least four weeks, they were ""challenged"" once a week with a snack containing wheat flour, non-fat dried milk, both or neither. Dietitians created snacks that looked, tasted and felt the same, whether they contained gluten or casein. Every child received each snack three times. Parents, teachers and a research assistant completed standardized surveys about their behavior the day before they received the snack, then two hours and 24 hours afterward. Parents also kept a diary of their children's diet and their sleep and bowel habits. The researchers assessed social interaction and language by watching taped play sessions. They found no adverse changes in behavior after the snacks containing wheat, milk or both. ""This is a small study,"" Hyman acknowledges. ""Families will continue to try the diet, and that's OK."" But, she says, they must ensure their growing children receive adequate nutrition. Pamela Compart, co-author of The Kid-Friendly ADHD and Autism Cookbook, calls the study ""clean and well thought out."" But, says Compart, a pediatrician in Columbia, Md., who trained with Hyman, researchers may have seen behavioral changes if they had looked 72 hours after the snacks or if they also had eliminated soy from kids' diets. ""If you're able to keep them well-nourished, I think it's worth every child trying it,"" Compart says of the special diet. ""People would not stay on this diet if they didn't think it was working."" Hyman and Compart agree on the need for further scientific investigation into the role of diet in autism.

"By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, May 19, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers hope that a simple brain scan performed in infants and toddlers can presage the development of autism, leading to early detection and early intervention. The test involved using functional MRI to measure brain responses to spoken words in sleeping children. ""We're focusing on this earliest time period, when the brain is still developing and still changing,"" explained study author Lisa Eyler, an assistant professor of psychiatry at the University of California, San Diego. ""If we could use this with other markers, we could probably identify people early on and, if we could do that, we'd have a much better chance of helping to make sure that their language development is normal."" The finding is slated to be presented Wednesday at the International Meeting for Autism Research in Philadelphia. But another expert pointed out that the study is still extremely preliminary. ""It's a very early study. They have a long way to go before they're actually able to implement a test like this,"" said Keith Young, vice chairman of research in psychiatry and behavioral science at the Texas A&M Health Science Center College of Medicine in Temple. Before bringing it to clinics, researchers need to make sure this test isn't detecting other developmental delays such as dyslexia, he noted. ""I wouldn't want to be telling people your kid has autism when the problem is that they're dyslexic,"" Young said. And when it is ready for prime time, it probably won't be applicable to all children with autism. ""This is probably not going to be used for wide-scale screening but it could be used for children who we have some sense that they have autism and want to gather more information,"" said David Amaral, president of the International Society for Autism Research and research director of the University of California Davis MIND Institute. ""There are many, many different types of autism. There are some children with autism who don't have these specific abnormalities in brain function."" Right now, experts have little to go by in detecting autism other than carefully monitoring the regular developmental milestones in children, Young said. ""We do need something,"" he said. ""One of the hallmark features of autism is deficits in language acquisition,"" Eyler explained. ""Whereas the typical developing kid will have an explosion of their language ability starting at about 12 months in both comprehension and production, kids in autism delay don't start comprehending or producing until later, and they don't ever have that kind of explosion. About 50 percent of kids with autism never develop language,"" she noted. ""We were interested in what was going on in the earliest period of life that could account for these differences,"" she continued. For this study, Eyler and her colleagues monitored the brain activity of 30 children with an autism spectrum disorder (aged 14 months to 46 months) and 14 ""typical"" children of roughly the same age. Children slept in the MRI machine while researchers read them bedtime stories. This allowed the investigators to see which parts of the brain were being activated in typical children versus children with autism. ""We were looking for areas of the brain that are more responsive during listening to bedtime stories than when they're not hearing that,"" Eyler said. In the typically developing children, both sides of the brain involved in language processing were activated. In the youngest children, the activation was about equal in both the right and left hemisphere, while in the older children, activity became more pronounced on the left side, which is similar to adult patterns and to be expected, Eyler explained. But in the autistic children, there was slightly more right hemisphere response than left hemisphere, and there was no change in activity across the age range. ""We didn't see that growth of the left hemisphere [in the children with autism],"" Eyler said. ""We now feel pretty confident that, in many children with autism, there are alterations either in structure growth or connectivity of the brain, but we really don't understand the implications of that for core features of autism, one of which is problems with communication,"" Amaral said. ""This provides more evidence for abnormal connectivity in the brain."" More information The Autism Society of America has more on this disorder.",0,story_reviews_01557
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A drug approved to treat a range of conditions may also work to prevent lung cancer in people who have given up smoking, U.S. researchers reported on Tuesday. The drug, called iloprost, is approved in inhaled forms to treat pulmonary hypertension, when blood pools near the lungs, a connective tissue disease called scleroderma and a nerve condition called Raynaud's phenomenon. Dr. Robert Keith of the Denver Veterans Affairs Medical Center and colleagues tested an oral version to see if it might prevent lung cancer in smokers and former smokers. ""Oral iloprost showed promise for preventing lung cancer in former, but not current, smokers in a phase II clinical trial,"" they wrote in a summary presented to a meeting of the American Thoracic Society in New Orleans. Iloprost is a version of prostacyclin, a drug in the prostaglandin class that prevents lung cancer in mice. Keith, who has been testing several drugs to prevent lung cancer, looked at biopsies taken from the lungs of 125 current and former smokers. They treated half with placebo and half with iloprost, and then performed bronchoscopy examinations to assess precancerous changes in the lungs. Six months later, ""former smokers showed significant improvements on all measures, indicating that treatment with iloprost may reduce the risk of developing lung cancer among former smokers,"" the researchers said. ""Interestingly, current smokers did not show any significant improvements,"" they added. ""Oral iloprost significantly improves endobronchial dysplasia in former smokers and deserves further study to determine if it can prevent the development of lung cancer."" ITALIAN RESEARCH Swiss drug maker Actelion markets inhaled iloprost under the brand name Ventavis. It is also sold in an intravenous form under the trade name Ilomedin by Schering, acquired by Merck. In April, researchers said a natural supplement derived from food, called myo-inositol, seems to stop the precancerous changes that lead to lung cancer. Cigarette smoke causes 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer, which kills 1.2 million people a year globally. But only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes like heart disease, stroke or emphysema. Separately, Italian researchers reported that advanced lung cancer patients given the targeted therapy drug Tarceva as so-called maintenance treatment — after they finished a course of standard chemotherapy — lived a little bit longer. Federico Cappuzzo from Ospedale Civile di Livorno in Italy and colleagues did a phase 3 trial in 889 patients who had already had chemotherapy and whose tumors had not come back. They received either Tarceva, a drug sold by Roche and OSI Pharmaceuticals and known generically as erlotinib, or a placebo until they got worse or died. The patients who got Tarceva lived a little longer without their tumors growing — 12 weeks versus 11 weeks on average and they lived a month longer on average — 12 months versus 11 months. This was seen even among patients who did not have the EGFR genetic mutation that Tarceva targets, they reported in Lancet Oncology. Fewer than half of all lung cancer patients who do well after a first course of chemotherapy get more treatment, but the Italian group said their study shows this is worth doing.",0,story_reviews_01559
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A daily dose of electricity delivered to a specific part of the brain can lift depression, new research confirms, even for people who've already tried multiple antidepressants to no avail. While there's evidence that this technique, known as transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS), helps depressed people get better-and the US Food and Drug Administration has approved TMS for this purpose-many skeptics have questioned whether it really works, notes Dr. Mark S. George of the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston, the lead author of the new study. The biggest issue with studies so far, he explained, has been that it's tough to fake the sound and sensation of the real device in order to run a gold standard clinical trial in which some people get the treatment, and others get a sham treatment, no one knowing which. But George and his team say they've solved that problem by developing a dummy device that clicks in a similar way to the real thing and causes a person's eye muscles to twitch, just like real a TMS device. In the May issue of the Archives of General Psychiatry, George and his colleagues report the results of their 190-patient study, the most rigorous investigation of TMS for depression so far. The researchers randomly assigned participants to receive 37.5 minutes of TMS delivered to a part of the brain region that plays a role in emotion, or 37.5 minutes of sham TMS, once a day for three weeks. After three weeks, 14 percent of patients in the real TMS group had recovered from their depression, compared to 5 percent of the sham TMS group; people who had the real treatment were four times as likely to get better as those who got the fake treatment. Based on the results, George and his team say, it would be necessary to treat 12 depressed patients with TMS in order to have one patient recover. Eighty-eight percent of the study participants completed the first phase of the trial. Patients in both groups were equally likely to report side effects, which included headache, discomfort at the TMS site, and eye twitching. In a second phase of the study, all patients were given the real TMS treatment. Thirty percent of the patients in the second phase recovered from depression. How long the treatment should last is not yet clear. ""It's very muddy now exactly how long we need to treat patients,"" George said. ""It looks as if from this trial you at least need to try three weeks and maybe even six weeks before you would give up."" Patients who got better were prescribed venlafaxine - marketed as Effexor — and a small dose of lithium, noted George, a combination that's been shown to help people stay well after their depression has remitted. George said he and his colleagues would like to study whether giving people TMS intermittently instead of putting them on antidepressants would produce equally durable effects. TMS works by producing an electrical current that can pass through the skull and into the target area of the brain. George said he believes the approach works by ""resetting"" electrical activity and restoring normal mood regulation. Something similar is likely happening, he added, with electroconvulsive therapy (ECT), or what is sometimes referred to as ""electroshock treatment."" Sixty to 70 percent of depressed people who undergo ECT, in which electrodes placed on the front of the brain induce a convulsion while the patient is anesthetized, will recover. George said he hopes that by better understanding where TMS should be delivered and by figuring out the best dose and duration of treatment, success rates closer to those of ECT might be achieved. ""I'm optimistic that it's pointing us in a path of understanding how to interact with the brain in a non-invasive way to get people well.""

"SUNDAY, May 2, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- One reason many people dread a colonoscopy is the unpleasant preparation, which often requires that they drink a gallon of prescribed fluids to clear out their bowels before the procedure. But an industry-funded study suggests that a pill could negate the need for so much liquid. Researchers from Henry Ford Hospital report that people preparing for the test were able to take a pill approved as a treatment for chronic constipation and avoid half of the liquid requirement. In the study, 126 people took either the pill -- lubiprostone (Amitiza) -- or an inactive placebo. Those who took the combination of the pill and liquid were better able to tolerate the preparation than were those who drank a gallon of a mixture of polyethylene glycol and electrolytes, the study found. ""Most people say they don't want to have a colonoscopy because they find the preparation intolerable,"" the study's lead author, Dr. Chetan Pai, a gastroenterologist, said in a news release from the hospital. ""If physicians are able to offer a better way to prep, I think this will encourage more people to get the colonoscopies that may save their lives."" Pai also pointed out that about 90 percent of colon cancer cases occur in people older than 50, an age group that tends to have an especially hard time drinking the gallon of liquid often prescribed for colonoscopy preparation. The study, scheduled to be presented Sunday at the Digestive Diseases Week conference in New Orleans, was funded by the pill's manufacturer, Sucampo Pharmaceuticals.

"By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, April 21, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Researchers are reporting that a drug is showing promise in early testing as a possible new treatment for hepatitis C, a stubborn and potentially deadly liver ailment. It's too early to tell if the drug actually works, and it will be years before it's ready to seek federal approval to be prescribed to patients. Still, the drug -- or others like it in development -- could add to the power of new drugs in the pipeline that are poised to cure many more people with hepatitis C, said Dr. Eugene R. Schiff, director of the University of Miami's Center for Liver Diseases. The greater possibility of a cure and fewer side effects, in turn, will lead more people who think they have hepatitis C to ""come out of the woodwork,"" said Schiff, who's familiar with the study findings. ""They'll want to know if they're positive."" An estimated 4 million people in the United States have hepatitis C, but only about 1 million are thought to have been diagnosed. The disease, transmitted through infected blood, can lead to liver cancer, scarring of the liver, known as cirrhosis, and death. Existing treatments can cure about half of the cases. As Schiff explained, people's genetic makeup has a lot to do with whether they respond to the treatment. Those with Asian heritage do better, whereas those with an African background do worse, he said. And there's another potential problem with existing treatments. The side effects, particularly of the treatment component known as interferon, can be ""pretty hard to deal with,"" said Nicholas A. Meanwell, a co-author of the study and a researcher with the Bristol-Myers Squibb pharmaceutical company. The study, published online April 21 in Nature, examines an experimental drug designed to combat the hepatitis C virus. It appears to work by interfering with a protective coating around a part of the virus that's key to its ability to reproduce, Meanwell said. In a phase 1 trial, the first of three types of studies that new drugs must go through, researchers gave doses of the drug to a small number of people. The level of the virus in their bodies dropped significantly for several days. The main side effect was headache, Meanwell said. At this point, it's not clear how much the drug might cost or how it would work with existing drugs. However, Meanwell said, it could become part of a combination treatment of several drugs. Schiff, the University of Miami doctor, said other companies are pursuing similar drugs. For now, much of the attention in the world of liver disease is on two drugs -- telaprevir and boceprevir -- that Schiff expects will become available within the next year and a half. Combination treatments using these drugs will become the standard treatment for many people, he said, and boost cure rates into the range of 70 to 80 percent. The drugs now under development, like the one in the new study, could be added to the regimen, he said.

"By Richard Knox Somewhere north of 90 million Americans are at risk of lung cancer because they're current or former smokers. Many are tempted to get a CT lung scan, costing $300 to $1,000, to see if something's lurking. A CT scan of the lungs picks up signals of cancer. (iStockphoto.com) The idea has obvious appeal. After all, up to 30 percent of lung malignancies have already spread by the time they're diagnosed. And CT scans can detect tumors smaller than a pea. Small and early should mean curable, right? Well, it's not so simple. An analysis of lung cancer screening results in 3,200 people from the National Cancer Institute finds that 21 to 33 percent of the suspicious nodules found by CT scans are false alarms. They're not really cancer. These ""false positives"" cause a good deal of anxiety, of course. To clear up the mystery, seven percent of patients undergo bronchoscopy -- a procedure involving a tube threaded into the lungs -- or have needles stuck into their lungs to retrieve a biopsy sample. Or they undergo exploratory lung surgery. Patients who undergo screening with conventional chest x-rays have false positives too, but less often -- 15 percent after two rounds of screening. These false-positive rates may be under-estimates, say NCI officials, because in the study only lung nodules larger than 4 millimeters across (about an 0.16 inches) are followed up. Smaller ones are thought to pose minimal risk. But in typical medical practice, all suspicious nodules are usually investigated. The results appear in the Annals of Internal Medicine. The extra scans and biopsies triggered by a false positive add around $1,100 per patient to the cost of lung cancer screening. They also expose people to additional radiation, which can cause cancer itself. The false-positive problem is only one of the issues surrounding lung cancer screening. Experts worry that some malignancies might never pose a risk to patients, leading to unnecessary treatment. It's also not clear whether the increased survival times reported in some studies among patients whose lung cancer was detected through screening may only reflect that a tumor was found earlier, not that death was really delayed. Experts call this ""lead-time bias."" The NCI is running a clinical trial in which 53,000 current and former smokers were randomly assigned to get CT scans or chest x-rays to screen for lung cancer. The National Lung Screening Trial is designed to see if one test is better than another in terms of preventing death from lung cancer. The results are expected sometime in the next year or two.",0,story_reviews_01581
"Part of an ongoing series looking at the reality behind health claims. The claim: Lipodissolve, a series of drug injections, can dissolve and permanently remove small pockets of fat from various parts of the body. The process is also known as injection lipolysis, lipozap, lipotherapy, and mesotherapy. Reality: Though it's easier than eating right and exercising, the products used to perform the procedure are not approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for fat removal and the agency has issued a consumer warning about false and misleading claims, said Dr. Janet Woodcock director of FDA's Center for Drug Evaluation and Research. Moreover, the FDA says it's ""not aware"" of clinical studies showing lipodissolve is effective or safe. Unexpected side effects include permanent scarring, skin deformation, and deep, painful knots under the skin in areas where the lipodissolve treatments were injected according to the FDA. The drugs most regularly used in the lipodissolve injection regimen are phosphatidylcholine (PC) and deoxycholate (DC). Other ingredients may also be used, including drugs or components of other products such as vitamins, minerals, and herbal extracts. Earlier this week, the FDA announced it had sent warning lettersto six medical spas in the United States—and a cyber letter to a company in Brazil—for making false or misleading statements on their Web sites about drugs used in the procedure. For example, some of the companies have made claims that lipodissolve is superior to liposuction or that it can be used to treat certain medical conditions, such as male breast enlargement, benign fatty growths known as lipomas, excess fat deposits and surgical deformities.

"-- Avoid what are commonly called simple carbohydrates and ""sugary stuff"" at that meal or at bedtime. Such foods will bump up insulin production. ""When our insulin is very high, we can't get to sleep,"" he says. Instead, choose whole-wheat crackers, which can control insulin. Or eat turkey or bananas, both of which contain tryptophan, which is believed to trigger sleepiness. Lettuce, too, has a ""long history of helping people get to sleep,"" Aziz says. -- Avoid caffeinated coffee, tea and soda. And alcohol, which Aziz says ""can make us go to sleep, but it's not the deep sleep"" that we need to produce growth hormone (which in turn helps regulate insulin). -- Practice good sleep hygiene. That means turning off all electronics, including the TV, and creating as quiet a sleep space as you can. Lower blinds and turn off lights so your room is as dark as possible. Make sure the room temperature is comfortable. Consider taking a warm bath or doing some gentle stretches -- but not heart-pumping exercise -- before turning in. Okay, so just how long are we supposed to stay asleep? Robert Vorona, a sleep researcher at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk, says adults should aim for 7 to 7 1/2 hours a night, while teenagers need a whopping 9 to 9 1/4 hours. (Fellow parents, let's do the math. If your teen has to get up at, say, 6:30 to be at school by 7:30, that means bedtime's at 9:15 or 9:30 p.m.) Vorona says he'd like to delve deeper into the sleep-obesity question. He applied for funding of the research a few years ago, to no avail. ""It's a shame,"" he says. ""It's such an intriguing idea. If sleep extension could have a salutary effect on helping people lose weight,"" he says, we'd have another tool in the fight against obesity. On the other hand, Vorona says, ""The last thing I want readers to think is that Dr. Vorona thinks we're facing this obesity epidemic because we're sleep deprived. I suspect it's part of the picture, along with lack of exercise and dietary indiscretion.""",0,story_reviews_01591
"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Researchers have identified a group of genes that are especially active in lung cancer patients — even in healthy tissue — and said they may be used to predict which smokers will eventually develop lung cancer. An undated handout image of cells obtained by airway brushing. REUTERS/Avrum Spira/Handout And, they said, a natural supplement derived from food that is being tested to prevent lung cancer appears to halt the precancerous changes. ""Even in normal cells or premalignant cells prior to cancer development we see this pathway being turned on,"" said Andrea Bild of the University of Utah, who worked on the study published in the journal Science Translational Medicine. The main gene is called PI3K and it affects a pathway of other genes, Bild, Avrum Spira of Boston University and colleagues reported. And it can be found in the windpipes of smokers, meaning they do not need more dangerous and uncomfortable lung tests. ""These cells are like a canary in the coal mine,"" Spira said in a telephone interview. ""Even though lung cancer develops deep down in your lungs when you smoke, these cells can tell you whether you are on the way to developing lung cancer. It is sort of a window into the lung."" Cigarette smoke causes 90 percent of all cases of lung cancer, which kills 1.2 million people a year globally. But only about 10 percent of smokers ever develop lung cancer, although they often die of other causes such as heart disease, stroke or emphysema. Spira and Bild put together results from two ongoing trials of smokers. ""The patients walk in the door and they have something wrong with them — we don't know what. Maybe they have lung cancer, maybe they have something else,"" Bild said in a telephone interview. Lung cancer is so deadly precisely because it causes vague symptoms. Most patients are not diagnosed until it has spread and can no longer be treated. ACTIVE GENES The researchers used a brush to collect cells from the windpipes of the smokers. They put these on a gene chip or microarray to see which genes were active in the cells. ""We found this certain pathway, PI3K, was turned on in patients that had lung cancer as opposed to patients that had other problems,"" Bild said. PI3K had long been suspected in lung cancer. But another experiment got the researchers more excited. These were patients with precancerous lesions in their lungs called dysplasia. PI3K was also active in their lesions. And the second group was taking the natural supplement, myo-inositol, to try to prevent lung cancer. In the patients whose lesions shrank after taking the supplement, PI3K also became less active, the researchers found. ""Together it gives us the story of the importance of this pathway,"" Bild added. ""Whether it is going to save millions of people, who knows?"" Slideshow (2 Images) Spira said he is working with Boston-based Allegro Diagnostics, which is halfway through a 60-patient clinical trial of the test. The researchers have patented their findings through the universities but Bild said myo-inositol supplements are cheap and freely available. Myo-inositol is also found in fruits, beans, grains and nuts, although Bild said the finding does not necessarily explain why people who eat more of these foods have a lower risk of cancer in general.",0,story_reviews_01596
"April 5, 2010 -- A new test may help identify smokers most at risk of developing emphysema. Researchers found that measuring blood flow patterns in the lungs using a new type of multidetector row CT (MDCT) scan revealed subtle changes that may lead to emphysema in smokers with otherwise normal lungs. Researcher Sara K. Alford of the University of Iowa, Iowa City, and colleagues say the results suggest that testing for blood flow disturbances in the lungs may provide an early warning for smokers most likely to develop the disease. Emphysema is an incurable, progressive lung disease that primarily affects smokers and causes shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. Although smoking is by far the most common cause of emphysema, some heavy smokers do not develop the disease for unknown reasons. Recent research suggests that certain people may be more susceptible to the disease because of differences in how their lung tissue responds to inhaling tobacco. In this study, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences, researchers found that inhaling tobacco smoke inflamed parts of the lungs and altered blood flow as the smoker's lungs attempted to get oxygen. Researchers say areas of low blood flow in inflamed lung tissue can promote tissue damage and inhibit repair of damaged tissues, which eventually develops into the symptoms of emphysema. In the study, researchers used MDCT scans to measure blood flow differences in 17 nonsmokers and 24 smokers. Based on differences in blood flow, researchers could tell the differences between people who had never smoked, people who smoked and had no signs of emphysema, and people who smoked and had subtle, early signs of emphysema. Based on the scans, people who had early signs of emphysema had the most disturbed blood flow patterns in otherwise healthy lungs. If confirmed by further studies, researchers say this type of testing could help determine who is most at risk of developing emphysema, measure the extent of the disease, and target and test new treatments for the disease.",0,story_reviews_01597
"Being able to walk half a block without feeling lightheaded is a big deal for Thomas Carbine. The 76-year-old Bloomingdale resident, who has a history of transient ischemic attacks — known as ""little strokes"" — and a 65 percent narrowing of an artery, is able to accomplish this feat because he took part in a stroke study at Central DuPage Hospital in Winfield. The hospital was one of 117 medical centers in the United States and Canada to participate in a National Institutes of Health clinical trial between 2000 and 2008. The 2,500 participants were used to compare carotid endarterectomy, a surgical procedure to clear blocked blood flow, to carotid artery stenting, a newer and less invasive procedure that involves threading a stent and expanding a small protective device in the artery to widen the blocked area and capture any dislodged plaque. The trial compared the safety and effectiveness of the two procedures in patients with or without a stroke history. ""Earlier studies were done for patients who had a high risk for surgery, were over the age of 80 and had previous heart attacks or other high risk factors for strokes,"" said Dr. Harish Shownkeen, an interventional neuroradiologist and co-medical director of the stroke and neurovascular program at Central DuPage Hospital. ""This trial was for lower-risk patients and for patients who had a narrowing of the arteries but had no symptoms for a stroke, but could possibly get a stroke down the line. They were also under the age of 80."" Shownkeen, one of the studies principal investigators, performed the non-surgical carotic artery stenting procedure on Carbine, a retired pipe fitter, in July 2008. Shownkeen has performed this particular technique since 1995. ""The stenting procedure is a quick ‘in and out' procedure,"" Shownkeen said. ""It takes me 15-30 minutes to do, the patient has very mild sedation and is completely awake, and I am talking to and evaluating the patient while I am doing the procedure. And the patient goes home in less than 23 hours. We call it a minimally invasive procedure because there are no cuts done anywhere. I just thread a catheter from the groin to the neck and put the stent in the area that is diseased or narrowed."" For Carbine, a father of four and grandfather of six, taking part in the study was well worth it. ""I feel great now,"" he said. ""It's made me feel like I'm going to live a lot longer."" He said his recuperation time was short. ""The day after the procedure, I even went to the store with my daughter. And now, I don't get dizzy and my whole body feels better."" Shownkeen said the new techniques are remarkable and offer hope to many. ""Stroke is the third-leading cause of death in the U.S. and the leading cause of disability in the U.S.,"" he said. ""I am glad that Mr. Carbine is doing well."" .",0,story_reviews_01600
"By Kathleen Doheny HealthDay Reporter FRIDAY, March 26, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Treatment with blood pressure-lowering drugs known as beta blockers appears to help reduce the spread of breast cancer in women, a team of British and German researchers report. The drugs are believed to work by preventing stress hormones from stimulating cancer cells. ""Beta- blocker drugs compete with stress hormones and bind to the same target receptors [on a cellular level], but unlike stress hormones, do not activate cancer cells,"" said Dr. Des Powe, a senior healthcare research scientist at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham University Hospital NHS Trust, in Nottingham, England. Powe is due to present the findings Friday at the annual European Breast Cancer Conference in Barcelona, Spain. Powe and his colleagues from the U.K. and Germany evaluated 466 cancer patients: 92 had received blood pressure-lowering medications and 43 of those 92, or nearly half, were on beta blockers at the time of their breast cancer diagnosis. Those on beta blockers had a substantial reduction in the formation of distant cancers, or metastases, and of local recurrence. They had a 71 percent reduced risk of death from breast cancer during the study compared to those who were either taking other blood pressure drugs or weren't on any blood pressure medications. Those on beta blockers also had a 57 percent reduced risk of getting a secondary cancer. ""Our study was performed retrospectively, using patient notes [from women] that had received treatment in the late 1980s and 1990s,"" Powe said. Other experts called the results interesting, but preliminary. ""The concept of controlling tumor growth by preventing a stress or inflammatory response is not novel,"" said Dr. Cathie Chung, a medical oncologist and an assistant professor of oncology at the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte, Calif. For instance, other research has found that women with breast cancer who regularly take aspirin, which is an anti-inflammatory, may have a decreased risk of recurrence. ""I think this study is interesting, but very far from being conclusive,"" said Chung. It's not known, she said, whether there is a true association or whether it may be due to chance or another factor. ""There is more work to be done before you can say whether this relationship is meaningful and will hold up,"" agreed Dr. Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer for the American Cancer Society. As in other retrospective studies, he said, more research is needed to verify the potential link. ""There are many other factors that come into play that could explain what happened,"" Lichtenfeld said. ""What if the women who take the beta blockers are more attuned to their health and they may be taking better care of themselves?"" Like Chung, he agreed the proposed association is not far-fetched, just that more study is needed. Previous research, Lichtenfeld said, has found a reduced rate of skin cancer among men who take another type of blood pressure-lowering drug. Powe said he plans to do another study to validate the results. More information To learn more about inflammation and cancer, visit the U.S. National Cancer Institute.",0,story_reviews_01603
"Well, it's about time. If men had menstrual cramps, I think we'd have more treatment options than Midol by now. OK, enough complaining. A British company is attempting to develop a medication designed to target the specific cause of menstrual cramps. The researchers presented data from a Phase 2 clinical trial Tuesday at the annual meeting of the American Chemical Society in San Francisco. Menstrual cramps are caused by contractions of the uterus and an increase in the hormone vasopressin. The goal of the experimental medication, called VA111913, is to block this hormone. The other remedies women use for relief -- painkillers and birth control pills -- only address the symptoms of menstrual cramps, not the cause. ""This is a different approach,"" said Andy Crockett, vice president of business development for Vantia Ltd., the company developing the drug. ""Right now, the current therapies for menstrual cramps are poorly tailored."" While half of all women experience some menstrual cramps, about 10% to 20% have a severe condition, called dysmenorrhea. ""It's one of the leading causes of work and school absenteeism in the United States,"" Crockett said. ""We certainly believe this drug has the potential to be a breakthrough."" It's still too soon to know if the drug will work, however. It has passed initial safety tests and is now being tested on 100 women in the United Kingdom and three U.S. sites (Peoria, Ariz.; Austin, Texas; and Salt Lake City). The findings from the Phase 2 trial are expected later this year, but it will be several more years until the medication, if proven safe and effective, makes it to the marketplace.

"MONDAY, March 22, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- The anti-clotting drug Plavix is of modest benefit in cutting the odds of death in patients with heart failure and heart attack who don't undergo angioplasty, a new study finds. Angioplasty is a procedure to open blocked arteries. Danish researchers analyzed data from more than 31,000 patients hospitalized with heart attack between 2000 and 2005 and divided the patients into four groups: two groups with heart failure (one that received Plavix and one that did not) and two groups without heart failure (one that received Plavix and one that did not). The mean follow-up was 18 months for both heart failure groups and just over two years for both non-heart failure groups. There were 812 deaths (32.2 percent) among heart failure patients not treated with Plavix and 709 deaths (28.1 percent) among heart failure patients treated with Plavix. There were 294 deaths (9.7 percent) among non-heart-failure patients not treated with Plavix and 285 deaths (9.4 percent) among non-heart failure patients who were given the drug. The study appears online March 23 and in the March 30 print issue of the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The value of giving clopidogrel (Plavix) to heart failure patients has been ""long debated,"" a researcher from the HeartDrug Research Laboratories at Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore wrote in an accompanying editorial. He said the benefit of the drug found in this study is ""of unquestionable practical importance,"" and added that the positive outcomes seen in a relatively short follow-up suggests potentially even better long-term survival. A randomized study comparing conventional heart failure therapy with and without Plavix ""is needed urgently,"" the editorial writer concluded.

"March 8, 2010 (Miami Beach, Fla.) -- Once again, cholesterol-lowering statin drugs have been shown to be good for more than the heart. Already linked to a reduced risk of rheumatoid arthritis, diabetes, multiple sclerosis, and cancer, statins also may help to improve symptoms of psoriasis, researchers report. In a study of 232 people taking medication for psoriasis, those who also took statins had fewer of the thick, red, scaly, itchy patches that are the hallmark sign of psoriasis, compared with people who didn't take the cholesterol-lowering drugs. ""There was a trend toward less severe psoriasis severity in people taking statins,"" says researcher Adam Perry, a fourth-year medical student at Emory University in Atlanta. The study is preliminary and doesn't prove cause and effect. And no one should start taking statins in an attempt to ward off psoriasis symptoms, doctors stress. But the findings, presented at the American Academy of Dermatology annual meeting, raise an interesting possibility worthy of further study, experts agree.",0,story_reviews_01621
"By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Feb. 23, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- A popular nutritional supplement -- extract of bitter melon -- may help protect women from breast cancer, researchers say. Bitter melon is a common vegetable in India, China and South America, and its extract is used in folk remedies for diabetes because of its blood-sugar lowering capabilities, according to the researchers. ""When we used the extract from that melon, we saw that it kills the breast cancer cells,"" said lead researcher Ratna Ray, a professor of pathology at Saint Louis University. But their work was done in a laboratory, not in humans, she noted. The bitter melon extract killed only the cancer cells, not the healthy breast cells. ""We didn't see any death in the normal cells,"" she said. However, these results are not proof that bitter melon extract prevents or cures breast cancer. ""I don't believe that it will cure cancer,"" Ray said. ""It will probably delay or perhaps have some prevention."" The report was published online Feb. 23 in advance of print publication March 1 in Cancer Research. For the study, Ray's team treated human breast cancer cells with bitter melon extract, which is sold in U.S. health food stores and over the Internet. The extract slowed the growth of these breast cancer cells and even killed them, the researchers found. The next step is to see if the team can repeat these findings in animals, Ray said. If so, human trials might follow. Eating bitter melon could also have a beneficial effect, Ray said. ""It has ingredients which are good for the health."" Those ingredients include Vitamin C and flavonoids. Marji McCullough, strategic director of nutritional epidemiology at the American Cancer Society, expressed interest in the findings. ""The results of this laboratory study are intriguing,"" McCullough said. ""But before recommending bitter melon extract supplements for cancer prevention, we need appropriate clinical trials to establish its safety and efficacy in humans."" For now, the cancer society recommends getting nutrients through foods, not supplements, McCullough said. This involves eating ""a plant-based diet including a variety of vegetables and fruits,"" she said. ""Many supplements have biologic activity, but before I recommend that people take isolated supplements they need to be tested in humans."" Current recommendations to prevent breast cancer include maintaining a healthy weight, limiting alcohol, exercising and eating a healthful diet, McCullough said.

"Feb. 22, 2010 -- Acupuncture may be an effective way to reduce depression during pregnancy, a new study shows. Many pregnant women who have symptoms of depression worry that taking antidepressants might harm their unborn babies -- so they stop taking their medications, say researchers at the Stanford University School of Medicine. Acupuncture might be a useful alternative, they say, because a study of pregnant women shows that the procedure works in reducing depressive symptoms better than other non-pharmacological techniques. The study included 150 pregnant women diagnosed with major depressive disorder. Some received depression-specific acupuncture treatments, others had needles inserted in acupuncture points not known to relieve depression, and a third group received massage therapy. All of the women received therapy for eight weeks and were interviewed at the four- and eight-week marks by someone who did not know which treatment they were getting. The researchers say 63% of the women who received depression-specific acupuncture reported a significant reduction in symptoms, compared to 44% of women in the other two groups combined. Remission rates were not significantly lower in the depression-specific acupuncture group compared to the other two groups. ""I hope that people will respect the rigorous methodology used in this blinded, randomized, controlled trial and accept the result,"" study researcher Deirdre Lyell, MD, assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Stanford University School of Medicine, says in a news release. Given that so many depressed women are reluctant to take antidepressants during pregnancy, ""it's important to find an alternative,"" study researcher Rachel Manber, PhD, professor of psychiatry and behavioral sciences at Stanford, says in the news release. Lyell says treatment of depression during pregnancy ""is critically important so that a woman can maintain her sense of well-being and take good care of herself, her fetus, and someday, her child."" The researchers say up to 14% of pregnant women may suffer from depression. The study is published in the March issue of Obstetrics & Gynecology.",1,story_reviews_01635
"Aspirin might reduce recurrence risk for breast cancer survivors, study finds Women who took aspirin two to five days per week were 60% less likely to have a recurrence and 71% less likely to die from the disease. But researchers caution that the results are preliminary. The results, reported Tuesday in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, are surprising because at least five large studies have shown that taking aspirin regularly has no effect on the risk of developing breast cancer in the first place. The study's authors described the findings as surprising and worthy of follow-up, but even they cautioned that survivors shouldn't yet begin prophylactic aspirin use. Women who take aspirin regularly after their breast cancer goes into remission are about 50% less likely to suffer a recurrence or to die from the disease, according to new findings from the ongoing Nurses' Health Study. The new results could be because the process of metastasis of breast cancer is different than that of initiation and could thus be susceptible to influence by aspirin. Or it could be simply that there is some other shared characteristic of women who took aspirin that produced the beneficial effect. Dr. John Glaspy, a breast cancer specialist at UCLA's Jonsson Comprehensive Cancer Center, called the results extremely interesting. ""If true, it would certainly be a relatively easy, inexpensive, potentially safe intervention for women who have had breast cancer,"" he said. But, he added, researchers ""have been tricked by things like this before, especially in cancer epidemiology."" The most notorious example was a study that showed a clear statistical link between drinking coffee and developing lung cancer. ""The problem turned out to be that smokers drank a lot of coffee. When you controlled for smoking, everything disappeared."" Breast cancer is expected to strike more than 192,000 American women this year, killing 40,170. Whether aspirin ultimately proves beneficial or not, doctors cautioned that women being treated for breast cancer should not take the medication. It can interfere with the therapy, producing severe side effects. The research is not without foundation. Metastasis is clearly linked to inflammation, and aspirin reduces inflammation. Studies in laboratory dishes show that aspirin can inhibit the growth and invasiveness of breast cancer cells and stimulate the immune system to attack the cells. Based on these lab studies, Dr. Michelle Holmes of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston and her colleagues studied self-reported data from 4,164 female nurses enrolled in the hospital's Nurses' Health Study who were diagnosed with breast cancer between 1976 and 2002. By 2006, there had been 400 recurrences and 341 deaths among the nurses. The team collected data on the women's aspirin use beginning 12 months after diagnosis, when the treatment was presumably finished. They found that women who took aspirin two to five days per week were 60% less likely to have a recurrence and 71% less likely to diefrom breast cancer. Those taking it more frequently had a 43% lower risk of recurrence and a 64% lower risk of death. The researchers found no benefit from taking acetaminophen, best known as Tylenol. Taking aspirin once a week produced no benefit. The researchers did not monitor aspirin dosage, but the majority of the women taking aspirin did so for its heart benefit, and thus were taking 81 milligrams per day, less than a normal dose. These women may have been more health conscious than other women in the study, and it is possible that other actions on their part were responsible for their improved survival, experts noted. Holmes said she would not yet recommend that breast cancer patients in remission begin taking aspirin solely for that purpose. But those taking it for other reasons, she said, might inadvertently be helping themselves prevent a recurrence. thomas.maugh@ latimes.com",0,story_reviews_01636
"En Español By Ellin Holohan HealthDay Reporter WEDNESDAY, Feb. 17, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Regular use of ibuprofen, a common anti-inflammatory drug, significantly lowers the risk for developing Parkinson's disease, Harvard researchers report. People who took three or more tablets a week showed a 40 percent lower risk than those who didn't take the common pain reliever, their study found. Study author Dr. Xiang Gao, an instructor and epidemiologist at Harvard Medical School and Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston, said the findings are important for anyone at increased risk for Parkinson's because most people with the disease eventually become severely disabled. ""There is thus a need for better preventive interventions,"" Gao said. ""In this context, our findings regarding the potential neuroprotective effect of ibuprofen, one of the most commonly used analgesics, on Parkinson's disease may have important public health and clinical implications."" Parkinson's is a disease that affects nerve cells in the brain that control the movement of muscles. It affects an estimated 1 million people in the United States, men far more often than women. The exact cause is unknown, but experts believe it's a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Gao said that though the drug levodopa is the current standard treatment for Parkinson's, much more is needed. He is scheduled to present the findings in Toronto at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April. The findings came from an analysis of data on 136,474 people who did not have Parkinson's at the start of the study. In a six-year span, 293 were diagnosed with the disease. Those who took the largest doses of ibuprofen were less likely to have developed Parkinson's than were those who took smaller amounts of the drug, the study found. No other pain reliever was found to lower the risk for Parkinson's. Dr. Michele Tagliati, an associate professor of neurology and director of the Parkinson's Disease Center at the Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City, described the results as somewhat surprising and said they emphasized the need for further study. ""It's intriguing [that the finding applied to] just ibuprofen and not aspirin or acetaminophen or other commonly prescribed medications for inflammation because it implies something more specific to ibuprofen that should be investigated,"" Tagliati said. ""So it narrows the focus to a subgroup of [anti-inflammatory drugs]."" Tagliati called the study ""eye-opening."" Parkinson's is not considered an inflammatory disease, he said, adding: ""We might be missing something. There is more work to be done."" But in the meantime, Tagliati said, he would ""definitely discuss ibuprofen use"" with his patients because, if it works to protect against the disease, it could very well benefit those who already have it. He cautioned that persistent use of ibuprofen can lead to gastritis, or inflammation of the stomach lining, but said that, in comparison, ""there is very little to lose when measuring its side effects against the effects of Parkinson's,"" which can include loss of balance, stiffness, hallucinations and dementia.

"A nasal spray containing a hormone that is known to make women more maternal and men less shy apparently can help those with autism make eye contact and interact better with others, according to a provocative study released Monday. The study, involving 13 adults with either a high-functioning form of autism or Asperger syndrome, a mild form of the disorder, found that when the subjects inhaled the hormone oxytocin, they scored significantly better on a test that involved recognizing faces and performed much better in a game that involved tossing a ball with others. Although more research is needed to confirm and explore the findings, the results are the latest in a growing body of evidence indicating that the hormone could lead to ways to help people with the often devastating brain disorder function better. ""This is the first study that looked at whether oxytocin has an effect on social behavior, which is a major deficit in autism,"" said Angela Sirigu, who directs the National Center for Scientific Research in France and led the study, published online by the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. ""It looks like it could be very helpful."" Researchers who were not involved in the study praised the work, saying the findings were promising and could lead to the first effective treatment for the central problems affecting people with autism. ""I think it's going to be a very exciting finding for a lot of people,"" said Alex Martin, chief of cognitive neuropsychology at the National Institute of Mental Health. Because oxytocin does not last long in the body and produces its effects for a relatively brief period, some experts said the findings were more likely to encourage drug companies to develop alternative substances that had the same benefits. ""This paper suggests that's worth doing,"" said Thomas R. Insel, director of the institute. ""It adds another brick in the wall that suggests there may be an opportunity to develop treatment for one of the core symptoms of autism. That's been the brass ring."" But Sirigu was among those who said the finding should encourage more research on the potential benefits of oxytocin itself, especially for children. Administering the hormone soon after a child's autism is diagnosed might help him or her develop more normally, she said. ""It's possible it can become a cure, if it's given early when the problems are detected in the little kids,"" Sirigu said. ""We can change the way these patients interact with people from childhood."" Because previous research has indicated that some people with autism might have abnormally low levels of oxytocin, conducting tests to identify those people and administering them the hormone might help as well, said Karen Parker, an assistant professor of psychiatry at Stanford University School of Medicine. ""If you can find someone who appears to have deficits in oxytocin biology, giving them what you might argue would be replacement oxytocin may be helpful,"" Parker said. Autism is a baffling disorder that can cause a variety of symptoms, including speech and learning problems and profound, disabling difficulties understanding emotions and social cues when interacting with people. The number of children found to have autism has been increasing for reasons that remain mysterious. Oxytocin is produced naturally in the bodies of humans and animals. It plays a key role in social interaction, promoting maternal behavior and monogamy in animals. The hormone also heightens social sensitivity, social awareness, generosity and trust in people. Previous U.S. studies found that people with autism who received the hormone intravenously were less likely to engage in repetitive behavior that is another hallmark of autism and were more likely to be able to identify emotions in voices. Another study being published in the journal Biological Psychiatry found that 16 autistic males in Australia ages 12 to 19 who received the hormone through a nasal spray were better able to recognize other people's facial expressions. ""All the data seem to suggest that manipulating the oxytocin system has a powerful effect on the core symptoms of autism,"" said Eric Hollander, director of the compulsive, impulsive and autism spectrum disorders program at the Montefiore Medical Center in New York. While cautioning that more research is needed on children and additional patients to make sure oxytocin is safe and effective, advocates for families with children with autism welcomed the findings. Oxytocin has been in use for several years as an ""alternative"" therapy for autism. ""Many families are using it with success and reporting improvement,"" said Wendy Fournier, president of the National Autism Association. ""Getting double-blind clinical studies like this one published helps to bring credibility to parental reports."" ""We need to be mindful of the fact that the majority of human studies of oxytocin have been conducted using adults, including this study, and only one paper has included individuals between the ages of 12 and 18. We have to be careful about the safety and efficacy of oxytocin on pediatric populations,"" said Clara Lajonchere, vice president of clinical programs for Autism Speaks.",0,story_reviews_01638
"En Español By Randy Dotinga HealthDay Reporter THURSDAY, Feb. 11, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Just in time for Valentine's Day comes word that eating dark chocolate appears to lower your risk of stroke or lessen the likelihood of death after a stroke. But the findings, based on a review of existing research, aren't conclusive, and they don't prove that chocolate is good for your heart. And dietitians say too much chocolate can be harmful. Still, two of the three studies analyzed in the review provide yet another suggestion that health benefits lurk in chocolate, dark chocolate in particular, said review co-author Dr. Gustavo Saposnik. If choosing among white chocolate, milk chocolate or dark chocolate, ""I'd definitely go with the dark chocolate,"" said Saposnik, director of the Stroke Research Unit at St. Michael's Hospital in Toronto. The review authors, who found three studies on chocolate consumption and stroke between 2001 and 2009, are scheduled to report their findings at the American Academy of Neurology's annual meeting in Toronto in April. One study found no significant association between chocolate consumption and risk of stroke or death from stroke. But another found that the stroke rate was 22 percent lower in people who ate chocolate once a week, and a third reported that death from stroke was 46 percent lower in those who ate 50 grams of chocolate once a week. The health benefit may come from antioxidants called flavonoids that are present in chocolate, Saposnik said. Antioxidants are thought to prevent cell damage. In years past, ""the message was that chocolate consumption might be associated with higher LDL [bad] cholesterol or perhaps higher incidence of cardiovascular disease,"" he said. ""Today, we know that all chocolates are not the same."" So, should you and your sweetheart add dark chocolate to your diet? ""I'm not sure we can provide any recommendation at this time,"" Saposnik said. For one thing, it's possible that some factor other than chocolate could be helping lower the risk of stroke. Those who eat more chocolate could be wealthier and have better access to health care, for instance, or go to the gym more often. Saposnik said more studies will help clarify the association between chocolate and stroke risk. For now, said registered dietitian Katie Clark, ""caution should be taken not to promote chocolate as a health food,"" even though it's fine in moderation. Chocolate is a major source of saturated fat, which raises bad cholesterol and boosts heart disease risk, said Clark, an assistant clinical professor at the University of California at San Francisco. But Keith-Thomas Ayoob, an associate professor at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City who studies nutrition, said chocolate does have its benefits. ""Several studies indicate that even a little chocolate can help reduce blood pressure and increase blood flow through the arteries. Both are good for heart health,"" he said. ""It's nice to know that chocolate isn't bad for you, assuming you eat modest amounts and don't become overweight by overeating it.""

"(CNN) -- Eating a diet rich in healthy fats and limiting dairy and meat could do more than keep your heart healthier. It could also help keep you thinking clearly. New research shows that sticking to the Mediterranean diet, previously shown to reduce heart and other health issues, also may help lower the risk of having small areas of dead tissue linked to thinking problems. Known as brain infarcts, they're involved in vascular dementia, the second most common form of dementia, after Alzheimer's disease. ""We've got these diseases of aging that cause disability, cost a ton of money to treat and manage, and wreck people's lives,"" said Dr. Gregory Cole, a professor of medicine and neurology at the University of California, Los Angeles, who was not involved in this new study. ""You've got to get in there and figure out what actually works for prevention, and not have people guessing."" A Mediterranean diet includes a lot of fruit, vegetables and fish, olive oil, legumes and cereals, and fewer dishes containing dairy, meat, poultry, and saturated fatty acids than other diets. It also involves small to moderate amounts of alcohol. The study relates diet to strokes, said Dr. Nikolaos Scarmeas, a neurologist at Columbia University Medical Center and lead author of the study. The research will be presented at the annual meeting of the American Academy of Neurology in April. An infarct, a kind of stroke, happens when the passage of blood is slowed or completely blocked by clotting. This study looked at people who had never had a clinical stroke, but may have had smaller strokes that went unnoticed. An MRI brain scan can detect these small strokes. The study looked at 712 people over the age of 65 living in New York. Participants were asked about their diet and then, about six years later, underwent an MRI. In general, dietary patterns are consistent for at least seven or eight years, Scarmeas said. Researchers found that people who most closely followed a Mediterranean-like diet were 36 percent less likely to have areas of brain damage, compared with those whose eating habits were furthest from the diet. The study shows association, not causation, meaning there could be some other factors linking the Mediterranean diet to resilience against this form of brain damage. For example, other research has found that higher adherence to the diet seems to protect against hypertension, also associated with these brain problems. But in this new research, when the scientists controlled for hypertension, the diet was still linked to a lower risk of brain damage. It is possible that the diet protects the brain vessels themselves, irrespective of other problems such as high blood pressure, Scarmeas said. The participants who followed the Mediterranean diet the least had an increased risk for having strokes that was similar to people with hypertension. Those who most strongly adhered to the dietary regimen had a level of protection similar to people who did not have hypertension. Scarmeas' previous research has shown that the Mediterranean diet may reduce the risk of Alzheimer's disease. Looking at 2,250 individuals from the Washington Heights-Inwood Columbia Aging Project, researchers found a 40 percent lower risk among those who stuck to this diet, scientists reported in the Annals of Neurology in 2006. The people involved in the brain infarcts study are a subset of that original group. As many as 2.4 million to 4.5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, according to the National Institute on Aging. Between 1 and 4 percent of people over the age of 65 have vascular dementia, according to the Mayo Clinic. Other studies have suggested that this food regimen may help in preventing second heart attacks, lowering cancer risk and stopping the need for diabetes drugs in patients with type 2 diabetes. The new study ""gives you better evidence than ever that this is actually protective, and protective against the development of dementia,"" Cole said. The risk factors for vascular disease overlap with those of Alzheimer's disease, he said. These include high blood pressure, high-fat diets, type 2 diabetes and low folate intake. People who have both Alzheimer's and vascular disease -- a condition called mixed dementia -- have a more rapid progression of Alzheimer's disease, Cole said. A subsequent issue to address is whether a person must follow the entire Mediterranean diet in order to reap these benefits, or whether there are portions of it that contribute positive effects, Cole said. It would be easier for people to focus on adding particular elements to their diets -- for example, by taking fish oil capsules -- rather than trying to readjust their eating habits altogether. Cole's own research deals with fish oil, which is relevant because fish is a component in the Mediterranean diet. The bottom line for dementia is that fish oil may help in the very early stages, but more research must be done to confirm this, he said. In a study, his group found that DHA fatty acids from fish oil could delay or deter the onset of Alzheimer's disease in rats or older mice that had been genetically altered to develop the condition. Also, a recent study found that the DHA component of fish oil from algae helped people with minor memory impairment, but this needs to be replicated in order to be more definitive, he said. When Scarmeas' group looked at the individual components of the diet, they found a stronger association between the overall diet and brain damage prevention than with any individual food in the diet, suggesting that the combination all of the elements may be producing the effect, Scarmeas said. Researchers will continue to follow the participants in the study and check in on them every year and a half, Scarmeas said. The next step would be to have controlled experiments concerning food and dementia in which participants are randomly assigned to follow a diet, Cole said. It is complicated in general to compare the benefits of a particular diet with the benefits of not following a different food regimen.",0,story_reviews_01643
"LONDON (Reuters) - Scientists have used an ""artificial pancreas"" system of pumps and monitors to improve blood sugar control in diabetes patients in the first study to show the new device works better than conventional treatment. Researchers from Britain's Cambridge University tested the device on 17 children with type 1 diabetes during a series of nights in hospital and found it kept their blood sugar levels within the important ""normal"" range for 60 percent of the time. The new system, which involves patients wearing a matchbox-sized monitor and a similar-sized pump with a tube to deliver insulin into the body, also halved the amount of time blood sugar dropped to worrying or dangerous levels, they said. Medical device makers have been working for years to develop a so-called artificial pancreas to deliver insulin to patients with type 1 diabetes, an autoimmune disease in which the body destroys its own ability to make insulin. The bodies of type 1 diabetes sufferers become unable to properly break down sugar and if untreated, blood vessels and nerves are destroyed, organs fail and patients die. ""These devices could transform the management of type 1 diabetes, but it is likely to be a gradual process,"" Roman Hovorka of Cambridge, who led the research, said in a telephone interview. He said the results were ""an important stepping stone"" toward bringing an artificial pancreas to the commercial market, but predicted several years yet of refinement before it could be used day and night by patients in normal life. ""It's a bit like with mobile phones. When we started, the technology wasn't very good and the functionality was limited, and it took a number of generations to move to the device that we have now. I see the same thing with this system."" The Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation said last month it was teaming up with U.S. drugmaker Johnson & Johnson's unit Animas, which makes insulin pumps, and DexCom Inc, which makes continuous glucose monitoring devices, to develop and test an artificial pancreas system. The Cambridge study, published in The Lancet medical journal on Friday, used devices and sensors from Smiths Medical, a unit of Smiths Group, Abbott Diabetes Care, a unit of Abbott Laboratories, and Medtronic. The ultimate goal is to create a device that can check patients blood day and night, during and between meals, and deliver insulin as required. The Cambridge study found their device performed better than a conventional pump, which delivers insulin at pre-set rates and which kept blood sugar levels around normal for 40 percent of the time compared with 60 percent for the artificial pancreas. Hovorka said the findings were particularly encouraging because the study included nights when the children went to bed after eating a large evening meal or having done exercise — both of which can affect blood sugar levels.",1,story_reviews_01646
"Feb. 4, 2010 - It has been called the Holy Grail of treatment for insulin-dependent diabetes, and it may be close to reality. For decades, researchers have searched unsuccessfully for ways to automatically coordinate insulin delivery with real-time changes in blood sugar to essentially create an artificial pancreas that maintains target blood sugar levels with minimal effort. Now new technology is making this possible, and new research shows that an experimental system can improve nighttime blood sugar control. Using sophisticated computer software, researchers were able to coordinate the actions of a commercially available continuous glucose monitoring device and insulin pump to allow automatic insulin delivery in response to real-time glucose readings. The system proved better than a conventional insulin pump for maintaining optimal blood sugar levels during the night in a study from the U.K.'s University of Cambridge. Aaron J. Kowalski, PhD, of the Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation, which was involved in funding the research, says the study represents an important step forward in the search for a clinically feasible artificial pancreas to improve outcomes and quality of life among insulin-dependent diabetes patients. ""This is hugely promising and very significant research,"" he tells WebMD. ""Nighttime is the time of day that strikes fear into patients and parents of children with diabetes.""",0,story_reviews_01648
"NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Monitoring high-risk pregnancies with ultrasound tests may help prevent some fetal and newborn deaths, a new research review finds. The review assessed a technology called Doppler ultrasound, which measures blood flow through the umbilical cord. Abnormal findings indicate that the fetus may be under stress. Doppler ultrasound, done in the third trimester, is an established way to monitor high-risk pregnancies — those complicated by problems like poor fetal growth or health conditions in the mother, such as high blood pressure and heart and kidney diseases. Still, the benefits of such monitoring had not been entirely clear. There have been concerns that abnormal findings on Doppler ultrasound may prompt doctors to sometimes unnecessarily intervene — by, for instance, performing a cesarean section. But in the new review, researchers found that across 16 studies of more than 10,000 high-risk pregnancies, Doppler ultrasound testing was linked to a 29 percent reduction in fetal and newborn deaths. Among women who did not receive ultrasound monitoring, 1.7 percent suffered a fetal or newborn death, versus 1.2 percent of women who underwent ultrasound. The benefit seemed to stem from better decisions on C-sections and inductions of labor, according to the researchers, led by Dr. Zarko Alfirevic of the University of Liverpool in the UK. He and his colleagues report their review findings in the Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, which is published by the Cochrane Collaboration, an international research organization that evaluates medical studies. In an interview, Alfirevic said that the evidence supports using Doppler in high-risk pregnancies where the mother has high blood pressure or the fetus is abnormally small. In these cases, the fetus may not be getting enough nutrients and oxygen through the placenta. ""These women really should have a Doppler investigation of the umbilical artery,"" Alfirevic said. Typically, high-risk women would receive other types prenatal testing as well, such as electronic fetal-heart monitoring. ""We're just saying this (Doppler ultrasound) should be part of it,"" Alfirevic said. In practice, Doppler ultrasound may also be recommended for women who have diabetes or are having a prolonged pregnancy (beyond 42 weeks). But there is not yet strong evidence that these women benefit, Alfirevic said. In general, he and his colleagues found, the trials included in the review, which were mainly done in the 1990s, had their shortcomings. Some had flaws in their design, while in other cases the researchers failed to provide details on key elements of the study design. However, with Doppler an established technique for monitoring high-risk pregnancies, Alfirevic said it is very unlikely that any future studies will test Doppler against no Doppler — as most studies in this review did. Research, according to Alfirevic, has moved on to other questions, including how to best manage abnormal findings from a Doppler scan. In some cases, early delivery may be the best course, but it is unclear whether other options — such as bed rest or tighter blood pressure control in a woman with high blood pressure — are effective. Another question, Alfirevic said, is whether ultrasounds of blood vessels other than the umbilical artery might improve pregnancy outcomes. One thing that is clear, the researcher stressed, is that Doppler ultrasound is not necessary for women with average, healthy pregnancies. ""There is no evidence to suggest that it should be done in low-risk women,"" Alfirevic said. SOURCE: Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, January 2010.",0,story_reviews_01659
"En Español By Ed Edelson HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Jan. 12, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Blood pressure drugs that block the protein angiotensin appear to reduce the risk of developing Alzheimer's disease and other forms of dementia, a new study finds. ""We think it [angiotensin] is one of the most important factors determining healthy blood vessels and also acts in the brain to help neurons to be a little more resilient,"" said Dr. Benjamin Wolozin, a professor of pharmacology and neurology at Boston University and senior author of a report on the findings, published online Jan. 13 in BMJ. That report describes a study of more than 819,000 U.S. veterans, nearly all men, that found that those taking blood pressure medications that block cell receptors for angiotensin had a lower risk for dementia than those taking other cardiovascular medicines. A similar but smaller protective effect was found for a related drug, lisinopril (Prinivil, Zestril), which blocks production of the active form of angiotensin. Angiotensin causes blood vessels to constrict, raising blood pressure. It is produced when enzymes act to convert a precursor molecule, angiotensinogen. Lisinopril is a member of a drug family called ACE (angiotensin-converting enzyme) inhibitors. Other examples of ACE inhibitors are benazepril (Lotensin), enalapril (Vasotec) and ramipril (Altace). Reducing angiotensin production by giving ACE inhibitors can lower blood pressure. The same effect can be achieved with drugs that block the cell receptors through which angiotensin acts. Called angiotensin receptor blockers, these drugs have a greater protective effect against dementia than ACE inhibitors, the study found. Such drugs include candesartan (Atacand), irbesartan (Avapro), losartan (Cozaar) and valsartan (Diovan). In the study, men taking an angiotensin receptor blocker had a 24 percent lower incidence of dementia than those taking other cardiovascular drugs. The risk was 19 percent lower for men taking ACE inhibitors. The risk was nearly halved for those taking both angiotensin-targeting drugs. In men with Alzheimer's disease, use of an angiotensin receptor blocker reduced admission to nursing homes by half. Combined angiotensin medication therapy reduced nursing home admissions by two-thirds. Wolozin said that it's not clear why the drugs would have a beneficial effect on the brain, but improved blood flow probably plays a role. ""If you get no blood to the brain, you're not going to think well,"" he said. ""Also, in brain cells there is more than one kind of angiotensin receptor. By blocking bad receptors, you are left with the good ones so that helps neurons become more resilient."" But the evidence is not sufficient to support routine use of angiotensin receptor blockers to prevent Alzheimer's disease, Wolozin said. The new report describes an observational study, one that lacks the strict controls that are needed for convincing proof. ""Any study like this is hypothesis-generating,"" he said. ""You only know for sure when you have done clinical prospective trials."" His advice for anyone considering angiotensin receptors blockers to reduce dementia risk: ""They should consult with their physicians."" There are potential hazards, such as too-low blood pressure that can lead to damaging falls, Wolozin said. Caution was urged by Dr. Richard B. Lipton, vice chairman of neurology at Albert Einstein College of Medicine in New York City, who has done work on the genetics of Alzheimer's disease. The angiotensin hypothesis makes sense, Lipton said, because improved blood flow to the brain helps nerve cells and reduces formation of Alzheimer's-related amyloid protein. But there have been a number of observational studies implicating various molecules, including estrogens, in dementia, he said. ""The sequence is that when you do the randomized trial, you don't get the same effect,"" Lipton said. On the other hand, such randomized trials usually include people who are close to having Alzheimer's disease, and ""it could be different if you gave the drugs earlier,"" Lipton said.

"Souvenaid sounds like a cool drink to be sipped while reading Proust in the garden. But new research suggests that the cocktail of nutrients soon to be marketed under that name may boost the production of brain cells lost in Alzheimer's and slow the loss of verbal memory in the disease's early stages. A study published Thursday in the journal Alzheimer's and Dementia found that among 225 subjects diagnosed with early Alzheimer's disease, those who drank the nutrient cocktail twice a day for 12 weeks improved their performance on tests of verbal memory compared with newly diagnosed subjects who got a placebo drink. The study is the first to suggest that a ""medical food"" might be effective in stemming -- and perhaps reversing -- the cognitive tolls of Alzheimer's. Souvenaid is expected to hit the American market in a test program as early as this spring, marketed by the French giant Danone, maker of Dannon yogurt, and its Nutricia subsidiary. The nutrient cocktail emerged from research conducted by Dr. Richard Wurtman, a neuropharmacologist and physician at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. It contains a mix of nutrients all found in breast milk, and which are either produced naturally by the body or ingested in foods. Earlier research had found that the mix of nutrients -- uridine, choline and Omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids -- ""synergistically"" boosts the volume of proteins in the brain that give rise to synapses -- the branching structures that pass electrical impulses from cell to cell in the brain. The loss of synapses -- particularly in the hippocampal region, which is key to memory formation -- is one of several hallmarks of Alzheimer's disease. Wurtman said in an interview that if a mix of nutrients that so far have shown no side effects could stem or reverse that synamptic loss, it could become a valuable weapon in future physicians' arsenal against Alzheimer's. Nigel Hughes, head of Nutricia's North American unit, said in an interview that three other clinical trials are underway to test the effectiveness and safety of Souvenaid, and that a full market roll-out could begin in the U.S. by next year. Though the proposed Alzheimer's cocktail, as a dietary supplement, does not need approval by the Food and Drug Administration before it can be marketed, Hughes said the company ""is adopting the principles you would adopt for going to market with a pharmaceutical product,"" including clinical evidence that it works. As a ""medical food,"" Hughes said the company anticipates that Souvenaid would be ""taken under medical supervision."" Will Souvenaid become a voguish cocktail for aging smarties keen to hold off the cognitive decline that comes with age? Already, the Alzheimer's drug donepezil (marketed as Aricept) has been tested as a cognitive enhancement drug, and some consider taking it to be worth the risk. (The FDA, however, has pointedly declined to approve Aricept's marketing even for mild cognitive impairment, a loss of memory that is more serious than normal decline, but which leads frequently to Alzheimer's.) One of the three large trials underway will test Souvenaid on European subjects with mild cognitive impairment. If that trial shows success, you can bet that the cocktail may be the next big thing among the middle-aged smart set. --Melissa Healy",0,story_reviews_01677
"By Amanda Gardner HealthDay Reporter FRIDAY, Jan. 1, 2010 (HealthDay News) -- Three-quarters of patients undergoing surgery for stubborn sinusitis saw significant improvements in their quality of life, new research shows. Most of the remaining 25 percent also saw some improvement, just not as dramatic, said Dr. Timothy Smith, lead author of a study appearing in the January issue of Otolaryngology -- Head and Neck Surgery. ""Certainly this reinforces our belief that sinus surgery increases the quality of life of patients, and I see that clinically as well as scientifically,"" added Dr. Jordan S. Josephson, a sinus and allergy specialist at Lenox Hill Hospital in New York City. ""Previous studies have been single-center studies, and this is a bigger study using multiple centers and using a fairly large population, so it further says sinus surgery is a really good thing to do if you need it."" Chronic rhinosinusitis (CRS) affects a sizable minority -- 14 percent to 16 percent -- of U.S. residents. The condition, marked by symptoms such as sinus pain and pressure, headache, stuffy nose and sneezing, can compromise quality of life more than even congestive heart failure, back pain or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the study authors said. Endoscopic sinus surgery has been performed in the United States since the mid-1980s, said Smith, who is director of the Oregon Sinus Center at Oregon Health & Science University in Portland. ""It's a minimally invasive type of surgery performed with a telescope that goes into the nostril,"" then basically snips away abnormal and interfering tissue while leaving normal tissue behind, Smith explained. Smith and his co-authors studied 302 patients with CRS from three academic medical centers, following them for an average of a year and a half after their surgery. ""These were patients who have chronic sinusitis so, by definition, they have at least three months of symptoms and they have evidence of an ongoing inflammation or infection of their nose and sinuses on either a CT scan or an examination of the nose and sinuses,"" Smith said. Following the surgery, about 76 percent of patients had ""clinically significant"" improvement in quality of life, as measured by various validated scales. Patients with worse disease at the outset seemed to fare the best after the procedure, as did those undergoing surgery for the first time. This second finding is probably explained by the fact that people going for second or further surgeries were probably sicker to begin with, Josephson said. None of which is to say that patients shouldn't try medical therapies first, he added. ""I don't think it means everyone with CRS should consider surgery. They should try medical therapy, and if medical therapy fails and the surgeon feels that part of the problem is anatomic, then surgery would be a good tool for them to use,"" Josephson said. ""Some people with stage 1 and 2 diseases may even get cured. This is a wonderful renewed hope of feeling better.""

"En Español By Steven Reinberg HealthDay Reporter TUESDAY, Dec. 29, 2009 (HealthDay News) -- Many older adults consume ginkgo biloba, hoping to keep their minds sharp, but a new study finds that the herbal product doesn't stave off cognitive decline. ""Measuring the effect of ginkgo in a big trial in older people, we didn't see any effect of the drug on slowing down or delaying normal age-related changes of cognition,"" said lead researcher Dr. Steven T. DeKosky, vice president and dean of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville. ""If you are older and thinking 'I'll try ginkgo to preserve brain health,' we have no evidence that it is useful,"" he said. ""I won't take it anymore."" The report, published in the Dec. 23-30 issue of the Journal of the American Medical Association, supports the findings of earlier, smaller studies. To test ginkgo's effect on cognitive decline, DeKosky's group looked at results from the ginkgo Evaluation of Memory study, which included 3,069 community-dwelling adults 72 to 96 years of age. The participants, who were generally healthy when the study began, either took 120 milligrams of ginkgo or placebo twice a day and were routinely tested for cognitive abilities. Over more than six years of follow-up, the researchers found no evidence that ginkgo delayed or prevented normal declines in memory, language, attention, visuospatial abilities or executive functions, such as anticipating outcomes and adapting to changing situations and thinking abstractly. These results remained the same regardless of sex, age, race or education, the researchers noted. However, ginkgo was safe and no serious side effects were noted, DeKosky added. ""The good news is it appeared that it was fairly safe; the bad news was it didn't seem to do anything at least as far as trying to slow down the cognitive changes of aging."" Earlier results from the same study found that ginkgo did not prevent or slow the development of Alzheimer's or other dementias, DeKosky said. The American Botanical council took issue with the findings, however. ""There are many significant limitations of this study,"" Mark Blumenthal, council founder and executive director said in a statement. ""First, the data being published this week are drawn from a previous clinical trial which was not designed to determine the decline in cognition. Second, about 40 percent of the subjects dropped out over the six-year duration of the trial; the statistics reported in the study include the dropouts for which no final data are available,"" Blumenthal said. ""Further, the subjects in the study were not monitored for certain cognitive parameters until several years after the trial began, creating difficulty in determining accurately whether they experienced a decline in cognition or not. Also, the age of the subjects is quite advanced, at an average of 79 years at the beginning of the trial. This age group is not typical of the age of both healthy people and those with mild cognitive impairment who use ginkgo for improving mental performance."" Another group, the Council for Responsible Nutrition (CRN), which represents the dietary supplement industry, also had reservations about the study. In a statement, Douglas MacKay, CRN's vice president of scientific and regulatory affairs, said that ""there is a large body of previously published evidence, as well as ongoing trials, which suggest that ginkgo biloba is effective for helping to improve cognitive impairment in older adults."" He added that, ""as a former practicing naturopathic doctor, I have had the benefit of working with patients and have seen firsthand how ginkgo biloba can be effective in improving cognitive function."" Ginkgo biloba is believed to have antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties that protect cell membranes and help govern the workings of the brain's chemical messengers, or neurotransmitters. Dr. Lon S. Schneider, director of the state of California's Alzheimer's Disease Research and Clinical Center at the University of Southern California, Los Angeles, said that these findings were ""straightforward and expected."" No measurable effect from ginkgo is seen on cognition, Schneider said. ""Regardless of whether people say 'I take it and I feel better,' you just don't see an effect,"" he said. Still, Schneider won't object if someone wants to try it. ""It is not in my position to deflate hope,"" he said. ""If someone really feels they need to take this and they need to try it, well go ahead and do it. But their expectations should be realistic, and if they don't experience anything, then they probably should stop.""

"Dec. 29, 2009 -- Scientists at the Dana-Farber Cancer Institute say they have developed a compound that may be capable of halting a common type of drug-resistant lung cancer. Their study is published in the Dec. 24/31 issue of the journal Nature. The researchers say the framework of the new compound is different from that of other cancer drugs and acts against a protein that carries a structural defect, according to a news release. That protein is known as an epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) kinase. The scientists say non-small cell lung cancers that had become invulnerable to the chemotherapy drugs Iressa and Tarceva were stymied in a study by a compound designed and formulated in the Dana-Farber laboratory. The researchers say their new compound shows how fast lung cancer research and development are moving forward. The Dana-Farber scientists say current [EGFR] inhibitors Iressa and Tarceva prevent EGFR from sending signals that are essential to keep tumor cells growing, the researchers say. However, over time, the tumor cells develop additional mutations, enabling them to grow again, even in the presence of the drugs Iressa or Tarceva. The scientists say in the news release that not only did they find that a compound called WZ4002 can slow tumor growth, but that it is possible to ""selectively target the drug-resistant mutant EGFR in tumors, with relatively less effect on the normal EGFR in health tissues."" Much work lies ahead in determining whether the compound and related ones will prove to be effective therapies, but the researchers say their discovery demonstrates the power of screening specially designed compounds against cancers ""with certain genetic quirks."" It's early to discuss the use of such compounds in patients, the scientists say, but one of the researchers, Michael J. Eck, MD, PhD, also of Dana-Farber, says he's optimistic their approach ""will lead to an effective treatment for the thousands of non-small cell lung cancer patients worldwide who develop resistance to Iressa and Tarceva every year."" The new compound seems promising in mouse models, the researchers say, adding they hope it proves effective in clinical trials and is better tolerated than drugs now used. Lung cancer is the most common cause of cancer death in the U.S. for men and women. Non-small cell lung cancer constitutes about 85-90% of lung cancer cases.",0,story_reviews_01684
